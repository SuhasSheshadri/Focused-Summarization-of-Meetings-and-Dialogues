   <sent nite:id="ES2005bID.s.1">This meeting was very productive.</sent>  <sent nite:id="ES2005bID.s.2">We began with presentations from the marketing and user interface designer, who told us about the needs and desire of our hip young consumer market.</sent>  <sent nite:id="ES2005bID.s.3">Next, I gave my spiel about industrial design and whatnot, making sure to inject some sarcasm and humor along with the presentation.</sent>  <sent nite:id="ES2005bID.s.4">Ultimately, we voted and came to a consensus that our product should have a sleek exterior design -- "organic" as Helen called it -- and a novel feature: automatic speech recognition.</sent>  <sent nite:id="ES2005bID.s.5">This feature would not only reduce the clutter of buttons, but would allow a user to find a lost remote, or even to continue using a remote control that was lost, but within range.</sent>
