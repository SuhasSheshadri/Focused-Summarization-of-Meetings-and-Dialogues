   <sent nite:id="ES2008bME.s.1">This afternoon we went over the user requirements, technical functions design and working design by listening to three presentations and some additional moderation and discussion led by the project manager.</sent> <sent nite:id="ES2008bME.s.2">The needs and desires that were emphasized were: fashion, functionality and simplicity.</sent> <sent nite:id="ES2008bME.s.3">We decided that buttons for controls of channels and volume should be bigger and that additional buttons should be availible in a "hidden" pull-out format during the technical segment.</sent> <sent nite:id="ES2008bME.s.4">During the working design, we learned about the importance of infrared and high-quality chips and batteries.</sent> <sent nite:id="ES2008bME.s.5">We ended by deciding that defining our target based on demographic might be difficult and that we'd be better off doing it by what the consumer wants it to look and feel like.</sent>
