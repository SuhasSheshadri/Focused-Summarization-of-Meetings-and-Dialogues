   <sent nite:id="ES2002cME.s.1">During this third meeting of our design team we set ourselves to the task of using reports from each team member to make decisions on the design concept for the next stages of planning.</sent>  <sent nite:id="ES2002cME.s.2">The information brought to the meeting included market trend research, available cosmetic features for the unit and a specific user interface proposal.</sent>     <sent nite:id="ES2002cME.s.3">The challenge during this meeting was to begin incorporating as many of the production goals as possible in one concept.</sent>  <sent nite:id="ES2002cME.s.4">The decisions made were done in great haste as time was limited.</sent>  <sent nite:id="ES2002cME.s.5">We settled on a design using an "8" shape, with a jog-dial for channel selection, a concealed audio control compartment, lemon-lime colour scheme and backlighting.</sent>  <sent nite:id="ES2002cME.s.6">It was also decided that if possible, the unit would be kinetic powered.</sent>  <sent nite:id="ES2002cME.s.7">My feeling is that not enough time or focus was spent developing the two top design priorities: fashionable look-and-feel,  and high-tech innovation.</sent>
