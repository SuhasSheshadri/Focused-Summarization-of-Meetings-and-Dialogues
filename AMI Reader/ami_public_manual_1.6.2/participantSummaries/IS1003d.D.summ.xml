<sent nite:id="IS1003dME.s.1">A presentation of the remote control prototype has been made by Baba and
David.</sent> <sent nite:id="IS1003dME.s.2">It is mainly based on a rotating yellow ball (lemon like?) to zap
between channels with a coarse-to-fine strategy.</sent> <sent nite:id="IS1003dME.s.3">A base with solar cells
reloads the device.</sent> <sent nite:id="IS1003dME.s.4">I conducted an evaluation of the prototype based on
three criteria: (i) Fancy Look and Feel, (ii) Technologically Innovative,
(iii) Easy to use.</sent> <sent nite:id="IS1003dME.s.5">This evaluation gave a good score to the solution (mean
of 3 on a 1 to 7 scale, 1 being 'yes').</sent> <sent nite:id="IS1003dME.s.6">The main point of this meeting was
a necessary redesign of the solution to reach the 12.50 Euros cost goal.</sent>
