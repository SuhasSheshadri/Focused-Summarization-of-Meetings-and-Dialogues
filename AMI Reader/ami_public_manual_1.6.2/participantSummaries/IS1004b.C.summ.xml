<sent nite:id="IS1004bID.s.1">I am going to find out what components are required for the remote control
in the present setup.</sent> <sent nite:id="IS1004bID.s.2">We want to have a remote control with the following
interfaces:
1.</sent> <sent nite:id="IS1004bID.s.3">Buttons (for traditional user)
2.</sent> <sent nite:id="IS1004bID.s.4">Scroller (for young and technical savvy customers).</sent>
<sent nite:id="IS1004bID.s.5">3.</sent> <sent nite:id="IS1004bID.s.6">Might be LCD screen (for customers with high income.</sent> <sent nite:id="IS1004bID.s.7">But it still needs
   to be checked).</sent>
<sent nite:id="IS1004bID.s.8">4.</sent> <sent nite:id="IS1004bID.s.9">A finder alarm device (to find the remote if it is misplaced).</sent> <sent nite:id="IS1004bID.s.10">Also, the components required for the remote are:
1.</sent> <sent nite:id="IS1004bID.s.11">Infrared rays emitter
2.</sent> <sent nite:id="IS1004bID.s.12">Programming device to program infrared rays emitter
3.</sent> <sent nite:id="IS1004bID.s.13">Power Management of the remote
4.</sent> <sent nite:id="IS1004bID.s.14">Interface for tele-text control (some extra button or scroller itself)
5.</sent> <sent nite:id="IS1004bID.s.15">Safety aspects
6.</sent> <sent nite:id="IS1004bID.s.16">Durability (against shock due to falling, water resistance)
7.</sent> <sent nite:id="IS1004bID.s.17">Performance measures (distance and angle) of the remote from the TV</sent>

<sent nite:id="IS1004bID.s.18">There is a possibility of scroll based user interface.</sent> <sent nite:id="IS1004bID.s.19">LCD interface is not
possible because of cost problem.</sent> <sent nite:id="IS1004bID.s.20">ASR interface has been dropped out

<sent nite:id="IS1004bID.s.26">In the meeting we discussed what kind of remote will be good.</sent> <sent nite:id="IS1004bID.s.27">We worked on
the interfaces we can use.</sent> <sent nite:id="IS1004bID.s.28">Design issues were also discussed.</sent> <sent nite:id="IS1004bID.s.29">We might go
for LCD interface (but costs are prohibitive).</sent> <sent nite:id="IS1004bID.s.30">ASR interface has been ruled
out.</sent>
