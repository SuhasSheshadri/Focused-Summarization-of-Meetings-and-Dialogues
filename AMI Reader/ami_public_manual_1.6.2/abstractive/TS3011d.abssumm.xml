<sentence nite:id="TS3011d.vkaraisk.s.1">The UI and ID presented a prototype drawing of the remote control design.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3011d.vkaraisk.s.2">It can be used as a normal remote, but the speech recognition also provides a more advanced alternative interface.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3011d.vkaraisk.s.3">The speech recognition works as a finding mechanism as well.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3011d.vkaraisk.s.4">The rubber case is yellow with grey or black, with buttons either made of plastic or rubber.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3011d.vkaraisk.s.5">An extra button could activate/deactivate the voice recognition.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3011d.vkaraisk.s.6">The prototype proved extremely over budget.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3011d.vkaraisk.s.7">The main contributing factors were the solar cell and speech recognition.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3011d.vkaraisk.s.8">One way to compensate for the loss of features, but still attract their target group, would be to add more colour to the design.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3011d.vkaraisk.s.9">After the costing, the original prototype was evaluated on a scale of 1(excellent)-7(very bad).</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3011d.vkaraisk.s.10">The criteria used were fancifulness (2), technological innovation (2), ease of use (2.5), whether it is easy to find (1), sponginess (1.5), number of features (1).</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3011d.vkaraisk.s.11">Finally, the team evaluated the project process in terms of creativity (choices too narrow), leadership and teamwork (happy with it, but they missed communicating in between meetings), and means (SMARTboard was not satisfactory, but the digital pens were alright, but not too useful).</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3011d.vkaraisk.s.12">The delay in providing costs of components was criticised.</sentence>

<sentence nite:id="TS3011d.vkaraisk.s.13">The prototype will have to be redesigned, so that it is compatible with the budget constraints..</sentence>

<decisions nite:id="TS3011d.vkaraisk.decisions.1">
<sentence nite:id="TS3011d.vkaraisk.s.14">The idea to include a solar cell as a power source had to be abandoned, due to the escalated costs.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3011d.vkaraisk.s.15">The same happened with the speech recognition.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3011d.vkaraisk.s.16">In order for the cost to come down to the original budget of 12.50, they also had to replace the rubber of the buttons with plastic and not use a curved design.</sentence>

<sentence nite:id="TS3011d.vkaraisk.s.17">The prototype proved extremely over budget.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3011d.vkaraisk.s.18">It would cost 22 euros.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3011d.vkaraisk.s.19">The team thought all the changes to accommodate the budget requirements made a very dull device.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3011d.vkaraisk.s.20">It was suggested that they go for a completely simple design so as to maximise the profit, although this was not what was asked in the project requirements.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3011d.vkaraisk.s.21">The device cannot be a hi-tech, innovative one any more.</sentence>
