<sentence nite:id="TS3012b.vkaraisk.s.1">Customers are willing to pay more for fancier looking remotes.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3012b.vkaraisk.s.2">They like innovative technology like speech recognition and LCD screens.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3012b.vkaraisk.s.3">It also transpires that remotes are easy to lose.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3012b.vkaraisk.s.4">Everyone agreed that they need to incorporate a locating mechanism in their design, and that changeable covers could make appealing-looking remotes.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3012b.vkaraisk.s.5">The need for clarity of button functions was mentioned.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3012b.vkaraisk.s.6">On the other hand, materials should be more durable.</sentence>  <sentence nite:id="TS3012b.vkaraisk.s.7">The function of the remote is relatively simple: by pressing a button a current is passed to the chip, and defines what signal is to be sent to the receiver (the TV) via infrared.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3012b.vkaraisk.s.8">There are some new requirements: the target group will be people below 40, the device will have to be for TV only, they should ignore the teletext function, and, also, the remote should be recognisable as a Real Reaction product.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3012b.vkaraisk.s.9">They drew some of their ideas, and discussed the positioning of the buttons and the LCD.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3012b.vkaraisk.s.10">The most used buttons are going to be placed on top.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3012b.vkaraisk.s.11">It might be possible to use a charger for the remote.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3012b.vkaraisk.s.12">The concept of the design will be finalised in the next meeting.</sentence>

<sentence nite:id="TS3012b.vkaraisk.s.20">The target group will be people below 40.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3012b.vkaraisk.s.21">The remote will only be used for TV.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3012b.vkaraisk.s.22">The company colours and slogan will have to be shown on the device.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3012b.vkaraisk.s.23">Buttons should be made bigger, with clearly defined functions and of durable materials to avoid fading of the symbols.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3012b.vkaraisk.s.24">It would be a good idea to integrate a mechanism for finding the remote control, when the user loses it.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3012b.vkaraisk.s.25">A button that sticks on the TV could be pressed to make the lost remote beep, and perhaps also light up.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3012b.vkaraisk.s.26">The remote is going to be a universal one.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3012b.vkaraisk.s.27">Because symbols may fade, the additional covers could include those.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3012b.vkaraisk.s.28">The remote will need to be different from those available in the market in terms of shape and colour.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3012b.vkaraisk.s.29">The important buttons will be on top.</sentence>

<problems nite:id="TS3012b.vkaraisk.problems.1">
<sentence nite:id="TS3012b.vkaraisk.s.30">Speech recognition and LCD screens could be added to the remote control, but they might be too expensive for this project.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3012b.vkaraisk.s.31">The industrial designer wondered whether the remote should be universal or programmable.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3012b.vkaraisk.s.32">Symbols on remotes fade with time.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3012b.vkaraisk.s.33">It may not be technically possible for a universal remote control to create menus for various advanced settings on the TV itself.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3012b.vkaraisk.s.34">Different TVs have different functions incorporated in their built-in menus, making it hard to know in advance which buttons you can do without on the remote.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3012b.vkaraisk.s.35">It is difficult to organise or limit the number of buttons in a way that makes the remote easier to use.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3012b.vkaraisk.s.36">The team also discussed extensively the positioning of various buttons.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3012b.vkaraisk.s.37">Using a charger for the remote may be too expensive.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3012b.vkaraisk.s.38">Consumers claim they would pay more for a remote with LCD screen, but adding the component might be too expensive.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3012b.vkaraisk.s.39">In the case where it is added, the issue would be whether to place it at the top or the bottom of the remote.</sentence>
