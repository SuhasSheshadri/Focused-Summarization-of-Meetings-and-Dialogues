<sentence nite:id="TS3012c.vkaraisk.s.1">For the conceptual design, the ID suggested to use kinetic dynamo as energy source.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3012c.vkaraisk.s.2">The decision veered towards the basic battery option with no recharging station.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3012c.vkaraisk.s.3">They also decided to go for a single-curved design.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3012c.vkaraisk.s.4">The available materials for the casing are plastic, wood, rubber and titanium.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3012c.vkaraisk.s.5">Possible interfaces are push buttons, scroll wheels, and LCDs. The inclusion of advanced features, like LCD screen and speech recognition, can only be speculative, because the team have no pricing information.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3012c.vkaraisk.s.6">The UI presented two provisional designs, standard and luxury.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3012c.vkaraisk.s.7">The latter has an LCD screen at the top.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3012c.vkaraisk.s.8">They are both rectangular with a curve grooved in where the finger rests.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3012c.vkaraisk.s.9">There are two lights to help find the remote, all the standard buttons and speech recognition.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3012c.vkaraisk.s.10">The marketing expert talked about the public's preference for looks over technological innovation; however, they both seem to be more important than ease of use.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3012c.vkaraisk.s.11">The current fashion among younger people favours bright colours and fruit and vegetable themes and spongy materials: pertinent exchangeable fronts can express such trends on the remote.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3012c.vkaraisk.s.12">Based on the UI's drawing, they designed another version shaped slightly like a banana, and discussed the positions of buttons and all other components.</sentence>

<problems nite:id="TS3012c.vkaraisk.problems.1">
<sentence nite:id="TS3012c.vkaraisk.s.25">There were doubts whether a kinetic dynamo can offer enough energy, especially if an LCD is added to the remote.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3012c.vkaraisk.s.26">The usefulness of scroll-wheels for such a device is debatable, as they can probably only be used for volume control, but they would not be appropriate for zapping.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3012c.vkaraisk.s.27">The inclusion of advanced features like LCD screen and speech recognition can only be speculative, because the team have no pricing information at this point.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3012c.vkaraisk.s.28">The rectangular general form suggested in the design could be at odds with the current trends of natural themes.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3012c.vkaraisk.s.29">On the other hand, such trends are very transient.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3012c.vkaraisk.s.30">The use of the sample speaker and sample sensor and whether they allow the device to create sounds were not entirely clear.</sentence>
