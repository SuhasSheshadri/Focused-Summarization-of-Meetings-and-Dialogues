<abstract nite:id="ES2014d.vkaraisk.abstract.1">
<sentence nite:id="ES2014d.vkaraisk.s.1">The first prototype for the remote control was made of single-curved rubber with a total of 16 rubber buttons (some of them in a slide-out panel) with a cherry design on top.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="ES2014d.vkaraisk.s.2">It uses kinetic energy and has a sample sensor for the speech recognition.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="ES2014d.vkaraisk.s.3">The initial cost was calculated at 13.70 Euros.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="ES2014d.vkaraisk.s.4">Although over budget, the team decided to evaluate this prototype before making any changes.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="ES2014d.vkaraisk.s.5">On a scale from 1 (true) to 7 (false) they rated it on the basis of the following criteria: fancy design (2), technological innovation (2), ease of use (1), incorporation of fashion elements (2), and brand recognition (2).</sentence> <sentence nite:id="ES2014d.vkaraisk.s.6">Changing the rubber case to plastic reduced the cost and allowed for an extra button-form and colour.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="ES2014d.vkaraisk.s.7">The team were reasonably satisfied with the project in terms of teamwork and creativity, although they thought that the flow of information was sometimes disjointed.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="ES2014d.vkaraisk.s.8">However, the idea of designing a remote control seemed unexciting, especially since the requirements restricted it to TV only, and the budget was too small.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="ES2014d.vkaraisk.s.9">Finally, some new ideas were also found in the form of kinetic energy source and use of speech recognition.</sentence>

<sentence nite:id="ES2014d.vkaraisk.s.11">The remote will be single-curved with a cherry design on top.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="ES2014d.vkaraisk.s.12">The case will be made of plastic.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="ES2014d.vkaraisk.s.13">The buttons will be made of rubber mostly in a light blue colour.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="ES2014d.vkaraisk.s.14">However, volume and channel buttons will be different from the rest.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="ES2014d.vkaraisk.s.15">Volume buttons will be lemon-shaped and coloured.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="ES2014d.vkaraisk.s.16">A slide-out panel with extra buttons for less-used functions is included.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="ES2014d.vkaraisk.s.17">The buttons in this panel will all be in the standard blue colour.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="ES2014d.vkaraisk.s.18">A simple chip is going to support the electronics of the device.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="ES2014d.vkaraisk.s.19">A sample sensor was included to add speech recognition.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="ES2014d.vkaraisk.s.20">The remote is going to be powered by kinetic energy.</sentence>

<problems nite:id="ES2014d.vkaraisk.problems.1">
<sentence nite:id="ES2014d.vkaraisk.s.21">After changing the case material from rubber to plastic, it was debated that the loss of sponginess does affect the fancy appeal and trendiness of the remote.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="ES2014d.vkaraisk.s.22">On the other hand, it was argued that the special colours and form compensated for that.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="ES2014d.vkaraisk.s.23">The team were not certain to what extent the prototype satisfied recognisability of the corporate identity.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="ES2014d.vkaraisk.s.24">They were not certain what the colour of the company logo should be and how the logo should be displayed.</sentence>
