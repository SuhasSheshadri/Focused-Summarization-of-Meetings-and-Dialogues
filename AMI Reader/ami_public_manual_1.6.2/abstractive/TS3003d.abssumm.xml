<abstract nite:id="TS3003d.vkaraisk.abstract.1">
<sentence nite:id="TS3003d.vkaraisk.s.1">In the detailed design meeting the team created a prototype.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3003d.vkaraisk.s.2">Along with buttons for numbers, channel selector, volume, mute, on-off, teletext, and subtitles, the prototype included an LCD screen and a help button for functional information.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3003d.vkaraisk.s.3">One rechargable battery, single-curve form and plastic case, brought the total cost to 17 Euros.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3003d.vkaraisk.s.4">To reduce this cost, it was decided to replace most buttons with a scrollwheel.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3003d.vkaraisk.s.5">The remaining buttons were one for channel selection, one for volume (both assisted by the scrollwheel), teletext, on-off and the help button.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3003d.vkaraisk.s.6">A suggestion to target the product to a younger or perhaps more general group was met with approval.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3003d.vkaraisk.s.7">All these components were re-arranged in a revised prototype.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3003d.vkaraisk.s.8">It was evaluated on a scale from 1 to 7 on the basis of the following criteria: fancy design (6), technological innovation (4), functionality (7), consideration of the target group (3).</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3003d.vkaraisk.s.9">The remote was also recognisable as a fashionable Real Reaction product.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3003d.vkaraisk.s.10">The project process was deemed well-structured, although everyone thought it would have been better had they known the component prices at an earlier stage.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3003d.vkaraisk.s.11">Teamword and leadership were good, but room for creativity impeded by budget constraints.</sentence>

<decisions nite:id="TS3003d.vkaraisk.decisions.1">
<sentence nite:id="TS3003d.vkaraisk.s.13">The prototype will use a rechargable battery.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3003d.vkaraisk.s.14">The case will be plastic and will be made in single-curve form.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3003d.vkaraisk.s.15">Five buttons are going to be used: one for channel selection, one for volume (both assisted by the scrollwheel), teletext, on-off and help button.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3003d.vkaraisk.s.16">These would be made of rubber in a colour different from that of the case.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3003d.vkaraisk.s.17">Their functionality will be enriched by the use of a scrollwheel (going up or down the channel list, changing the volume, etc.).</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3003d.vkaraisk.s.18">Standard buttons like the ones for teletext shortcuts were considered superfluous.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3003d.vkaraisk.s.19">An LCD screen will be providing functional information, and context tips when using the scrollwheel.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3003d.vkaraisk.s.20">The revised prototype will probably be targeted to a younger one, or even across the population.</sentence>

</decisions>
<problems nite:id="TS3003d.vkaraisk.problems.1">
<sentence nite:id="TS3003d.vkaraisk.s.21">The final cost of the prototype was probably slightly over the specified 12.50 Euros.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3003d.vkaraisk.s.22">Raising the budget was not an option, although it was promoted as an idea throughout the meeting.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3003d.vkaraisk.s.23">It is not clear whether the budget will allow for a docking station to be produced along with the remote, as it isn't included in the costing sheet.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3003d.vkaraisk.s.24">The non-standard interface (few buttons, scrollwheel) makes the remote unsuitable for older people - the original target group.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3003d.vkaraisk.s.25">It was suspected that many would not know how to use a scrollwheel, even though it does resemble a radio tuning button.</sentence>
