      "so then we can look at th at the agenda for this meeting .\n",
      "Well in we will just have a look at the at the notes from the previous meeting , what we thought we had dec decided .\n",
      "then we will look at the three presentations from you .\n",
      "we will look at th the new project requirements\n",
      "and I will have a look if\n",
      "Well I think we should show them before your presentations ,\n",
      "Well then we can make some decisions about our remote control functions .\n",
      "We have to deb we have to decide it in this meeting what our function will be .\n",
      "And then we can discuss some more closely .\n",
      "now I will look at show this board .\n",
      "We should make it compatible with our new DVD and other releases we have , our technical releases .\n",
      "not too many one buttons .\n",
      "now the new project requirements , I will just show them .\n",
      "Maybe a new sort of thing , but n but not teletext .\n",
      "But let is forget about it .\n",
      "so we have to go on .\n",
      "So we have to use maybe a slogan , maybe a colour , and\n",
      "So maybe that is a slogan we can put somewhere on our remote control or something .\n",
      "You want to start ?\n",
      "I think I have to start .\n",
      "Well s then start .\n",
      "Well , I am going to tell you something about functional requirements .\n",
      "to start with these points .\n",
      "next sheet ?\n",
      "at first I tell you something about what people dislike about the current controls ,\n",
      "then I tell something about the most important issues .\n",
      "So we have to focus on those three thing three things .\n",
      "And in the end I will show you our target audience or our target product users , customers .\n",
      "so we might think about fronts in that section .\n",
      "So it is very important that you design a a nice looking control .\n",
      "So it is really important to make the the buttons for the common tasks kind of big or kind of flashy .\n",
      "Thus it might be might be smart to make a a big zapping button or something in the middle , so you can reach it with your thumb .\n",
      "You can zap away .\n",
      "So it might be sensible to make some kind of a button on your television , that is your your control beeps or something , that you can find this very easily .\n",
      "It should actually It should actually be loose from the television ,\n",
      "Well we will have a look at it , yeah .\n",
      "I think our user expert should also consider manual a manual for the remote , of course .\n",
      "I think you should put more time in the in the design of pick up and use , than a manual .\n",
      "you should You should could take a look at it and and and know how it how it is supposed to work .\n",
      "Well maybe for the If you do not recognise a button who d who d who do I call wh when I do not know it ?\n",
      "It sh it should be there , the manual .\n",
      "So it is better to put our attention to the the design .\n",
      "we can say to some writer make a manual point .\n",
      "Well we will have a look .\n",
      "Next point .\n",
      "If we make lots of of the stuff , maybe we can buy it very cheap , I dunno .\n",
      "Well we will consider it .\n",
      "Yeah well it is your your task to look into the costs of those\n",
      "No , we will look we will look into that later .\n",
      "Well we will consider both and and see what what what we can find , I think .\n",
      "I think it is sensible to u to take this take these points into the notes .\n",
      "Shall I give a technical talk ?\n",
      "Well go ahead .\n",
      "Okay , how do you enlarge it , so that you can have the\n",
      "And I then can select I can select on the dings\n",
      "Maybe you can select it .\n",
      "Click .\n",
      "Yeah , go ahead .\n",
      "if you have the most used buttons all in one place , and you keep making the same well moves .\n",
      "So we have to change a little bit to that ,\n",
      "Can I say something ?\n",
      "But I think it is very important to make the power , channel and volume buttons near to the thumb , so you ca not have RSI consequences .\n",
      "Make them big , make them easy to to press .\n",
      "Maybe you can make , for for channel changing , two little buttons on the side of the remote , so you can just do like this .\n",
      "but the most important buttons m maybe you can just put them a bit apart\n",
      "you can make make a double feature l like a button on the top and under it .\n",
      "Like some little Gameboy things or some\n",
      "but if you s say them up and down\n",
      "Right , continue .\n",
      "But in e in any case the the basic function should be indeed , and as you say at the thumb .\n",
      "and and that the less important buttons , like the the the different channels , the numbers one\n",
      "Then Mike can give the third presentation .\n",
      "so But we do have to come to a decision , right later on .\n",
      "Well , I thought that we reduce the the option to control the DVD also , and teletext and that kind of stuff .\n",
      "I think we should go further with the idea of a removable front .\n",
      "So we can can yeah customise the\n",
      "but i th they all have to have something about the recognition from our company .\n",
      "Or you can you can can put the same symbol on on every remote .\n",
      "We can put it on the on the back side .\n",
      "But let is not focus on the front .\n",
      "Like eject we do not need , and some other buttons we do not need .\n",
      "Yeah , I will .\n",
      "Mike , can you put that picture from me on the in the Word documents file ?\n",
      "We should go with that concept I think .\n",
      "I have I have got another point .\n",
      "So we must must design a control that really speaks to the people .\n",
      "Here , look at these numbers .\n",
      "It it could be such a little th that you can click in and out and you and you have it .\n",
      "we should keep that simple too .\n",
      "or or just integrate inside to try to make it d more trendy .\n",
      "something like on some radios in car .\n",
      "just at at the top .\n",
      "I think it should be at the top .\n",
      "RDSs or something .\n",
      "but we are we will have to look into that .\n",
      "we can use this board again , I think .\n",
      "we can put some decisions about the controls we want , th the issue .\n",
      "We should have a general idea of how it is going to look .\n",
      "So we have to decide on the different remote control functions .\n",
      "Should not we start with the most important parts ?\n",
      "but we should start with the power button ?\n",
      "Maybe we should centralise the discussion here .\n",
      "We will draw two , and then we will see\n",
      "But you just can put the the the the the whole interface a bit down ,\n",
      "We do not want them to look like a calculator .\n",
      "Maybe a bic better white We White ?\n",
      "but you do not have to throw important aspe important aspect like familiarity completely away ,\n",
      "It it needs to be calibrated again .\n",
      "Well let is talk about that later\n",
      "Alright , we have to make a decision now , because we do not have much time .\n",
      "Maybe you should another pen .\n",
      "I think it should be at the button , bottom .\n",
      "Well but what what if we we first decide the different functions , and then look at the design .\n",
      "yeah we should summon the the different aspects of the thing .\n",
      "And moreover I think that you two should be come to consensus about the LCD s .\n",
      "Alright , let is keep it central .\n",
      "I think we we should use something like this to The the channel up and channel down button ?\n",
      "Well let is look at your design .\n",
      "as I already said , we could drop some of these buttons .\n",
      "You should put that power button , channel and volume should have the most importance .\n",
      "I think these should be in one big circle in the middle .\n",
      "So it might be smarter to put them a little more away from each other .\n",
      "They they need to be centred .\n",
      "So the the channel channel buttons should be far far apart , I think , up and down .\n",
      "Y look at look at the frequency .\n",
      "And should and should be red .\n",
      "Right , just make some decisions .\n",
      "how are we going to do it with those numbers ?\n",
      "We can use the drawing board now , I think .\n",
      "Just you decide that , you decide that ,\n",
      "Well what if we are going to now decide about the functions , and the design comes into the next round ?\n",
      "You can make it wider and less wide .\n",
      "And the button that you can go to AV for your video .\n",
      "I do think we have to put that underneath a clip .\n",
      "But you you can put two or three buttons under another section .\n",
      "We we can make make a little row of like four buttons down here .\n",
      "Or at the top .\n",
      "You can just put it somewhere\n",
      "Well and and I think more at the bottom .\n",
      "you have one one button from s set frequency o or something , and then with plus and min\n",
      "And and the settings to change the brightness the settings to change the brightness and the contrast .\n",
      "I think things like contrast and brightness should be in the menu ,\n",
      "Or the volume or something like that .\n",
      "We are going to go to our rooms , and we will have to decide s things on our own I think .\n",
