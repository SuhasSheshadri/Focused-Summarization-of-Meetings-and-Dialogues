<abstract nite:id="TS3011c.vkaraisk.abstract.1">
<sentence nite:id="TS3011c.vkaraisk.s.1">For the conceptual design, the marketing expert talked about the public's preference for looks over technological innovation; however, they both seem to be more important than ease of use.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3011c.vkaraisk.s.2">The current fashion among younger people favours bright colours and fruit and vegetable themes and spongy materials: pertinent exchangeable fronts can express such trends on the remote, and could also provide themes for other target groups.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3011c.vkaraisk.s.3">They could also add some rubber to provide easy grip of the device.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3011c.vkaraisk.s.4">Cases can be flat, single- or double-curved.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3011c.vkaraisk.s.5">They can be made of plastic, rubber, wood or titanium.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3011c.vkaraisk.s.6">Hand or kinetic dynamos, batteries, and solar cells can be used as energy sources.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3011c.vkaraisk.s.7">Possible interfaces are push buttons, scroll wheels, and LCDs. A way to make this device different would be to use a scroll-wheel on the side with integrated button for volume control and mute.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3011c.vkaraisk.s.8">Speech recognition can be implemented by adding a sample sensor and speaker on the remote.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3011c.vkaraisk.s.9">The final decisions also included combined battery with solar cells.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3011c.vkaraisk.s.10">The team will design a single-curved device with a scroll wheel and speech recognition, in black and yellow, the company colours.</sentence>

<sentence nite:id="TS3011c.vkaraisk.s.11">The industrial designer and the user interface designer will work on a drawing of a prototype.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3011c.vkaraisk.s.12">They will think about ways to make their product different from the others in the market.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3011c.vkaraisk.s.13">They will also try to find a way to promote the corporate identity in the design of the look and feel and interface.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3011c.vkaraisk.s.14">The ID and UI will also have to figure out whether to use rubber just for the buttons and side finish, or for the whole front of the remote.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3011c.vkaraisk.s.15">The marketing expert will carry out a product evaluation.</sentence>

<decisions nite:id="TS3011c.vkaraisk.decisions.1">
<sentence nite:id="TS3011c.vkaraisk.s.16">Changeable covers for the remote control can link the product to current fashion trends, but also trends followed by other age groups.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3011c.vkaraisk.s.17">A scroll wheel will be included in the design.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3011c.vkaraisk.s.18">A regular chip will be needed for this.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3011c.vkaraisk.s.19">A single-curved rubber casing can also be used.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3011c.vkaraisk.s.20">LCD is not going to be implemented.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3011c.vkaraisk.s.21">The preferred energy source was a combination of batteries and solar cells.</sentence>

<problems nite:id="TS3011c.vkaraisk.problems.1">
<sentence nite:id="TS3011c.vkaraisk.s.22">It is not clear whether a kinetic dynamo can be used, because it is unlikely that a user shakes the remote enough, as one would do with similarly powered watches.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3011c.vkaraisk.s.23">The use of a scroll wheel with integrated button was debated, as not everyone was convinced of its use for this project.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3011c.vkaraisk.s.24">Using the speech recognition on the device may not be convenient, since the remote will have to pointing towards the TV at the same time for the infrared to work.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3011c.vkaraisk.s.25">LCD screens may add an extra hi-tech touch, but given all the other features, it might be too much.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3011c.vkaraisk.s.26">The company colours (grey and yellow and black) did not seem sufficiently bright and trendy to everyone.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3011c.vkaraisk.s.27">Printing an image on the remote to make it more colourful is doable, but cannot be done by the manufacturing department.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3011c.vkaraisk.s.28">The front could have a rubber finish, or the buttons will be made of rubber.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3011c.vkaraisk.s.29">It was debated that customers may prefer a total spongy texture, not just in the buttons and the sides of the remote.</sentence>
