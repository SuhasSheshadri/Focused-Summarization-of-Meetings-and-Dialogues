<actions nite:id="ES2009c.JacquelinePalmer.actions.1">

<sentence nite:id="ES2009c.JacquelinePalmer.s.12">The Industrial Designer, the User Interface Designer, and the Marketing Expert were instructed to work together on making the prototype of the remote control.</sentence> 
<sentence nite:id="ES2009c.JacquelinePalmer.s.13">The Industrial Designer will build the look of the device using the new manufacturing constraints that were presented.</sentence>
<sentence nite:id="ES2009c.JacquelinePalmer.s.14">The User Interface Designer was assigned the task of making the design layout of the device.</sentence>
<sentence nite:id="ES2009c.JacquelinePalmer.s.15">The Marketing Expert was instructed to check the evaluations of the prototype.</sentence>

<decisions nite:id="ES2009c.JacquelinePalmer.decisions.1">

<sentence nite:id="ES2009c.JacquelinePalmer.s.16">The group realized that it would be too costly to add both a voice recognition component and a touch screen, so they decided between the two and will now only add the voice recognition component.</sentence>
<sentence nite:id="ES2009c.JacquelinePalmer.s.17">The group decided to have optional alternative cases for the device to suit different consumer tastes.</sentence>
<sentence nite:id="ES2009c.JacquelinePalmer.s.18">It was also decided that the remote will not have the traditional look of a hand-held remote since it can be stationary with voice recognition software.</sentence> 
<sentence nite:id="ES2009c.JacquelinePalmer.s.19">The remote control will be made of a soft rubber material.</sentence>
<sentence nite:id="ES2009c.JacquelinePalmer.s.20">The device will be powered by solar power, with a small backup battery.</sentence> 
</decisions>
<problems nite:id="ES2009c.JacquelinePalmer.problems.1">

<sentence nite:id="ES2009c.JacquelinePalmer.s.21">There were difficulties deciding between adding extra features and staying within the project budget.</sentence> 
<sentence nite:id="ES2009c.JacquelinePalmer.s.22">The participants had problems projecting how much each added feature would drive up the price point of the device because there was a lack of data on manufacturing cost.</sentence>
