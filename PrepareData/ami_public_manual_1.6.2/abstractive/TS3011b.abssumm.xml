<sentence nite:id="TS3011b.vkaraisk.s.1">There are some new requirements for the project: the device will have to be for TV only, they should ignore the teletext function, as it is dated, and, also, the remote should be recognisable as a Real Reaction product.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3011b.vkaraisk.s.2">The target group will be people below 40.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3011b.vkaraisk.s.3">The UI preferred an easy-to-use remote to a multi-function one.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3011b.vkaraisk.s.4">The function of the remote is relatively simple: by pressing a button a current is passed to the chip, and defines what signal is to be sent to the receiver (the TV) via infrared.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3011b.vkaraisk.s.5">The use of infrared, energy-efficient power source and cheap circuit was suggested.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3011b.vkaraisk.s.6">The remote could light up via LED's placed inside.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3011b.vkaraisk.s.7">Functions like zapping are very prevalent, as well as complaints about remotes being easy to lose.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3011b.vkaraisk.s.8">It also transpires that customers like innovative technology like speech recognition.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3011b.vkaraisk.s.9">The design can focus on such customer needs, like finding a mechanism to locate a lost remote.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3011b.vkaraisk.s.10">The functions of the remote will include a back button to switch between two channels, volume, program selection, and speech recognition, with a focus on simplicity of design.</sentence>

<sentence nite:id="TS3011b.vkaraisk.s.16">LED's can be used to light up the remote.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3011b.vkaraisk.s.17">Using them sparsely, as in mobile phones, could bring down the cost.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3011b.vkaraisk.s.18">It would be a good idea to integrate a mechanism for finding the remote control, when the user loses it.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3011b.vkaraisk.s.19">The latter would be preferable to implementing a backlight into the remote.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3011b.vkaraisk.s.20">A single, large, round button can be used for both volume and channel selection by using the four separate quadrants.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3011b.vkaraisk.s.21">Another button to switch between two channels could also be implemented.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3011b.vkaraisk.s.22">The remote will also include volume and program selection, and speech recognition.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="TS3011b.vkaraisk.s.23">A recharging cradle can be added to compensate for the extra energy consumption.</sentence>
