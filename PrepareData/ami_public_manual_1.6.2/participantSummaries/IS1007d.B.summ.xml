<participant_decisions nite:id="IS1007dUI.pdecisions.1">
<sent nite:id="IS1007dUI.s.17">We decided not to produce the LCD version because the display can be
transferred to the TV screen; this gives more space and fanciful display
than the LCD.</sent> <sent nite:id="IS1007dUI.s.18">We also decided that different kinds of "skin" can be used on the new
prototype.</sent> <sent nite:id="IS1007dUI.s.19">In particular, fruits and vegetable skins are fashionable,
according to the marketing manager.</sent>
