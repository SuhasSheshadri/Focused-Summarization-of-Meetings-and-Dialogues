   <sent nite:id="ES2016cME.s.1">In our third meeting, as before, we went around the table and gave our individual power point presentations.</sent>  <sent nite:id="ES2016cME.s.2">I had even less information to report on this time, but some of my contributions had a significant impact on our final design decision.</sent>  <sent nite:id="ES2016cME.s.3">Manuel seemed to contribute the most, as his reports on the interior and exterior of the design (materials, energy source options, etc) were very crucial to our ultimate conclusions.</sent>  <sent nite:id="ES2016cME.s.4">We ended by summarizing what we have all agreed on (I hope we are all clear on all of the specific criteria), and it is now almost time for the designers to construct our banana-shaped remote out of clay.</sent>
