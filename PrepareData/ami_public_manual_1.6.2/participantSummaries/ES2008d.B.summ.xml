    <sent nite:id="ES2008dID.s.1">In this final meeting we presented our three prototypes to the rest of the group, discussed benefits and drawbacks for each one, and decided to go with design number 2, the mango.</sent> <sent nite:id="ES2008dID.s.2">This will be produced in a rubber cover, with 6 push buttons and an ergonomic shape.</sent> <sent nite:id="ES2008dID.s.3">It will have a kinetic battery.</sent> <sent nite:id="ES2008dID.s.4">We then analysed how closely the final decision matched our original design and economic goals.</sent> <sent nite:id="ES2008dID.s.5">We are fairly satisfied that we fulfilled our dual objectives of simplicity and fashion, and that the 'mango' will be a successful product with wideranging appeal, and a considerable profit margin.</sent>
