    <sent nite:id="ES2006dUI.s.1">In this meeting we discussed the final disain issues, and evaluated the prototype.</sent> <sent nite:id="ES2006dUI.s.2">Then we calculated the production costs.</sent> <sent nite:id="ES2006dUI.s.3">It turned out that the estimated production costs were over the budject.</sent> <sent nite:id="ES2006dUI.s.4">Therefore, we had to slightly simplify the design, and removed some of the advanced, but non too necessary features - scroll button and the voice sampler.</sent> <sent nite:id="ES2006dUI.s.5">Since the voice sampler was also ment to be used when locating the remote control, we had to provide an alternative solution.</sent> <sent nite:id="ES2006dUI.s.6">We decided that it would just beep when the locator button that can be attched to the TV (or anywhere else for that matter) is pressed.</sent> <sent nite:id="ES2006dUI.s.7">The whole group was very satisfied with the design of the prototype.</sent> <sent nite:id="ES2006dUI.s.8">We expect the product to be great success.</sent>
