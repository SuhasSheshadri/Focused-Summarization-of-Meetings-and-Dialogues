    <sent nite:id="ES2016bME.s.1">During our second meeting, we each gave a power point presentation, reporting on research findings and in my case, statistics from a survey that was taken by 100 users.</sent> <sent nite:id="ES2016bME.s.2">A lot of time was spent at the end, still trying to come up with a design that is both functional (our main concern) and aesthetically appealing.</sent> <sent nite:id="ES2016bME.s.3">From a marketing view point, I didn't have tons to contribute except for sharing my report findings, which have hopefully made us think more about which audience group to target.</sent>  <sent nite:id="ES2016bME.s.4">We were also given three more pieces of modified criteria to consider for our project.</sent>
