<sent nite:id="IS1007aUI.s.1">Concerned with the overall product design.</sent> <sent nite:id="IS1007aUI.s.2">The last meeting was more
concerned with the functional design aspect.</sent> <sent nite:id="IS1007aUI.s.3">It was concluded that a TV
remote-controller should give the user the flexibility to choose either by
content or by channel.</sent> <sent nite:id="IS1007aUI.s.4">The conventional TV remote-controller gives only the
option by channel and not by content.</sent> <sent nite:id="IS1007aUI.s.5">Hence, our new design is
revolutionary in that it can give the user to option of choosing by
channel.</sent> <sent nite:id="IS1007aUI.s.6">This poses a great challenge: how to implement that?</sent> <sent nite:id="IS1007aUI.s.7">One option is
by retrieving XML files from a TV program website provider.</sent>
