A 37.38 Okay . ami_da_2
A 38.18 door is closed . ami_da_4
A 41.71 Well , let is begin . ami_da_6
A 43.5 Because if we have as much time as the last meeting , we will have to hurry up . ami_da_4
D 43.59 I am listening . ami_da_9
D 46.59 Right . ami_da_9
A 49.25 well I will start with the presentation again , the agenda . ami_da_7
D 51.57 Great . ami_da_9
A 57.51 Yo . ami_da_16
A 62.15 So . ami_da_2
A 64.97 This one I think . ami_da_4
A 69.19 yeah . ami_da_9
A 71.83 Well alright . ami_da_2
A 73.82 well , I will show you the notes . ami_da_7
A 76.07 It is not as interesting as it should be ami_da_9
A 76.07 because we just had the meeting , ami_da_4
A 76.07 but I will show them . ami_da_7
A 81.98 We will get your presentations again on the conceptual design . ami_da_4
A 86.06 Then we will have to dec decide about the control , the remote control concepts . ami_da_4
A 91.97 I have put a f a file in the project management folder , which says exactly what kind of decisions we should take . ami_da_4
A 99.88 So this time we exactly know what to decide about . ami_da_4
D 103.84 Alright , great . ami_da_9
A 104.55 And then we will close again . ami_da_4
C 106.3 Alright . ami_da_1
A 107.19 Well these are some examples , ami_da_4
A 107.19 but we will talk about them later . ami_da_6
A 112.36 We will first look at your presentations . ami_da_6
A 114.52 Alright ? ami_da_6
A 114.52 Walter will start again this time ? ami_da_6
A 114.52 Yo . ami_da_1
D 118.23 Yeah , great . ami_da_9
D 120.97 Alright , Trendwatch . ami_da_4
A 123.53 Okay . ami_da_2
D 138.1 Right . ami_da_2
D 141.51 I will speak about latest trends trends , latest fashion updates , and things we must not do . ami_da_4
A 148.72 Okay . ami_da_1
D 148.93 the trends . ami_da_4
D 150.81 It is very important that the control is fancy looking and good feeling . ami_da_4
D 157.49 this because of our last model was very functional , but it people did not like that , so our new mo model must be very good looking . ami_da_4
D 167.46 That is something you have to take a look at . ami_da_4
C 171.46 Alright . ami_da_12
D 171.7 And the feeling has to be very great . ami_da_4
D 173.89 Also the menus and things like that they have to they have to feel great . ami_da_4
C 178.26 Alright . ami_da_1
D 178.52 there is a minus two times here , because this is the most important point . ami_da_4
D 183.85 This is two times as less important , and same for this one . ami_da_4
A 185.65 Less . ami_da_4
D 188.8 , technological technological innovations , that is regarded very highly too . ami_da_4
D 197.45 such as an LCD screen , speech acknowledgement , as we talked about earlier . ami_da_4
A 203.16 Well , yeah . ami_da_1
D 204.87 So we have to have something like that , ami_da_4
D 204.87 like we ami_da_3
D 204.87 Right . ami_da_9
A 207.78 LCD and our our fronts . ami_da_4
D 212.47 the last point is easy to use . ami_da_4
D 214.42 Well I think that speaks for s for itself . ami_da_4
D 217.84 I do not know who is who is going to look at that . ami_da_8
C 220.88 Easy to use ? ami_da_16
C 220.88 I think that is your ta ami_da_4
A 221.54 Well , easy to use s is a bit contradictionary with the first Functional is not an issue , and then easy to use . ami_da_4
D 221.67 Yeah ? ami_da_9
D 221.67 Yeah , I know . ami_da_9
A 230.13 Well we have to choose one of them . ami_da_4
D 232.37 I think we have to go for the first one . ami_da_4
A 233.7 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 233.85 It is the most important one . ami_da_9
D 235.31 So we have to take that one . ami_da_4
A 238.4 Okay . ami_da_1
D 239.35 So it it it is not very important that that it works easy . ami_da_4
B 245.03 Well something fancy looking can be can be easy to use . ami_da_4
D 245.11 But it has to look great . ami_da_4
A 248.61 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 249.62 We will we will look at . ami_da_3
D 251.46 We will see . ami_da_9
C 251.63 You ami_da_3
C 251.63 Yeah . ami_da_9
C 252.73 Yeah , yeah , ami_da_9
C 252.73 you can make a very complicated remote anyway , so ease of use ami_da_4
C 252.73 It is not a very comp complicated device . ami_da_4
D 257.56 Yeah , right . ami_da_1
D 260.04 But the most important thing is that it looks great and people say wow , that is real great great concept . ami_da_4
C 266.24 Alright . ami_da_1
A 266.48 Okay . ami_da_1
D 267.02 Alright . ami_da_2
D 267.71 these are the new colours of this year . ami_da_1
D 270.69 So it must be very bright , very colourful . ami_da_4
D 273.51 People like this . ami_da_4
D 275.67 So we we have to think in this direction . ami_da_4
D 278.83 So i set your mind to it . ami_da_6
A 278.99 So ami_da_2
A 278.99 Well ami_da_3
A 278.99 Yeah , ami_da_1
A 278.99 well Yeah . ami_da_1
D 282.19 Findings ? ami_da_4
D 282.19 Fashion update ? ami_da_4
D 282.19 Fruit and vegetables are cool . ami_da_4
D 287.67 I am told . ami_da_4
C 290.17 you think ? ami_da_9
D 290.43 The group we are targeting is very pleased with fruit and vegetables . ami_da_4
D 294.36 So we we we might cons consider in front of in in that sort of way . ami_da_6
B 302.49 Bananas . ami_da_6
D 302.66 furthermore material , that is your part , should be very strong . ami_da_4
D 307.07 I was thinking of something like well iron plate over it , maybe in a colour or something , ami_da_6
D 307.07 that looks so f really flashy but ami_da_4
D 307.07 it it is also strong . ami_da_4
D 317.42 And that is also for the younger public . ami_da_4
A 317.54 B ami_da_3
A 317.54 Well the the handy thing about our fronts is that we can follow these trends e ev every year . ami_da_4
A 324.59 Th this year it is fruits but next year it is it is something totally different . ami_da_4
D 327.16 Yeah , that is great . ami_da_9
B 328.46 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 328.71 But I think we can all make the the fronts of titanium or something really thin . ami_da_6
A 332.86 Yes . ami_da_1
D 334.17 So it looks very heavy but you can still use it very easily . ami_da_4
A 338.51 Yep , alright . ami_da_9
D 339.93 Well , the do nots . ami_da_4
D 341.58 Older people like dark colours and simple shapes . ami_da_4
D 344.41 Well we do not want older people , we want young people . ami_da_4
D 347.83 So we are going to turn that around . ami_da_4
D 350.76 We are going to have real cool shapes and lots of colours . ami_da_4
C 350.8 Alright . ami_da_1
D 355.39 Right ? ami_da_13
D 355.39 Okay . ami_da_2
A 356.1 Wood is popular . ami_da_4
A 357.55 Aha . ami_da_4
D 357.92 We do not want wood . ami_da_4
C 359.14 Yeah , among the old people , yeah . ami_da_9
A 359.31 Yeah ami_da_9
A 359.31 yeah ami_da_9
A 359.31 yeah . ami_da_9
D 360.81 Old people . ami_da_4
D 362.0 So , that is it for me . ami_da_4
A 363.52 Alright . ami_da_14
A 364.69 Nice , well show us . ami_da_14
C 377.96 Right , I am going to tell you something about the components design . ami_da_4
C 384.37 again I have put up the specification properties . ami_da_4
C 387.75 This so the different components of the of of the device . ami_da_4
C 394.62 And the materials ? ami_da_4
C 394.62 I have heard several things , ami_da_4
C 394.62 so I I will have to change that on the way . ami_da_7
C 400.44 But the case ? ami_da_4
C 400.44 I suggested in the previous meeting hard plastic . ami_da_4
C 405.11 But as you indicated it should be strong . ami_da_4
D 405.92 Yeah , we should change that . ami_da_4
C 407.6 It should feel strong . ami_da_4
C 408.43 So maybe plastic is not sufficient . ami_da_9
C 411.2 We should move to something ami_da_3
C 411.2 Well yeah . ami_da_9
A 411.66 Well maybe it it it is , but it does not look strong . ami_da_9
A 415.12 So maybe ami_da_3
A 415.12 But we still have to look at our price of course . ami_da_4
C 416.1 Y Hard plastic i is of course pretty pretty tough , but it does not have a really really tough look . ami_da_4
D 421.61 No no no . ami_da_9
C 422.68 So ami_da_4
C 422.68 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 424.27 Because if we want an LCD window etcetera ami_da_4
A 424.27 Yeah ? ami_da_1
A 424.27 Yes . ami_da_1
C 424.73 Also ami_da_3
C 424.73 Yeah . ami_da_9
C 427.5 But we will return to that . ami_da_6
C 428.84 the buttons of course rubber , I think everyone agrees . ami_da_4
C 430.95 And electrical cables , copper is all pretty basic stuff . ami_da_4
C 434.86 The chips made of silicon , I guess . ami_da_4
C 436.91 I think that is the best way to do it . ami_da_9
C 438.7 And infra infrared l LED is just a simple bulb . ami_da_4
C 444.63 Then I have had a few findings , made a few findings . ami_da_4
C 448.54 the target audience product style . ami_da_4
C 451.4 it is generally the case that senior and wealthy people above forty five years old like , as you said , particularly the traditional materials as such as wood and materials such as that . ami_da_4
C 465.96 They also like straightforward shapes and luxurious style . ami_da_4
C 469.37 But of course that is not our things this . ami_da_4
C 471.73 So this is things we must not do . ami_da_4
C 474.06 And then we have young and dynamic people , which is of course our group , the people we aim at . ami_da_4
C 480.78 under forty five years old . ami_da_4
C 483.41 they like soft materials with primary colours . ami_da_4
C 488.57 Soft materials is of course agai again a bit a contradiction with our material choice of what you said , that it should be hard an and and and and strong looking . ami_da_4
D 499.05 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 499.26 But they like soft materials , ami_da_4
C 499.26 so we might we have to consider that . ami_da_6
B 499.68 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 503.84 And also they like curved round shapes . ami_da_4
C 506.11 So not too formal like like the older people want . ami_da_4
C 510.52 And if also a finding but not very ap applicable here , that sports and gaming devices such as discmans for jogging and that those kind of devices , gaming devices , should define the characteristics of the device . ami_da_4
C 524.27 But since we do not have a really a sports or gaming device , so we do not really have to consider that . ami_da_4
A 529.05 Sports , they are that are accessible on on your LCD window ami_da_6
A 529.05 Huh ? ami_da_1
A 529.05 That is nice . ami_da_9
B 532.4 Soccer fronts . ami_da_6
C 539.81 Well I also have several examples of styles , so you can get a clear picture of what I mean . ami_da_4
A 539.92 All the results ? ami_da_3
A 539.92 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 541.15 We keep coming back to the fronts . ami_da_4
B 543.0 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 551.01 these are the basic older older peoples' stuff . ami_da_4
A 556.94 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 557.09 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 557.9 It was not very interesting , ami_da_9
C 557.9 very classical looking , but that is n that is not what we want . ami_da_4
C 562.5 We have these kind of things . ami_da_4
C 564.08 I do not know what exactly they are . ami_da_4
C 565.31 It looks like ami_da_3
C 565.31 Well you know you recognise the shapes , it is very primary colours , bright colours and round shapes . ami_da_4
A 565.39 Nai . ami_da_1
A 565.53 no . ami_da_1
C 573.07 You also see this device , it is not very round and ami_da_4
C 573.07 Fruity of course . ami_da_9
D 577.48 Fruity . ami_da_9
D 579.22 Fruity . ami_da_9
C 579.37 Yeah , it ami_da_3
C 579.37 That is true . ami_da_9
A 580.35 It is t terrible . ami_da_9
A 581.99 Alright . ami_da_2
C 582.65 And well round shapes , primary colours . ami_da_4
C 584.81 You can see it all here . ami_da_4
C 586.05 And of course this famous device . ami_da_4
A 586.8 Yeah , alright . ami_da_1
C 588.4 I think as you know something some devices like this . ami_da_4
C 592.55 So to give you an idea of ami_da_3
C 592.55 This has a strong look . ami_da_9
D 592.63 Well it is got a strong look , this . ami_da_9
C 596.02 Although it is plastic , it is it is grey to to to give it iron look . ami_da_4
D 596.09 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 597.67 Yeah , it still has a strong look . ami_da_9
A 599.52 Yeah . ami_da_4
A 600.64 And it is round . ami_da_4
C 601.11 That is ami_da_3
C 601.11 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 601.6 But then you are losing your fruity colours . ami_da_4
C 604.11 Well we have to make a ami_da_3
C 604.11 Well we ca not really make a round a round remote control . ami_da_4
A 604.94 Well you can make th th th that middle ring ami_da_6
A 604.94 can you you can make another colour . ami_da_6
D 609.25 That is true . ami_da_9
A 609.52 So those kind of things you can you can combine . ami_da_6
C 613.98 I do not think that is very practical , ami_da_9
C 613.98 but But it is important to to to think about the colour . ami_da_4
A 615.25 No , it is not . ami_da_9
A 619.56 Okay . ami_da_1
C 620.28 Because if we make it grey or or silvery looking , it it does make it a lot more does make it looking a lot more stronger . ami_da_4
D 627.59 Yeah but the ami_da_3
D 627.59 But it does not have to look strong . ami_da_4
A 627.69 Yes . ami_da_1
C 627.75 Because if you look at this , it it does not look very very strong , becau ami_da_4
C 627.75 But this is plastic , and and this too , but ami_da_4
C 627.75 The feel ? ami_da_12
C 627.75 alright . ami_da_1
D 633.81 The the results are , the feel of the material is expected to be strongy . ami_da_4
D 639.59 The feel . ami_da_4
C 641.68 Well ami_da_2
A 641.78 So , if you ti ami_da_3
A 641.78 Well You you ami_da_3
A 641.78 Maybe you should have some some coloured titanium or something . ami_da_6
B 642.4 And it it does not have to be strong , also . ami_da_4
D 644.89 Nah ami_da_9
D 644.89 yeah ami_da_9
D 644.89 the feel ami_da_9
D 644.89 Right . ami_da_1
B 646.5 Only the feel . ami_da_6
A 650.31 So it it looks pretty but it feels strong . ami_da_4
B 653.9 Oh . ami_da_1
D 655.0 I agree . ami_da_9
C 655.1 And I Then I have some more findings . ami_da_4
C 656.86 about the energy energy source of the of the device , ami_da_4
C 656.86 I suggest the basic battery . ami_da_6
C 664.46 I got some other energy sources of course . ami_da_4
C 668.13 But solar energy is not very practical inside a house , because you do not have a have a lot of sun . ami_da_4
C 672.96 And kinetic and and and dynamos are are not very practical , I think , for for a simple remote , that is a bit , ami_da_9
C 672.96 oh , that is a bit That is a bit much . ami_da_9
A 681.44 No titanium . ami_da_9
C 686.13 And I also suggest as a shape a double curved case . ami_da_6
C 691.01 the disadvantage of that that you can use no titanium . ami_da_4
C 695.15 That that is the information I received . ami_da_4
C 697.12 If you use the curved case , a curved case , double curved then you ca not use titanium . ami_da_4
A 701.82 What do you exactly mean with double curved ? ami_da_5
A 701.82 Double curved ? ami_da_12
A 701.82 It it mean ami_da_3
A 701.82 Yeah , well okay . ami_da_9
C 703.57 Now this to give it a more modern look . ami_da_4
C 706.89 And now the the shape , yeah , a curved case . ami_da_4
C 711.07 yeah ami_da_4
C 711.07 I think sort of triangle shaped bottom or something . ami_da_4
C 716.29 a more modern look not plain , long box style , but ami_da_4
C 716.29 I will draw it , but maybe later . ami_da_7
D 722.4 I dunno . ami_da_4
B 723.05 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 724.84 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 726.84 And it makes it gives it a more u user friendly shape , than if you have . ami_da_4
C 731.73 anyway ami_da_2
C 731.73 f as for the buttons , simple push buttons . ami_da_4
C 736.13 No otherwi no difficult scroll things or some things like that , ami_da_6
C 736.13 because it makes more complex and expensive . ami_da_4
C 744.36 And , as we agreed , we do not use a speaker or a sensor or speak speech controlled device . ami_da_4
D 751.32 Yeah right . ami_da_1
C 754.44 Because it makes it also more complex and expensive . ami_da_4
C 756.16 But we do use an LCD screen , so we we do have to consider of we have to use a more advanced chip , which is more complex and expensive . ami_da_4
C 764.11 But It is worth the trouble I think , ami_da_9
C 764.11 because ami_da_3
C 764.11 rubber is a soft material , I guess . ami_da_4
A 765.17 Well ami_da_3
A 765.17 This soft material thing from Yeah . ami_da_12
B 766.65 The buttons can be made of an a soft material . ami_da_4
B 770.73 Because people like that . ami_da_4
D 774.56 Yeah . ami_da_9
C 774.77 soft enough . ami_da_9
B 774.9 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 775.28 Right . ami_da_9
B 775.54 Right . ami_da_9
B 775.89 Yeah . ami_da_9
C 776.63 So that is basically what I want to talk about . ami_da_4
A 777.59 Alright . ami_da_2
A 779.1 Okay . ami_da_2
A 780.08 We will take that . ami_da_4
A 780.84 And then Mike ? ami_da_6
A 780.84 Okay . ami_da_2
B 800.45 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 804.63 Well nah the method we will include the buttons as we discussed earlier . ami_da_4
B 812.35 an LCD s screen will be implemented . ami_da_4
B 815.72 we must decide where , this meeting . ami_da_4
B 819.11 there are new developments in speech recognition systems , and they are already being used on coffee machines . ami_da_4
B 830.14 And well they are cheap , ami_da_4
B 830.14 so we could use them now . ami_da_6
A 834.24 Oh ami_da_16
A 834.24 That is interesting . ami_da_9
B 835.82 it is not really speech recognition , it is more like you can talk to the chip , record the message and record an answer , ami_da_4
B 835.82 and then once you talk to the remote , then he will a answer with the the prerecorded message that you left . ami_da_4
B 856.41 So if I say hi Mike , and you have recorded hi ami_da_4
B 856.41 Mike back , then you will get that . ami_da_4
C 856.72 Oh , yeah , I understand . ami_da_12
D 856.77 Oh okay . ami_da_12
C 857.87 Yeah . ami_da_12
A 862.52 Okay . ami_da_5
D 863.38 Right . ami_da_1
A 863.66 But you can also say that , when you say something , it does some function . ami_da_5
B 867.4 No it does not does not do anything . ami_da_4
D 868.13 No . ami_da_1
A 868.88 Oh . ami_da_16
B 870.07 But i it is just a ami_da_3
B 870.07 Yeah it is it is cheap . ami_da_9
A 870.21 That is a bit ami_da_3
A 870.21 Yes . ami_da_12
D 870.25 But that that makes it cheap . ami_da_4
D 872.0 It is it is just a an extra function , and it is cheap . ami_da_4
C 872.33 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 873.36 I understand . ami_da_12
A 874.5 But it has no functionality for our remote at all . ami_da_4
D 876.05 No ami_da_3
D 876.05 but ami_da_3
D 876.05 Yeah , right . ami_da_9
B 876.43 No ami_da_9
B 876.43 but that is the gadget they want , or the gimmicks . ami_da_4
C 878.97 But it it is n nice for young people . ami_da_4
D 879.53 Young people love them . ami_da_4
B 880.68 Yes , we we should really include that one , I think . ami_da_6
C 880.96 They like gadgets . ami_da_4
D 881.23 Yeah , ple ami_da_3
D 881.23 Right . ami_da_1
C 881.61 Yeah . ami_da_9
C 884.23 If it is cheap . ami_da_9
B 884.44 Well , as I said earlier I think the LCD screen should be positioned at the lower end of the remote . ami_da_6
C 884.78 Yeah . ami_da_9
B 892.72 the buttons for screen width and general settings and and that kind of stuff we can also do let that kind of functions be shown in the LCD screen , instead of extra buttons . ami_da_6
A 907.96 So you put a menu in the LCD ? ami_da_5
B 911.07 I think young people and yeah ami_da_4
B 911.07 w well every user would like that . ami_da_4
B 918.47 the buttons should be positioned positioned the same way as they are on a , well , conventional remote , I think . ami_da_6
B 928.79 For the learnability and well to keep it recognisable . ami_da_4
B 934.03 A voice recognition can be implemented . ami_da_4
B 937.92 And I drew an example , ami_da_4
B 937.92 but it did not work quite the well the way I wanted it to do . ami_da_9
D 942.26 Alright . ami_da_1
C 943.14 Can you draw it now of ami_da_6
C 943.14 Can you draw it now ? ami_da_6
D 943.51 How How ami_da_3
D 943.51 How do you give input to the menu on the LCD screen ? ami_da_5
D 943.51 Alright . ami_da_12
B 944.5 Well I have the ami_da_7
B 944.5 I can draw it again , ami_da_7
B 944.5 and I know what I did wrong . ami_da_4
B 948.1 I did not tick the note bo box in the . ami_da_4
C 951.12 Alright . ami_da_1
B 952.05 with the the up and down and and well buttons and the ami_da_4
B 952.05 Well I will draw what I had drawn on the screen . ami_da_7
D 962.29 So you have a menu button , and then you can go up and down . ami_da_4
A 964.8 But then we should also have an an Okay button . ami_da_6
D 968.71 Yeah right . ami_da_9
B 968.98 Yes . ami_da_9
B 969.79 I shall draw this . ami_da_7
C 971.12 button , yeah . ami_da_3
B 972.78 If it works . ami_da_7
A 976.59 Just ami_da_3
A 976.59 There is already a blank . ami_da_5
A 978.43 Yes ? ami_da_5
A 978.43 So Yeah . ami_da_2
D 979.12 Yeah . ami_da_4
B 981.0 so have I . ami_da_3
B 985.9 Nah . ami_da_9
D 991.54 You have to push hard . ami_da_6
C 1005.65 I suggest a banana shape . ami_da_6
C 1008.65 Because of the fruity fashion . ami_da_4
D 1008.67 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 1010.22 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 1011.64 No ami_da_9
A 1011.64 m ami_da_4
A 1011.64 Next year that is out . ami_da_4
C 1012.64 Yellow and ami_da_6
C 1012.64 Yeah alright , yeah . ami_da_12
C 1016.79 Just a hunch . ami_da_9
B 1020.7 Well these little buttons are a bit difficult to draw correct . ami_da_9
A 1024.14 Yeah . ami_da_9
C 1026.5 Those are the the cha the channel buttons of course ? ami_da_5
C 1026.5 And then below is the LCD screen ? ami_da_5
C 1026.5 Alright , yeah . ami_da_12
B 1028.27 Yeah just the numbers . ami_da_4
B 1039.34 These these will be bigger in the the real design . ami_da_4
B 1044.23 This must be the Okay button used to interact with the LCD screen . ami_da_4
B 1049.47 And with this you can , yes , go to through the menus ami_da_4
B 1049.47 and that can ami_da_3
B 1049.47 the video button should be an apart button , because you want it to t , ami_da_4
B 1049.47 yeah , ami_da_4
B 1049.47 to use it fast within one click . ami_da_4
A 1050.81 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 1055.37 You have ami_da_3
D 1055.37 Right . ami_da_1
A 1058.44 Yes . ami_da_1
A 1065.08 And what is the menu button ? ami_da_5
A 1065.08 But how did How do you get out of the menu then ? ami_da_5
A 1065.08 Yeah . ami_da_5
D 1065.12 And you you need a you need a speaker . ami_da_6
B 1065.26 it is ami_da_3
B 1065.26 This button can also be the Menu button , we use in the menus ami_da_6
B 1065.26 Well we we can add another button here , but ami_da_6
B 1065.26 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 1068.48 For the ami_da_3
D 1068.48 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 1077.83 Maybe I you could j just do an an exit with Okay . ami_da_6
C 1078.61 by pe pressing the menu button again . ami_da_4
C 1081.05 By pressing the menu button again , you go out . ami_da_4
A 1081.4 Yes , well but ami_da_2
A 1081.4 bec because when you push Menu you get in , and then you have to push ami_da_4
A 1081.4 Okay when you get to a choice . ami_da_4
D 1083.09 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 1083.45 It is usual the the the d kind of the way it works . ami_da_4
C 1088.14 Yeah ? ami_da_1
C 1088.14 Yeah ? ami_da_1
C 1088.14 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 1091.17 right . ami_da_12
B 1092.15 Well you you ami_da_3
B 1092.15 No no , ami_da_9
B 1092.15 we we we should add a extra Menu button ami_da_6
B 1092.15 and this the Okay button . ami_da_4
A 1092.26 Well that is also the Okay button . ami_da_4
C 1092.34 But you can men you can press menu again to get out . ami_da_4
A 1096.98 That is you you should have ami_da_3
A 1096.98 Or you can put in the LCD is window an option Get Out . ami_da_6
C 1097.76 No . ami_da_9
D 1106.84 Exit . ami_da_6
A 1107.78 Exit . ami_da_6
B 1108.27 once you have an extra Menu button , you do not need that that extra option . ami_da_4
A 1112.28 Well , it is just a choice . ami_da_4
B 1112.99 You have redundancy . ami_da_4
D 1113.18 But we need a we need a a recording recording button for the speech part . ami_da_4
D 1118.97 Or do not ami_da_3
D 1118.97 Right , ami_da_1
D 1118.97 and spea speaker at the back , or something . ami_da_6
B 1119.22 Yeah , ami_da_9
B 1119.22 if we decide to to implement that , maybe we should . ami_da_6
C 1121.62 Why would you put it then , and where is the recording the microphone ? ami_da_8
C 1121.62 Where would you put it ? ami_da_8
C 1121.62 Uh huh . ami_da_1
B 1127.01 Well they that could be anywhere . ami_da_4
B 1128.34 That is very small . ami_da_4
B 1129.1 It could be down here . ami_da_6
B 1134.73 Well , not here . ami_da_4
B 1135.4 I ami_da_6
B 1135.4 yeah ami_da_6
B 1135.4 I suggest here . ami_da_6
B 1137.23 But that is just a little gap . ami_da_4
C 1139.56 Microphone , yeah . ami_da_4
B 1140.34 Yeah . ami_da_4
B 1141.84 Well the speaker and the microphone , I think , are the same little hole thingy . ami_da_4
C 1148.45 Yeah I understand . ami_da_12
B 1149.35 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 1149.66 but we could d do , but it is perhaps more expensive , the speaker on the back or something . ami_da_6
D 1149.7 Alright . ami_da_1
B 1154.16 Well i ami_da_3
B 1154.16 there are a all already being implemented in in coffee machines , so they wo not be very expensive . ami_da_4
B 1163.49 But This is my suggested design . ami_da_4
A 1164.33 Huh ? ami_da_1
A 1164.33 Yeah ? ami_da_1
A 1164.33 Okay . ami_da_1
C 1165.13 Alright . ami_da_1
D 1165.58 Alright . ami_da_1
A 1168.53 Well , okay , alright . ami_da_2
B 1169.89 Yes . ami_da_2
A 1170.07 then let is have a look at the decisions we are going to have to make . ami_da_6
B 1175.63 And oh I think as you can see so , the LCD screen does look better at the lower end , or at the bottom . ami_da_9
A 1182.68 I would I agree . ami_da_9
D 1184.2 Yeah , fine . ami_da_9
B 1184.37 But ami_da_3
B 1184.37 Oh , I had some examples . ami_da_7
A 1185.82 Fine . ami_da_9
D 1187.15 Move on . ami_da_6
C 1187.64 Well yeah ami_da_9
C 1187.64 yeah ami_da_9
C 1187.64 yeah . ami_da_9
A 1190.0 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 1192.73 I can live with it . ami_da_9
B 1193.25 You can ami_da_3
B 1193.25 But I did not like it very much , but Well these are quite obvious , very ugly remote . ami_da_9
A 1193.58 Yes ? ami_da_9
A 1193.58 Too big . ami_da_9
D 1206.97 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 1208.07 They do they do not look fruity enough . ami_da_4
B 1208.23 No , well th ami_da_3
B 1208.23 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 1209.85 Nei They are n they are not trendy . ami_da_4
A 1210.72 They are all black . ami_da_4
B 1213.67 Well not all . ami_da_9
A 1216.66 Hey , that one I like . ami_da_9
B 1218.8 this is for children but th ami_da_4

C 1218.87 Tho ami_da_3
C 1218.87 Yeah those ami_da_3
C 1218.87 But it does not the ami_da_3
C 1218.87 Yeah , ok Yeah . ami_da_1
D 1220.16 It does not look strong . ami_da_9
A 1221.53 No . ami_da_9
B 1223.42 W but with the colours ami_da_4
B 1223.42 i it is a bit the way we are going to . ami_da_4
A 1224.95 The remote . ami_da_14
D 1226.42 Yeah right . ami_da_1
B 1227.62 Well this is a terrible ami_da_9
B 1227.62 this looks ami_da_3
B 1227.62 Yeah . ami_da_9

C 1232.78 But it it must not look too childish of course huh ? ami_da_6
C 1232.78 But it ami_da_3
C 1232.78 Yeah . ami_da_3
A 1233.47 Too many buttons . ami_da_9
A 1234.22 That is ami_da_3
A 1234.22 Well , that is too expensive I think . ami_da_4
B 1235.13 This these are the LCD screens . ami_da_4
B 1237.14 I think we should , if it is possible , one with colours , but ami_da_6
B 1237.14 I do not know ami_da_3
B 1237.14 Too expensive ? ami_da_12
B 1237.14 Alright . ami_da_9

B 1253.86 Yeah , this is what we have just done . ami_da_4
A 1254.43 no . ami_da_1
D 1257.73 But are we going for a strange form ? ami_da_5
D 1257.73 Because people like that . ami_da_4
A 1257.78 Okay . ami_da_2
A 1261.3 No , not very strange . ami_da_4

D 1263.82 Not too strange . ami_da_4
C 1264.3 No . ami_da_4
D 1264.37 You can make the the underside , you can make it more round , where the LCD is . ami_da_6
A 1264.38 It still has t ami_da_3
A 1264.38 Yes . ami_da_9
A 1268.08 Th ami_da_3
A 1268.08 a a kind of bridge . ami_da_6
A 1270.21 So it f falls over the hand . ami_da_6
D 1270.41 I dunno if you know the No Nokia telephone , with the round thing at at the bottoms , s something like that . ami_da_6
A 1274.87 Yeah ? ami_da_1

A 1280.06 Well I have at home a remote with a bridge . ami_da_4
A 1282.84 It is just a half round half half circle at ami_da_4
A 1282.84 And then it falls exactly over the hand , ami_da_4
A 1282.84 and that is very nice . ami_da_9
A 1289.67 That is It feels comfortable . ami_da_4
C 1294.42 Exotic yeah . ami_da_4
D 1295.33 Yeah , different . ami_da_4
C 1295.97 We have t ami_da_3

C 1295.97 yeah . ami_da_9
A 1296.93 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 1297.27 I will design it , we design it later . ami_da_7
D 1297.54 Y yis ami_da_3
D 1297.54 Alright . ami_da_1
C 1299.12 So we will get to that later I guess . ami_da_4
D 1300.69 Great . ami_da_1
A 1300.87 Yeah , alright . ami_da_2
A 1301.66 where did I put it ? ami_da_5
A 1301.66 conceptual phase , I think this is it . ami_da_4
C 1303.92 The specific shape . ami_da_3
C 1304.99 The ami_da_3
C 1304.99 Our sources . ami_da_14
A 1309.93 I got this from our friends . ami_da_4
A 1313.68 So yeah the conceptual design . ami_da_4
A 1319.31 These are a few examples which we have to decide about . ami_da_4
A 1322.39 All the the materials from the case , the electric cable that is all your your side of the story . ami_da_4
A 1331.08 Yeah . ami_da_14
D 1331.47 Your bag . ami_da_14
A 1334.51 now from the user interface , your package ? ami_da_4
A 1334.51 where ami_da_3
A 1334.51 No well , that is more like the buttons where they have to come . ami_da_4
A 1343.71 And B a bit of , yeah well , a bit of design . ami_da_4
C 1352.85 But we should decide now . ami_da_4
A 1352.96 Yes , ami_da_9
A 1352.96 but we have to decide about these now . ami_da_4
B 1353.17 Right ? ami_da_4
B 1353.17 right . ami_da_12
D 1354.96 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 1355.9 Materials are the most , most impor ami_da_4
D 1355.9 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 1356.01 And the trend watching . ami_da_4
A 1357.89 So as you said , fruity is in , well sells good . ami_da_4
A 1361.47 Wow . ami_da_16
A 1362.29 these things . ami_da_4
C 1363.49 So we have to put it in one document . ami_da_5
A 1366.59 yes . ami_da_4
A 1367.46 so if we go through them ami_da_6
A 1367.46 Yeah well ami_da_2
A 1367.46 Why should I ami_da_3
A 1367.46 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 1369.59 Copy paste this story into a into a Word document , and then put the answers after the subjects . ami_da_6
C 1376.98 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 1380.14 Not everything . ami_da_4
C 1382.38 Well we have to decide all these things ? ami_da_4
C 1382.38 W we can override them ? ami_da_6
C 1382.38 Well a case ? ami_da_4
C 1382.38 that is me . ami_da_4
B 1384.08 Yeah but all these examples are of a coffee machine . ami_da_4
A 1394.93 So ami_da_2
A 1394.93 What what kind of properties should it have ? ami_da_5
A 1394.93 Well we just listened . ami_da_4
C 1397.44 I suggest ami_da_3
C 1397.44 Well what do I suggest actually ? ami_da_8
C 1397.44 s solid , ami_da_4
C 1397.44 yeah . ami_da_9
B 1404.01 I think we ami_da_3
B 1404.01 Why do not we use titanium or or a hard , yeah , some kind of metal for the the the whole remote except the front . ami_da_6
C 1405.9 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 1413.43 Do you know the new ami_da_3
D 1413.43 No no ami_da_1
D 1413.43 The front is the most important . ami_da_4
B 1415.81 That ami_da_3
B 1415.81 Just like most cell phones are . ami_da_4
C 1418.64 Yeah , I understand . ami_da_12
C 1420.91 Yeah . ami_da_2
C 1421.98 So we have titanium . ami_da_4
C 1425.15 Yeah but the non removable elements of the of the remote , so not the front , could be titanium , ami_da_6
C 1425.15 to give that strong look . ami_da_4
B 1432.23 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 1433.55 You know what ? ami_da_16
A 1433.55 Alright . ami_da_2
C 1433.89 And then the front is made of plastic . ami_da_6
C 1435.55 And you can put that on and off , and switch it . ami_da_4
B 1441.08 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 1441.37 But the feel of plastic is not strong . ami_da_9
C 1443.29 No but you have titanium of course . ami_da_4
B 1443.8 No but you you have this ami_da_3
B 1443.8 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 1445.36 you have the best of both worlds . ami_da_4
D 1446.44 Yeah alright , alright . ami_da_9
D 1448.24 Okay . ami_da_9
B 1448.58 Yeah , you have the re remote in your hand like this . ami_da_6
B 1450.56 So you feel titanium . ami_da_4
C 1453.66 And of course , yeah , you have the the the plastic front end . ami_da_4
C 1456.12 But you also have the titanium . ami_da_4
D 1456.47 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 1457.63 Fronts are are cheaper than when they are from plas ami_da_4
D 1457.63 Yeah , ami_da_4
D 1457.63 but it it is expensive . ami_da_4
B 1459.63 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 1459.96 Yeah of course , ami_da_9
C 1459.96 but yeah you have to make a decision . ami_da_4
B 1463.36 And I do not know if you can make steel just any way you want it to . ami_da_4
C 1469.17 I guess so . ami_da_9
C 1469.73 titanium ami_da_3
C 1469.73 I sh ami_da_3
C 1469.73 I think ami_da_3
C 1469.73 Huh ? ami_da_12
C 1469.73 Well , well the ami_da_3
C 1469.73 According to my sources , it is it is totally possible to make an entire Titanium is available , and we can make an entire remote out of it , if we want . ami_da_4
B 1469.9 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 1471.6 Bendable . ami_da_4
D 1473.06 Bendable . ami_da_4
B 1474.24 Well any colour ami_da_4
B 1474.24 Yeah , ami_da_9
B 1474.24 then you you paint it in the colour you want it . ami_da_4
D 1488.83 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 1489.08 The plastic is is the colour you want it . ami_da_4
D 1490.25 Paint spray . ami_da_4
D 1492.33 Yeah alright . ami_da_1
B 1494.28 So Yeah . ami_da_1
D 1495.46 So , ami_da_2
D 1495.46 we are going for a titanium back and a plastic front ? ami_da_11
D 1495.46 Yeah , great . ami_da_1
A 1497.98 I have ami_da_3
A 1497.98 Titanium back , plastic front . ami_da_4
C 1498.78 Yeah , I think that is a nice trade off . ami_da_9
A 1501.82 Okay . ami_da_9
A 1503.08 well I am going to put it in here , because we can look . ami_da_4
B 1506.61 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 1506.72 I solid feel and trendy look . ami_da_4
C 1507.4 Alright . ami_da_1
A 1513.91 So material , hard plastic ami_da_5
A 1513.91 for the front ? ami_da_4
A 1513.91 Okay . ami_da_2
C 1518.45 Yeah , for the front and then titanium for the back . ami_da_4
D 1519.49 Yeah . ami_da_4
C 1522.52 For the non removable part . ami_da_4
D 1524.37 But then you have the problem , when you have a titanium back , you ca not switch it . ami_da_4
D 1529.17 When you want an other colour on the front , it does not match . ami_da_4
C 1533.82 Well but The titan titanium is not is not v very ami_da_3
C 1533.82 Yeah , i it does not curves . ami_da_4
D 1533.84 You know ? ami_da_1
D 1533.84 I understand . ami_da_12
B 1534.24 Well titanium is neutral . ami_da_4
C 1541.97 No I nei . ami_da_3
C 1543.82 Titanium is very ami_da_3
C 1543.82 No no no , ami_da_16
C 1543.82 but you know b Titanium is very basic colour , and it does not really matter if we have a purple front on it or a orange front . ami_da_4
D 1545.48 Yeah , ami_da_9
D 1545.48 yeah , ami_da_9
