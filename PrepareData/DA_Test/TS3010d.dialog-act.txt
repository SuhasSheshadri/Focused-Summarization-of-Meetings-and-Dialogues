A 188.3 Sorry . ami_da_14
D 188.9 That is ami_da_2
D 188.9 That can be none . ami_da_9
D 204.75 , we going to do the evaluation now , together . ami_da_6
D 207.61 But I have a introduction how it works . ami_da_7
D 211.51 So , it will come up . ami_da_4
D 217.43 Uh oh . ami_da_9
D 219.95 Okay . ami_da_9
D 221.67 , yeah . ami_da_2
D 222.63 Well , we , ami_da_2
D 222.63 I have thinked a few evaluation criterias , based on our marketing strategy , on the latest trends , on user preferences . ami_da_4
D 239.03 , we have a seven point scale from true , as well . ami_da_4
D 243.21 To false , seven ? ami_da_4
D 243.21 And on base of each c criteria , we need to give a rating . ami_da_4
D 249.59 We can ami_da_3
D 249.59 Well , it look like this . ami_da_4
D 251.48 But we going to do it here , they said . ami_da_4
D 255.5 So , you hope found out how to do it with a Word document . ami_da_4
D 267.26 Yeah . ami_da_16
D 277.53 Okay , yeah . ami_da_9
D 279.0 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 281.63 , well we have the Word document ami_da_4
D 281.63 You ami_da_2
D 281.63 So we open up that blank here . ami_da_4
A 287.88 Criteria . ami_da_16
D 294.36 Think I can ami_da_3
D 294.36 , what this just an example . ami_da_4
D 303.35 So , this not very important . ami_da_4
D 304.58 But , if I can get a number in here . ami_da_7
A 315.74 No , it is okay . ami_da_9
D 316.3 Well , we ca not do that . ami_da_4
A 318.66 Oh , it is okay . ami_da_9
D 319.42 , so you have to think of it as the remote control is techno technologically innovative . ami_da_4
D 330.63 , and then we have to agree on the rating together . ami_da_6
D 334.6 And in the end , we will c count an average of all rating . ami_da_6
D 339.03 The first on each item . ami_da_4
A 343.66 What do you think ? ami_da_11
A 343.66 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 345.51 Yeah , I think it is , well technologically using , it is not it does not contain many new features . ami_da_9
D 353.52 Only the LCD . ami_da_9
D 356.1 So , it ami_da_2
D 356.1 , I think I will give it a yeah ami_da_9
D 356.1 , yeah , ami_da_9
D 356.1 yeah , a four . ami_da_9
C 365.11 I think the scroll button is something also new . ami_da_9
C 370.41 What not anoth , ami_da_2
C 370.41 not a lot of a lot of remote controls have . ami_da_9
C 376.13 I think technologically I will give it an seven . ami_da_9
C 382.76 Si six six . ami_da_9
C 383.77 Sorry , six . ami_da_9
D 383.87 So now i I think you see it its statement . ami_da_4

D 402.51 , well ami_da_2
D 402.51 It is a one . ami_da_9
D 410.3 The first item . ami_da_9
D 412.52 So , okay the second item . ami_da_4
D 414.11 , this product is for all sorts of customers . ami_da_11
B 419.21 , four . ami_da_9
D 419.86 Well , it is a statement which I disagree with , because we really aim at at young market ami_da_9
D 419.86 and I think the way it looked c totally in yellow , it is not really aimed for all customers . ami_da_9
D 432.36 It does not look like that . ami_da_9
A 434.76 So it is a ami_da_11
A 434.76 Yes , it is for the younger g group . ami_da_9
D 436.2 That is a six . ami_da_9
C 438.4 Five . ami_da_9
B 447.85 Yeah , but it is it is ami_da_3
B 447.85 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 447.91 So it is half half of the people . ami_da_9
A 451.27 So I think it is four . ami_da_9
B 454.34 I mean it still has l large buttons and not m many buttons . ami_da_4
B 458.34 So I mean , the colours are for young people , ami_da_9
B 458.34 but older ami_da_3
B 458.34 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 458.6 No . ami_da_1
A 461.18 Yes . ami_da_9
A 461.63 So , I think it is four . ami_da_9
C 464.38 Maybe version three point O has other colours . ami_da_6
B 469.42 Yeah . ami_da_9
B 469.77 Maybe . ami_da_9
A 470.49 Okay . ami_da_9
A 470.98 Give it a four . ami_da_9
C 471.94 Four . ami_da_11
D 472.44 Four . ami_da_9
A 472.61 Yep . ami_da_9
D 473.31 , okay . ami_da_9
A 479.7 We put the fashion in electronics . ami_da_16
D 481.67 That is the motto of our company . ami_da_4
D 485.17 Yeah , well do we do this with this product ? ami_da_11
D 485.17 I ami_da_2
D 485.17 Yeah . ami_da_2
D 495.06 I think if we do this , as it is c it is really orientates on the design . ami_da_9
D 503.09 , so I would give it a two . ami_da_9
C 507.35 Me too a two , because only the battery is not techin technologically high standard . ami_da_9
C 515.18 But the rest of it is . ami_da_9
C 517.1 So , I think a two . ami_da_9
B 520.95 Yes . ami_da_9
B 521.15 Two . ami_da_9
D 522.46 Two . ami_da_9
A 522.87 , I say a five . ami_da_9
A 525.46 It is not fashion , it is new . ami_da_9
A 528.54 It must be a fashion . ami_da_9
A 531.04 But it is not . ami_da_9
C 531.13 It ami_da_2
C 531.13 it will be fashion . ami_da_9
A 533.2 Yes . ami_da_9
A 533.82 It w If it is not a fashion we can put it in it . ami_da_6
A 539.75 So , it must be a fashion . ami_da_4
A 543.18 I think it is a five . ami_da_9
D 549.94 Okay . ami_da_9
B 552.19 Then make it th three . ami_da_6
D 552.66 Okay . ami_da_1
D 553.52 Yes , I will think of that too . ami_da_9
A 554.44 No . ami_da_9
C 555.05 Okay . ami_da_9
A 555.27 Oh . ami_da_16
C 555.53 Three is okay . ami_da_9

C 560.05 Oh , we will wait outside . ami_da_14
A 565.54 Okay . ami_da_9
D 566.29 Yeah okay . ami_da_9
D 570.03 The next element is the product looks good . ami_da_4
D 576.0 Well personally , I do not prefer a remote control that is fully in yellow . ami_da_9
D 581.91 So , I would give this a five . ami_da_9
C 585.33 I give it a one . ami_da_9
B 592.21 Yes , a one . ami_da_9
B 593.13 I like it . ami_da_9
A 596.52 Well , I say three . ami_da_9
A 598.91 So , counting then is two and a half . ami_da_4
D 603.69 We have to do our ami_da_4
D 603.69 Two or three ? ami_da_11
D 603.69 Two . ami_da_9
C 605.24 Say two . ami_da_9
A 606.48 Okay , two . ami_da_9
C 606.91 Two . ami_da_9
D 608.05 Okay . ami_da_9
D 612.33 So , well we going to do the next part . ami_da_6
D 616.73 , yep . ami_da_2
D 619.87 , the next statement . ami_da_4
D 621.45 It has not too much buttons . ami_da_4
D 623.72 , yeah , ami_da_2
D 623.72 I I have said is not because a low number is better . ami_da_9
D 630.62 And in the end we calculate an average . ami_da_6
D 633.53 So , that is why it is a negative in it . ami_da_4
D 639.38 , well this one of our aims not have too much buttons . ami_da_4
D 643.02 So , did we do that ? ami_da_11
D 643.02 Well , if we go to this fashion , I We still have caused a lot of buttons for the numbers . ami_da_4
D 655.77 But you can you can go for that . ami_da_4
D 657.08 And that way , you do not have a lot of buttons over . ami_da_4
D 661.66 So , I would give this a two . ami_da_9
C 663.99 One . ami_da_9
A 667.56 You ? ami_da_11
A 667.56 Me too . ami_da_9

D 817.92 well it has a a nice colour , well compared to food ami_da_9
D 817.92 but we did not ami_da_2
D 817.92 We did not paint any fruit and vegetable on it for something like that . ami_da_9
C 835.82 Oh . ami_da_3
D 836.19 So , I would did not give this a one or two . ami_da_9
D 838.38 I ami_da_2
D 838.38 We will go for a three . ami_da_9
C 843.03 I go for two because the the shapes are still round . ami_da_9
C 848.92 , the latest trends are soft things , you know , like I said in my presentation . ami_da_4
D 854.23 Yes . ami_da_9

A 1677.69 Okay . ami_da_9
B 1678.63 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 1680.84 Yeah , I think you have to compare it to if you would have a normal normal project without laptops and without these devices . ami_da_6
D 1692.34 I think ami_da_2
D 1692.34 Well , the laptops if you have them out front of you , you sometimes looking at that instead of the presentation . ami_da_9
D 1701.12 , well the draw board , well you can draw things . ami_da_9
D 1706.6 But it not really going very convenient . ami_da_9
D 1711.6 , maybe it will be easier if you have a smaller monitor and you would also see there . ami_da_9
D 1717.22 And with a normal mouse . ami_da_9
D 1720.13 , and the project . ami_da_9
D 1722.58 Yeah , I agree on what was said mainly . ami_da_9
D 1726.53 , yeah ami_da_9
D 1726.53 but you always have that some people are talking more than others . ami_da_9
