A 105.22 Okay . ami_da_2
A 116.73 Okay . ami_da_2
A 117.89 we are here to develop a new product . ami_da_4
A 121.66 I am sure you have had a mail from our account manager about it . ami_da_4
A 126.45 and ami_da_2
A 126.45 this is the first meeting to to generate some some ideas about it . ami_da_4
A 133.63 you are here in a specific role . ami_da_4
A 136.99 Ruud is here as the Marketing Expert , Roo is here as the User Interface Designer and Sebastian is here in the role of Industrial Designer . ami_da_4
A 148.29 Is that correct ? ami_da_5
A 148.29 Okay . ami_da_9
C 149.05 That is correct . ami_da_4
A 150.9 we are going to do a little tool training for the tools we are going to use during the meetings we are going to have here . ami_da_6
A 163.32 then I will tell you a little bit about my idea of the project plan , ami_da_7
A 163.32 and we will have a discussion . ami_da_6
A 170.86 this meeting should take no more than twenty five minutes , so we should keep that in mind . ami_da_4
B 175.46 Alright . ami_da_1
C 175.6 Okay . ami_da_1
C 177.3 is there any room for a little presentation ? ami_da_11
C 177.3 maybe during the discussion section ? ami_da_6
C 177.3 Okay . ami_da_9
A 182.71 There is ? ami_da_9
A 182.71 Yeah , there is . ami_da_9
A 186.28 No problem . ami_da_9
A 187.36 okay , ami_da_2
A 187.36 this new product we are are ami_da_4
A 187.36 g are going to develop , it is a remote control , a television remote control . ami_da_4
A 196.6 and first of all it should be original , it should be trendy and user friendly . ami_da_4
A 201.6 Those are kind of easy goals , ami_da_9
A 201.6 and I am sure we can find more goals for the for the product we are going to develop . ami_da_6
A 213.0 we will discuss later on more ideas about how the remote should look and how it sh it should function and all those kind of things . ami_da_6
B 221.35 Okay . ami_da_1
A 223.39 The market , we should have a look at the market . ami_da_6
A 226.6 we are going to use a a pred a project method during this development , which consists of three different design stages . ami_da_4
A 238.76 the functional design , the conceptual design and the detailed design , all of these stages mean that we do some individual work , prepare , and then meet to discuss our the ami_da_4
A 238.76 the the progressions , yes . ami_da_9
B 259.96 Progressions . ami_da_4
A 262.54 the first stage , the functional design we are going to search for the user requirements , and we will make a specific specification of that . ami_da_4
A 276.49 the second is the technical functional design , what effect should the remote have ? ami_da_4
A 276.49 Well in this case control t the the television I think . ami_da_4
B 288.3 It is for the vision . ami_da_9
B 289.71 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 289.97 and the last one is the working design . ami_da_4
A 293.39 How exactly does it work in the technical sense . ami_da_4
A 297.73 the other design stages , we will discuss that later . ami_da_6
A 302.44 So we will kop it keep it with the functional design . ami_da_6
A 305.89 Okay , before we think about remote control we will work with some of the tools we have here . ami_da_6
A 313.07 as you see now I can give a presentation . ami_da_4
A 317.88 it is also possible to use this one as well . ami_da_4
A 321.61 You can display pr two presentations if you want to . ami_da_4
A 326.21 to presentate , to show us a file you will need to place it in your project documents folder , which is on your desktop , at least it should be . ami_da_4
A 340.91 then we have this electronic white board system . ami_da_4
A 345.34 yeah , I will show that now . ami_da_7
A 350.22 you can draw on the board using this pen . ami_da_4
A 355.91 There are little ami_da_4
A 355.91 sensors , ami_da_9
A 355.91 so do not grab it here , but a lit more a little bit more to the to the end . ami_da_6
B 357.45 Sensors . ami_da_4
A 364.68 well , it ami_da_2
A 364.68 it is on the eraser now , so we click the pen button . ami_da_4
A 380.26 Okay , so not too fast writing . ami_da_4
A 383.68 you can insert a new slide or or white board file by either using the insert function or by clicking the next button or the blank button . ami_da_4
A 399.22 It is quite the same . ami_da_4
A 400.85 all our whi SMARTboard notes should be kept in the same file . ami_da_6
A 410.39 So do not m make a new file . ami_da_6
A 412.85 Just use this one during the day . ami_da_6
A 416.34 you can use the eraser to make something go away . ami_da_4
B 421.52 But we all use the same white board file ami_da_5
B 421.52 So we can work together on it while we are or should we only use it in the in the meetings ? ami_da_5
B 421.52 Yeah , okay . ami_da_9
A 424.84 Yes . ami_da_4
A 428.71 Yeah . ami_da_4
A 432.04 Yeah , in the meetings , only in the meetings . ami_da_4
A 434.04 It is really like like a regu regular whiteboard . ami_da_4
B 435.57 Yeah , alright . ami_da_9
B 436.25 Yep . ami_da_9
A 437.76 you can choose the format , ami_da_4
A 437.76 sorry . ami_da_14
A 441.87 Let me see . ami_da_16
A 446.35 Well ami_da_2
A 446.35 I guess it is maybe because I am not s pen selected . ami_da_4
A 461.96 Yep . ami_da_9
A 462.68 Current colour , you can choose another colour . ami_da_4
A 465.58 And for example black , and you c I can choose the line width . ami_da_4
A 474.88 so now I d have a different line width and colour . ami_da_4
A 480.24 Okay . ami_da_2
A 480.76 Quite easy , ami_da_9
A 480.76 if you do have any questions , just c ask me . ami_da_13
A 485.03 to ami_da_2
A 485.03 oh well , I am ami_da_2
A 485.03 I wrote down the documents should be in the project documents folder if you want to discuss it with us . ami_da_4
A 494.59 as a little training I will ask Ruud first to draw your own animal on a new slide with a different colour and a different line width than the one now selected . ami_da_6
D 514.35 Okay . ami_da_7
D 528.18 green . ami_da_16
D 537.67 An animal . ami_da_2
D 538.66 Okay . ami_da_2
D 539.57 a wee rabbit . ami_da_4
B 553.13 It is a bunny . ami_da_4
A 554.86 A rabbit . ami_da_4
C 556.02 Alright . ami_da_9
A 556.1 Okay , well great . ami_da_9
A 558.57 Roo , could you do the same please ? ami_da_6
A 558.57 But a different animal with a different colour and a different line width . ami_da_6
B 561.71 But of course , Flores . ami_da_7
B 568.68 Blank . ami_da_16
A 569.44 Sebastian is thinking about the animal . ami_da_5
C 571.45 I am just guessing what should be my favourite animal . ami_da_4
A 574.34 Okay . ami_da_9
B 574.53 Yeah , I am think about it too . ami_da_4
B 577.47 Format . ami_da_16
B 603.87 Well , it looked more than a bunny than a cat , but it works , ami_da_9
B 603.87 right ? ami_da_11
B 603.87 With a very small legs . ami_da_14
A 607.7 It it should be a cat . ami_da_9
D 608.86 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 609.45 Okay ? ami_da_9
A 609.45 I am guessing a horse . ami_da_4
C 610.72 Well , I will give it a try . ami_da_7
C 648.1 Very good . ami_da_9
C 661.19 I was very good in drawing . ami_da_14
B 662.88 You should feed that that animal . ami_da_14
C 674.39 Well , I guess you get the idea . ami_da_4
A 678.47 Yes , okay . ami_da_9
C 681.33 Beautiful . ami_da_14
A 682.31 Beautiful . ami_da_14
A 684.81 Okay , so you can use this at any time during the presentation if you want to . ami_da_4
A 691.09 any questions well , just just let me know . ami_da_13
A 695.24 okay , ami_da_2
A 695.24 back to our project . ami_da_4
A 697.74 the remote control we are going to develop will have a selling price of about twenty five Euros . ami_da_4
A 707.06 the profit we are looking for for this product is fifty million Euros , which is quite a number . ami_da_4
A 717.68 we we will focus this internationally , so the product will be sold , if there is market interest , in in more than one country . ami_da_4
A 729.48 And the production costs should not be more than twelve Euro fifty , ami_da_4
A 729.48 so we should keep that in mind by w w during the development , ami_da_6
A 729.48 because , well , those are important numbers . ami_da_9
A 744.75 then the discussion , ami_da_4
A 744.75 maybe the time for Sebastian to show his presentation . ami_da_6
C 750.8 Yes , I have some technical issues which I would like to present to you before we start the discussion , ami_da_7
C 750.8 because there might be some influations influences . ami_da_4
A 761.12 Limitations . ami_da_4
A 763.06 Okay . ami_da_9
B 763.82 Okay . ami_da_9
C 764.11 Okay ? ami_da_11
C 764.11 Okay . ami_da_2
A 764.56 Okay , great . ami_da_9
C 790.3 first about my role , role of the Industrial Designer . ami_da_4
C 794.85 I would like to think about the implementation of of things , and the technical possibilities and impossibilities . ami_da_4
C 803.72 So if someone of you comes up with ideas , I will try to translate them in technical functions , ami_da_7
C 803.72 but there might be some impossibilities . ami_da_4
C 815.01 So that is one . ami_da_4
C 816.51 I also will propose some some implementations for that , ami_da_7
C 816.51 but well , these are quite the same . ami_da_4
C 827.51 Sorry about that . ami_da_14
C 829.36 and I also will remind people of some new technical possibilities which are available ami_da_7
C 829.36 and which might be interesting to implement in our product . ami_da_4
B 838.58 Okay . ami_da_1
C 839.94 I have some initial ideas about some things ami_da_7
C 839.94 which are maybe nice to take with you in the upcoming discussion . ami_da_9
C 850.49 One thing about interopera operability . ami_da_4
C 853.88 I think a modern remote control should control a device diverse subset of equipment . ami_da_4
C 864.5 for instance , DVD players , cell phones , video and audio equipment . ami_da_4
C 869.28 So one re one remote control for all your equipment . ami_da_4
B 873.62 And for a cell phone ? ami_da_5
B 873.62 Yeah , okay . ami_da_9
C 875.41 Well , there should be some interoperabi interoperability between them . ami_da_4
B 880.93 Yeah . ami_da_9
C 881.11 I think it could come in handy . ami_da_9
C 882.9 We should discuss that . ami_da_6
C 884.62 and we should think about the way how these things should communicate with each other . ami_da_6
C 891.16 We are not living in the nineteen eighties anymore , so infrared is not is not really hot technical stuff anymore . ami_da_4
C 901.63 But you should think about the things like Bluetooth . ami_da_6
B 903.08 But ami_da_3
B 903.08 Yeah , but the infrared , it is , well , a little bit old fashioned , if you would call it like that . ami_da_9
C 910.16 But it is cost effective . ami_da_9
B 910.34 But all the TVs are equipped with infrared , so ami_da_4
B 910.34 y you ami_da_3
B 910.34 you can ami_da_3
B 910.34 Most of them . ami_da_9
C 912.18 Yes . ami_da_1
C 915.41 Well , not all , not all . ami_da_9
C 917.12 So that is the point . ami_da_9
C 918.36 So ami_da_3
C 918.36 Maybe , ami_da_9
C 918.36 but that is something we should discuss and about every everybody should think about it . ami_da_6
B 918.66 Or you shou sh use a ami_da_2
B 918.66 you should equip infrared and Bluetooth together in one remote . ami_da_6
B 925.36 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 929.29 So that is just my role , ami_da_4
C 929.29 I will just give you everybody some technical input , ami_da_7
C 929.29 and I think now the time is to have a little discussion about what the product should be and how it should look , but take these things into account when you start the discussion . ami_da_6
A 940.42 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 944.44 Okay , ami_da_9
A 944.44 so the the main por the main points you are telling us ami_da_4
A 944.44 are focus on the inter operability , ami_da_4
A 944.44 and ami_da_3
A 944.44 Okay , ami_da_9
A 944.44 and and ami_da_3
A 944.44 Okay . ami_da_9
C 952.07 Yes , ami_da_9
C 952.07 so one thing one remote control should control one or more pieces of equipment , and the way of communicating with these equipments . ami_da_4
A 962.55 Okay , good . ami_da_9
C 963.98 Okay . ami_da_9
A 964.55 that was your presentation ? ami_da_5
A 964.55 Okay , okay . ami_da_9
C 966.63 That is it . ami_da_4
A 969.27 okay . ami_da_2
A 973.31 Great . ami_da_2
A 973.75 I will go back to my own presentation . ami_da_7
A 985.65 Okay . ami_da_2
A 986.77 I I do think it is time now to to discuss some things . ami_da_6
A 992.96 Sebastian told us a few things about the technical implemen implications . ami_da_4
A 998.75 there are other things like how to make it trendy , which is I think most Ru Ruud is role . ami_da_4
A 1011.53 the way how it should be controlled by the user , which is Roo r during this part . ami_da_4
A 1020.78 so let is start with you . ami_da_6
A 1022.8 H how do you think the remote should function for the user ? ami_da_8
A 1022.8 Yep . ami_da_9
B 1027.14 Well , I had a few things in mind . ami_da_4
B 1032.15 well , the interoperability , just like Sebastian said , the remote should work on different TVs or even different ami_da_4
B 1032.15 Yeah , what is it , ami_da_5
B 1032.15 devices ? ami_da_4
B 1032.15 so i ami_da_2
B 1032.15 i ami_da_2
B 1032.15 I think it is a universal remote control for customers to buy just new in a store . ami_da_4
C 1057.03 Yes , I think it should be something like that . ami_da_9
B 1057.93 It is not for for for Philips or whatever to buy our remote for their own product , ami_da_4
B 1057.93 right ? ami_da_5
B 1057.93 Yeah , I do I do not know that . ami_da_4
A 1067.08 Okay , so we are we are going business to consumer , ami_da_9
A 1067.08 not we are we are it is not a ami_da_3
A 1067.08 No . ami_da_4
B 1072.23 It is no I have ami_da_2
B 1072.23 do not have the information for it . ami_da_4
C 1073.33 We are not developing this product for a specific vendor , are we ? ami_da_5
C 1073.33 No , ami_da_9
C 1073.33 we are just developing this product , and we want to sell it to a very broad public , so it should fit to every device . ami_da_4
A 1076.87 No . ami_da_4
B 1077.1 No , okay . ami_da_9
B 1082.37 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 1082.38 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 1084.09 Ruud , y do you agree ? ami_da_11
A 1084.09 Okay . ami_da_9
D 1085.38 Yeah , I think I think they are right , ami_da_9
D 1085.38 yeah . ami_da_9
A 1087.33 Okay . ami_da_9
B 1087.99 Well , the techni fu technical function what you said is just by pressing the button you should change the state of the TV . ami_da_4
B 1099.49 That is just the basic f technical function . ami_da_4
A 1102.34 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 1102.63 So that was my really my part for this session . ami_da_4
B 1105.88 Well , that is just the fu the technical function is pure what should the remote control do , wh what is his task as an as an device . ami_da_4
A 1107.27 So is that ease of use or is that more like ami_da_5
A 1107.27 Okay . ami_da_1
C 1107.71 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 1122.41 It just should change the TV is state . ami_da_4
B 1125.59 So that is it . ami_da_4
B 1127.32 but furthermore ami_da_3
B 1127.32 Yeah . ami_da_4
C 1128.2 And you you see the buttons as a as a means of doing this ? ami_da_5
C 1128.2 Or are there any o other controls ? ami_da_5
C 1128.2 Are there only any other cont ami_da_3
C 1128.2 Well , ami_da_2
C 1128.2 I I have seen these remote controls with this little stick which you can move forward , sidewords . ami_da_4
B 1133.08 Yeah , with buttons . ami_da_4
B 1134.86 Yeah , or maybe you want a touch screen or ami_da_4
B 1134.86 But ami_da_3
B 1134.86 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 1145.08 Uh huh . ami_da_1
C 1145.15 You know these things . ami_da_4
C 1146.35 And it is very easy for a user to to switch ami_da_4
C 1146.35 w yes , ami_da_9
C 1146.35 to to switch b between channels or change between tracks on a on a CD , on on a chapters , you know , on a DVD player . ami_da_4
B 1147.62 They are very vu vulnerable . ami_da_9
B 1150.45 Yeah . ami_da_9
C 1159.35 So maybe that is an idea , I do not know . ami_da_9
B 1161.1 Yeah . ami_da_9
B 1162.01 And for other user interface I had , well , it is more industrial thing . ami_da_4
B 1167.05 point at a TV ami_da_4
B 1167.05 , I think it is it is quite disturbing when you always have to point directly to the TV , ami_da_4
B 1167.05 so you must point everywhere , ami_da_6
B 1167.05 so maybe infrared is ami_da_3
B 1167.05 Yeah , just do not even point it , ami_da_9
B 1167.05 so in that case infrared should maybe be restriction to that . ami_da_6
C 1177.17 Okay . ami_da_1
A 1178.29 Maybe not even pointed . ami_da_6
A 1180.34 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 1186.47 Okay ami_da_1
A 1186.47 Okay , gentlemen , just a reminder , we d we have five minutes left for this meeting ami_da_4
A 1186.47 okay . ami_da_9
C 1186.96 is that ami_da_2
C 1186.96 are there restriction for the range , the operating range too ? ami_da_5
C 1186.96 So when you are not able to point at the device the range is very limited . ami_da_5
B 1195.16 Yeah , if you g if you go to radio or or yeah . ami_da_9
B 1198.17 For TV , you are always in in the neighbourhood of a TV , ami_da_4
B 1198.17 so I do not think think the range should be a problem to that , but if you want to get it working with a radio , and you are in outside your garden with just one speaker , then maybe the range should be ami_da_9
B 1198.17 But ami_da_3
B 1198.17 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 1215.86 Okay . ami_da_2
C 1220.43 Okay . ami_da_1
B 1222.45 Two more things . ami_da_7
B 1223.73 You should able to feel the buttons without it mis ami_da_2
B 1223.73 you have to know what you do without looking at the buttons , ami_da_4
B 1223.73 so it should be as user interface for feeling should be good to understand . ami_da_6
B 1243.94 You must feel the buttons for volume or whatever , I think . ami_da_6
A 1244.04 Okay , s yeah . ami_da_9
A 1248.64 Yeah . ami_da_9
B 1248.83 And of course you do not always know where all buttons are , ami_da_4
B 1248.83 so it should be visible al in dark too . ami_da_6
B 1256.22 So when it is dark ami_da_3
B 1256.22 Those are two really user interface ami_da_4
B 1256.22 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 1256.52 Okay . ami_da_9
A 1261.62 I will write down glow in the dark . ami_da_7
B 1264.16 That is perfect . ami_da_9
A 1264.17 Is tha ami_da_3
A 1264.17 Okay . ami_da_9
C 1265.46 Okay . ami_da_9
A 1266.62 Okay , I just want to hear Ruud is input for this meeting . ami_da_6
C 1266.72 Do do you ami_da_3
C 1266.72 well yes , I had , about three minutes ago , but I have seem to forget them forgot them . ami_da_4
A 1272.21 do you have anything already w ab idea about how the market will respond to the such a product ? ami_da_5
A 1272.21 Or what we should take in account when developing such a product ? ami_da_8
D 1283.22 I think most most things have already been said , like control multiple devices . ami_da_4
D 1291.0 And , yeah , infrared might be an issue . ami_da_4
A 1294.07 Because ? ami_da_5
D 1295.57 well , he said about n abo ami_da_2
D 1295.57 what he said about pointing . ami_da_4
D 1299.45 But lots of devices already use infrared . ami_da_4
D 1302.45 So we will probably have to implement that . ami_da_6
A 1305.94 Okay . ami_da_9
A 1308.92 Okay . ami_da_2
A 1317.95 Okay , Sebastian , did you have any other ideas ? ami_da_8
A 1317.95 Okay . ami_da_1
C 1327.36 oh yes , I remember . ami_da_4
C 1329.36 you said something about visibility in the dark . ami_da_4
C 1332.07 would it be nice for a user to have display on this remote control , on which you can see functions ? ami_da_6
C 1332.07 Which makes it easier to operate it . ami_da_4
B 1332.4 Yeah . ami_da_9
B 1344.64 Yeah . ami_da_9
B 1345.23 Well , maybe I ami_da_9
B 1345.23 but it it can be quite simple , you can just have white buttons with a black mark on it . ami_da_6
C 1347.84 I I do not know . ami_da_9
C 1352.27 Okay . ami_da_1
B 1352.99 The the the digits in black . ami_da_6
B 1355.36 then it is already visible in dark . ami_da_4
C 1357.87 Okay . ami_da_9
B 1358.03 So it it do not have to be a lightning or or a fancy well , it can be for design , of course . ami_da_4
C 1361.47 Okay . ami_da_1
A 1362.41 Yeah , ami_da_9
A 1362.41 yeah , ami_da_9
A 1362.41 okay , ami_da_9
A 1362.41 because because we wa we want to develop a trendy product . ami_da_4
C 1366.6 Yes , but there is a cost limitation too . ami_da_9
A 1367.06 So ami_da_3
A 1367.06 Yeah , ami_da_9
A 1367.06 twelve Euro fifty , ami_da_4
A 1367.06 yeah . ami_da_4
C 1368.9 Well , that is more ami_da_3
C 1368.9 So that is a big problem , I think . ami_da_9
C 1373.92 I think the the financial part of this project implicates that it is not going to be a high high end product . ami_da_4
C 1382.07 The cost price is very low . ami_da_4
A 1382.09 Okay . ami_da_9
C 1384.59 Okay . ami_da_9
B 1384.9 Just remind something . ami_da_7
B 1387.16 The digits of the the painting on the buttons should not fade . ami_da_6
A 1391.12 Okay , okay . ami_da_9
B 1391.51 You have a m ami_da_3
B 1391.51 Always have s the soft buttons , always clear the the the paint on it . ami_da_4
C 1391.85 Very good point . ami_da_9
C 1392.66 Yeah . ami_da_9
B 1400.07 The marks . ami_da_4
C 1400.24 Okay . ami_da_1
A 1402.72 Okay , ami_da_2
A 1402.72 I ami_da_7
A 1402.72 ha I have one point f ami_da_7
A 1402.72 which which comes in mind now . ami_da_7
A 1408.08 d I think the device should either be rechargeable very easily or it should not consume too much power . ami_da_6
C 1415.59 Okay . ami_da_9
A 1420.86 Because it is very annoying if you need to change the batteries every s every other week . ami_da_4
B 1426.29 Yeah . ami_da_9
C 1426.3 Okay . ami_da_9
A 1427.48 So ami_da_2
A 1427.48 maybe we could for example only light the buttons that are applicable at that moment or ami_da_6
A 1427.48 yeah . ami_da_9
B 1432.85 But ami_da_3
B 1432.85 Necessary , ami_da_9
B 1432.85 yeah . ami_da_9
A 1438.92 I dunno , ami_da_9
A 1438.92 it is ami_da_2
A 1438.92 that is more Sebastian is ami_da_4
A 1438.92 Well does it ? ami_da_5
A 1438.92 I am not sure . ami_da_9
B 1441.37 Yeah . ami_da_9
B 1442.29 But then Bluetooth might be problem . ami_da_9
B 1445.18 Because I think Bluetooth ami_da_4
B 1445.18 Yeah , ami_da_9
B 1445.18 I know it from the cell phone . ami_da_4
C 1446.63 It is use a lot of ami_da_4
C 1446.63 well ami_da_2
C 1446.63 Well , cell phones have integrated Bluetooth also and , well , it is it seems to work quite okay . ami_da_4
A 1449.97 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 1455.84 So technically it will be possible . ami_da_4
B 1456.37 But you ca not you ca not use Bluetooth all the time , twenty four hours a day . ami_da_4
C 1460.36 No , you cannot . ami_da_9
A 1460.42 Okay . ami_da_4
B 1460.8 Does it ami_da_3
B 1460.8 It is over ? ami_da_5
B 1460.8 Okay . ami_da_9
A 1461.62 Gentlemen , I am afraid we do not have any more time . ami_da_4
C 1463.11 Okay . ami_da_1
