Great man .
Alright , great .
Alright .
Okay .
I have put some new things in the in the map .
oh .
This is it .
I do not know the shortcut , so
F five .
Well our functional design meeting , that is the stage we are in .
And you also ha all three of you have prepared something about it .
Yes .
But
Kay .
I think you have prepared all three ?
we I dunno .
Well , yeah .
Yeah .
Y you also have received that mail , the new project requirements from our bosses ?
Oh I have received a mail with some additional requirements ,
because it is not really smart to to include some things we ca not , because of the new requirements .
No .
No .
You are the only one .
Oh .
Alright .
Kay .
We have forty minutes for this discussion ?
Alright .
yeah , I think so .
Well the closing we will not look at it yet .
Alright .
Well notes , first meeting .
Now .
I gave a disc a a presentation .
we familiarised ourself with the boards and then we discussed some first ideas .
So we said that we have to merge the strong points from our competitors , and look at their remote controls .
Right .
Huh ?
Yeah .
One recognisable button in the middle , where you do the most important functions with .
And well they can have two functions , because you have a DVD and a television .
the design has to fit the hand , be original , but also be familiar .
It is one of our ideas .
Yeah well that
wa
It is just thirty minutes ago ,
so it is not quite
But well I have to do it .
, now it is right .
Yeah .
The materials well should be hard plastic with rubber from , and well the labelling of the buttons should be indestructible .
It should be recognisable at all times .
It is meant to be easily wiped out , yeah .
Yes .
Okay .
Well fronts were to be just like mobile telephones .
And the technical aspects And also labelling of the buttons , the functions should be universal standards .
Well that is just some ideas from the first meeting .
It is quite logical al all of it .
I got this mail from our bosses .
Well , teletext goes out .
Oh .
We will not use teletext .
Okay .
I I disagree , but it is not t it is not my place to disagree
I guess .
Well
the second is a bit sh pity
because we just said we wanted to d include the DVD and they do not want it , because of our time we have for this project .
Oh .
Alright .
Oh , alright .
Oh , that is a shame .
So that is a shame ,
because especially for the third requirement we want to reach people under the thirty years .
Because we do not have those customers a lot at th at this point .
well it is a bit pity
because it is just those people want to have one remote control for all those technical devices they can reach it .
Yeah .
It is just time consuming ,
Yeah .
Well and our corporate image should stay rec recognisable in our products .
Yeah well on our remote controls the design has to be , well as we already said a actually , familiar .
Yes .
not only just the shape but also our company .
Yeah , we are a real fashionable company .
I read I read it on the
I did not know what company we were , but we we design especially trendy trendy trendy stuff .
Yeah .
Yeah .
Yeah .
Yeah .
So it has to be a modern design .
Okay .
That is important to know , when you design a thing of course .
Yes .
I
I noted our slogan that we have , our company .
It is we put the fashion in electronics .
Yeah .
Right .
Yeah .
Alright then we are going to have three presentations .
Yeah .
Oh you have to start ?
I did not see anything about who had to start .
Yeah .
Oh no , no problem .
The order ?
No .
I I just have to to think which file is mine , cause I was bit in a hurry .
Okay .
Well
You already opened PowerPoint .
I think it is this one .
But I am not sure .
Yeah .
S
Right .
Yes .
This is it .
Yeah .
because it is a smart thing to exclude those things .
, furthermore it is very important what they do like and what they do use .
Well , the first findings are that people think most controls are very kind of ug ugly .
That is seventy five per cent of the current users .
They do not like it ,
They also say , that is about I thought it was fifty per cent , that more money will be spent on better looking controls .
the current user uses his machine just about well all of the time for a few functions .
, almost every user uses it d the the control for just ten per cent of its capacity .
Furthermore , it is seventy five per cent of the users zaps a lot .
Yeah ,
yeah right .
Yeah .
Yeah .
Right .
A lot of losers users lose their controls in their in their living room .
Yeah .
I dunno , maybe that is an idea .
Well
because it can also be used for other televisions .
Cause it is a big I think fifty per cent of the users loses his its control , within the same room .
Oh .
Oh ? .
Yeah .
Yeah
but what if you lose your click on device ?
Yeah
Nee but it
it specifically says it is the the control is lost in the same room .
No
you can click it on your television .
Yeah in another room ,
yeah .
Well yes .
Yeah .
So
Well a beeping device would be
furthermore the learning time is a problem .
thirty four thirty four per cent thinks it is it is too too difficult to learn .
Yeah but people do not read manuals .
I did not read it ?
Oh , alright .
No .
No .
users to add one ?
Do you think ?
I do not think
Yeah .
Yes
Yeah alright .
Yep .
Because they do not use it ?
Alright .
Yeah .
Well there sh should always be a menu , but it c can be very short .
Right .
And it should be consistent with consistent with older remotes .
Yeah but nobody reads a manual about a remote control , I think .
Yes okay .
Is not it part of the of the u
No .
Alright .
Yeah right .
But but not to explain how the remote works .
Only
And we do not have much time .
Well we are a design team ,
Yeah right , right .
So
No .
Never mind .
yes ?
Yep .
RSI .
Well that is about twenty per cent I thought .
But the designer should take it should Wie zeg ik dat ?
Yeah , consider the consequences of using your remote .
Consider the m
Yeah .
It should be a good in your hand .
Right ,
this is the most important part .
, we are
Like the requirements said , we are going to specify of we are going to target a younger audience .
, that is about sixty per cent of the market , so it is quite important .
research shows that they like to have a little LCD screen on their on their zapping device .
I thought it was the age between sixteen and twenty , ninety nine per cent of the people like that .
Well
Well with twelve Euro fifty as production cost , we ca not afford an LCD
Yeah .
It is going to be expensive .
No .
Yeah .
Yeah but they think it is really important .
So if we want to s If we have a big
We have to
Yeah ,
I do not know .
Well
Nigh
I know .
We will think abo we will think
I do not have any information on that .
So
Right .
Alright ?
We have very demanding clients .
And another thing is speech recognition .
They also like that , but research is very costly .
I think that is difficult to realise also .
So
Yeah ,
but it
it might be important for the sale .
It is not yet a standard development those so
We sh
Yeah absolutely .
No
and we have customers in multiple countries I think .
Well I do think LCD is more reachable than the speech recognition .
Yeah .
So we might consider LCD screens .
Yeah , yeah , alright .
No .
Alright .
Yep .
We do not rule them out yet .
Kay .
Alright .
, I think that is it .
Alright .
Yes .
So you can
Right .
Well you
I c
I can still see your presentation .
Yeah .
Right .
It is in the
Well next I dunno who is next .
Yes .
Alright .
Oh you go .
Well it is my task to explain or to point out a working design .
Yip .
We have that here .
F F five .
F five .
F five .
Yep .
Alright .
Well , the working design ,
that is my
Well alright , you know who I am and what I do .
Next button .
So we have this .
It is a bit unclear
because I wanted to copy paste something .
It was originally in black and white but it became black and purple .
Oh right .
Purple .
But I think you can read it .
Yeah ,
yeah ,
yeah .
well I think it is important for you to realise the basic function of a remote control .
A bit .
well you can see
It goes to the next page .
So it inverts .
the p the whole picture .
Nah , never mind .
Well , you can read it ,
it is not too difficult .
Meanwhile , this is a schematic view of how a basic remote control works .
You have basically the energy , the power of the of the remote control , and the sender , w which is the LED , the the the the the the the the the bulb that sends the the infrared beam to the , no , to the set .
Yeah .
Alright .
And the source is of course the user .
the user interface is the the the buttons of course .
And the the user interface sends the the different signals of the different buttons to the chip , and the chip sends it to the LED , and the LED sends it to the receiver .
That is the that is the basic idea .
Yep .
Very basic .
well I have put it in a in in in a a couple of basic steps .
the remote is basically just waiting for a user to press a key .
It does nothing until of course the key is pressed .
The key a signal to a chip , the chip senses the connection .
and recognise the key .
So well you understand .
The chip produces Morse code , a specific code to indicate that specific button that is pressed , of course .
And it uses transistors in the in the remote control to amplify and to send that signal again to the to the LED , which is the bulb , of course .
Now the LED produces an infrared beam and signals the , well it is very simple , and signals the signals to the sensor on the TV set , and the TV set also recognises the the the signal , and performs the assigned task .
Yeah .
So it is also why we have to have a button that says I am now busy with a DVD if we had done that .
And a button for TV .
bu
Yeah , but we do not .
we
No no ,
but Yeah .
So
Well but but
Exactly .
well this is the basic function of a remote .
I have some couple of pictures here .
It is a very basic one .
And if we if we are going to add an an LCD screen to it , it wo not look anything like this , but This is very basic basically the the shape of of a remote control .
It has very little buttons and
But it it it is it is quite
Yeah , you can easily recognise the buttons .
They are far enough apart and an anything .
It is not very not very high tech
indeed , and it is not very user friendly .
High tech .
if you look at the shape , it is just a simple long box shape .
so that it becomes more user friendly , and that problems like RSI and those kinds of thing do not do not oc do not occur .
Right .
I have a table here about the l the relevance of the buttons .
Yeah .
the power button is used very much , channel selection , volume and teletext .
Well teletext is not an option , so that
Yeah ,
because they are the the most important buttons
and you can immediately
You do not have to look and and search for them .
Right .
You can also like Yeah , I was thinking you can Are some of the the the
Right .
Yeah , right .
But if y if you would put it at a different place , then you have to move your hands , and that is on of the things about RSI .
Right .
Yeah , that is right .
That is right .
That is right .
Well you you ca not have any every button under the thumb , of course .
We But
Yeah .
No
so you would reject R RSI RSI .
That is very important .
And
But is that is that useable ?
Do people , when they pick up a remote , know that they have to do that ?
It is a f it is a new feature ,
Well Yeah alright , but
Yeah ,
, they they will understand it , I think .
Yes
I have saw that on m on mi mobile telephones they also have those buttons .
Well it it is
Well also
i if someone puts picks up his remote
Yeah .
Yeah .
Eighty per cent would .
Well , .
If someone puts up i picks up his remote , and he picks up it
he he touches the side
then he is a already on the next channel .
Yeah , he feels it immediately .
Yeah that is true .
That is very irritating , I think .
Yeah , that is right .
Yeah .
Yeah
but
Sorry .
I think that is a good idea ,
two three four five as well , should be
yeah
well not in reach ,
because they do not use it all the time .
Well it is pretty pretty basically as you said .
Yep .
And I have some pictures of the inside workings , but I do not want to get too technical , because that is not very useful for you .
Yeah , that is right .
That is your part of the job .
So yeah exactly
this is how it looks from the inside .
Yep .
And well that is about it I think .
Oh yeah , I still have this .
Oh I had to delete this , but I had to make a schematic of the of the new
But I had too too little time , but do not do not look at it please .
Alright .
Okay .
Well we understand .
Alright .
I I think it is it is clear how it works .
We understand .
Yeah , it is clear .
Alright .
Oh right , no .
That is the most important thing .
Nice .
Alright .
Right .
How late is did we start his presentation ?
Wha
Yeah .
I dunno .
I think w About twenty minutes ago ?
Losing time losing time .
Well then we have still the time ,
Yeah right .
So
I do not think so .
So
Oh yeah ? ?
Okay ,
yeah
well .
Well I thought everybody on the website would see the same thing , but obviously that is not the case .
Yeah ,
there are different
We have all have different home pages , with different links .
Yeah .
Yeah .
Yeah right .
For instance you could not see this .
Yeah .
Well I am Mike , User Interface Designer .
The the method ?
Well I used my own experience with remotes , took a good l look at the remotes on the corporate website , which are these two .
Yeah .
Yes , these are from from another manufacturer .
These are already in use ?
Alright , okay .
This one is engineering centred , so this one has the most functions and things .
Yeah .
I like user centr centred also the best .
Well
Yeah , me too .
I like user centred .
Yeah .
We also do that .
so I thought we we we would use more or need more buttons than this one .
But we have to reject that , because of the requirements ?
Alright .
But
Yes .
Yeah .
Th that is why this is not relevant any more I feel .
I think this is about the maximum number of buttons we will need .
Yeah , right .
I I kind of like the shape .
I think this is what we talked about .
But
No
I have
Well I showed it somewhere .
Yeah .
You ca not really see the differ from different sides .
But I think
you can draw it if you
Yeah .
Oh yeah .
Yeah .
Well absolutely ,
So we cannot just make someone w
No
but that is th the side they look look at is the front .
It is a front .
It is not the the whole remote that changes , of course .
But it
You can
So if y if you make a a front with just a a tiger on it , then our recognition is totally gone .
Yeah , that is right
Yeah , that is a must .
So l like Ericsson does every S something like this .
We must have that .
Yeah , we must .
Yeah well and and
Yes .
It is recognisable .
Kay .
Yeah ?
Yeah yeah .
And if you put a front on it , there is a hole on the front .
So the symbol is always on
Yeah .
Yeah , so that you do not replace the symbol , yeah .
Yeah
yeah
yeah .
Something like that ,
in the Yeah .
Yeah ,
yeah .
Yeah .
Those kind of things .
Yes .
Okay .
Well so like I said I thought we would we would use more function .
If we we had to include more functions .
But we do not .
So Yeah .
Alright .
Maybe some less .
I think
In Map ?
The younger
I think for the remote less is more .
The less buttons the better the design .
Yeah .
Yeah , I agree .
I know .
Alright .
Yeah ?
Well what if we
I at I at home have a remote that has the most familiar buttons on the top , and the bottom side of the front has a little clip ,
a f a little
You can click away and then you have f much more functions that most people do not use
but s some do do .
there are two target audi audiences , and we have chose for the younger one .
, research has shown that it is a high interested in features .
They are high high interested in feature .
But they are more critical .
Fo
Yeah , critical .
So
The younger audience .
I think the most functions underneath that
No
usually But Yeah I think m most Most
Clip are not used much .
Well but because you say they their features are important , they want m a lot ,
but not
Yeah .
Yeah right .
Yeah ,
but what kind of features ?
Like LCD screens and voice recognition .
Yeah
but Yeah .
But I have
Yeah , that is nice .
The newest features are , like I said , are LCD and speech control .
Our audience , these people , are very like these features .
You see ?
So we must build in something , or they will to go to the concurrent .
Yeah .
The concurrent ?
Competitors , right .
Our competitor .
Competitors .
Yeah .
So , I do think we have to have some features .
Yeah .
Even though they cost a little more .
Well maybe w we could s
On some calculators you have lo those little little LCD th that you can click on or something , or that you can click out of the remote .
Right .
Right .
And if if that is gives you a little bit of sta status information .
Like a ticker tape .
Yeah .
Which programme you are l watching or something .
Those kind of things ,
because you also have those those program recognition for your V VCRs .
Yeah , right .
Yeah .
Yeah right .
Yeah .
Yeah .
For example .
Yeah ,
But should it really be clickable ,
It will
No ,
it should be integrated .
Yeah .
No not clickable .
Well maybe .
Nah , no no no .
I think
Yeah ,
Yeah ,
So when you s you sit like this you can can watch .
Yeah .
Yeah .
You
Where it is , yeah , walking to
Yeah .
Yeah right .
It is a ticker tape idea .
But that is of course a bit more expensive than the basic calculator design , with the scrolling text and that kind of thing .
Wa Yeah .
Well it is just one script .
Well I think it is you got
It just means it is a script that is keeps it rolling , and it is not That is five minutes off implementing time I think
Yeah .
Yeah , five minutes of ja ja for programming .
So I do not think that is the issue .
No .
Alright .
Alright , we go with the LCD screen ?
Kay .
well I think so , yes .
Yeah well we we we still need to know how much that will cost .
We are g
No
Right ,
I do not know if I can find that , but
Next time .
Or maybe you will get that information
Yeah .
Yeah right .
Where is my presentation ?
Well
I mean we are all here now , I think .
Yeah , I understand what you are saying .
These I have already given you .
Right .
At the top .
The LCD screen alright
Huh ?
And then
At the top or at the bottom ?
Yeah
but
Yeah but with with the LCD screen on the top it gets a bit unnatural .
Yes .
I think the top is more
When you s How do you zap ?
You just sit in your chair ?
With the remote ?
Yeah but that is where your hand ball might be .
Yeah .
That thing is terrible .
Cause most remotes have some space left at the bottom .
Well
Well I th
I think Mike Mike has a point ,
because when when when I use a remote
I
l
I hate the buttons but buttons at the at the bottom .
Yeah , I dunno .
Yeah , no .
No he thinks
Yeah , right .
I dunno what you were talking about but we are busy with something .
He thinks it is better to put the LCD at the bottom , and I think it is better at the top .
Uh huh .
Why do you think it is better at the bottom ?
so that there is room for the for the interface .
well because most remotes have some space left at the bottom , and that way you can keep the shape recognisable for everybody .
But your
Yeah .
I c
Well I d I think that is that is ugly but
I th
Yeah .
The the ticker The LCD is like like small .
It is it is wide .
It is not not high .
Uh huh .
But
Yeah right .
And and we can
Bottom .
Power button always
Yeah .
Yeah .
So and
and I
I like to use the ones on the top .
Yeah , y you gotta zap like this
or you want to
Yeah .
So when I u when I have to have an LCD s scr window
Yes
but we we we
we do not want that .
But We are making a remote with with a few functions you know .
Well that is a bit exaggerated .
Well , I agree with you .
It is it is also more recognisable .
We High tech .
It looks more like a calculator to people , if you have the l the the the thing on top .
Yeah you do not want
You want
Yeah
it it
it must be a remote .
We want to look it like our original but familiar
Yea
Width .
Yeah w well ,
because I think it is
I think it is still important to have it at the top , because it is it is more familiar that way .
Yeah .
Width .
format
yeah format ?
Line width ?
Width ?
Yeah ?
It is a bit off .
Th that is not a problem .
When I draw here it
Oh .
Huh ?
Yeah , it is off .
Well .
A little a little bit .
It is special pen .
Well
Where ?
Maybe that is better .
You e you only have one pen for that screen .
Yeah .
Yeah .
No .
I think we have a few functions , and we can put the LCD above it , and still have lots of room at the bottom , where you can put your hand .
Yeah .
I I agree .
Well I am the I
I am the designer , so
Yeah .
At the bottom ?
In a few minutes
Oh yeah ,
oh yeah , I totally agree .
Bottom .
The LCD .
At the bot
So
We are two VS two .
Yeah .
Yeah .
He is the boss .
Right .
Great .
we we were busy with that .
Because we have to decide this .
Yeah .
So , we have the power button .
Yes .
It is your it is your job .
Yeah of course .
it is .
No it is our job .
Yeah .
Well we have a power button .
W wh
While you have to agree , I can say it is like this
and you must agree .
Guys ?
Guys ?
We have a power button , setting buttons , LCD window , the number buttons
Yes .
For all of us I think .
Yeah , right .
Yeah .
The ten numbers ?
Yeah ?
Volume ?
Yeah , in circle , you know ?
And and a volume control also in it .
Channel ,
yeah .
Volume control .
the mute button .
Uh huh .
I h love that one .
Yes .
Yeah .
Yeah
yeah
yeah .
Well that is that is also design .
Yes .
Right .
Well h ho
Yes .
Yeah .
But th th on this remote th these controls are for something else , a DVD player or something .
Yes .
Yes ,
They are for some video
Apart .
So
Yeah ,
it is it is also not good to completely stay in one position constantly with one hand .
Yeah .
Yeah , but what he said about RSI was t kind of true .
When when you put them all in the same place , the most used buttons , you are doing the same thing all the time , and that is just what RSI is all about .
So people have to move their hand .
And they get less complaints of RSI .
Y
Yeah .
That is what I always do , because all my i important buttons are the same place .
It is good to move from time to time .
Yeah .
Yeah but people do not like it when their buttons are all over the place .
Frequency of button use .
Yes ?
Well not
Yes .
No but now y
channels are most is most used within the hour .
Uh huh .
Volume hardly .
You can see .
No I do not think .
Oh .
Up and down far apart from each other ?
Well not too much .
Far apart ?
You
thinking about RSI ?
Yeah
but Yeah
but
No .
Nei not too much , but Nei nei
nei
n I I totally agree .
The other the other two frustrations are far more important .
So Well they are used four times an hour , so Power bu button should be left at the top .
Well for example the power button ,
you can
If someone is constantly z zapping , it is not going to miss , that it that the power button is not right beside it .
Because I have someone
But the buttons is way .
So that one can be put away .
But just
Yeah .
Right .
Yeah .
I agree .
The power button can be
Yes .
Yeah .
Oh man ,
five minutes .
Yeah ,
well five minutes left .
Yep .
The most important things we have to
Well I have it here .
C c can you make you make
it it does not work well
but But it it would be pretty pretty nice if we could just draw a simple thing .
Yeah well that is going to take too too much time .
and ready .
Yes .
Yeah .
Yes .
Alright .
Well the LCD .
you are Industrial , you are User Interface .
So I think it is going to go to Mike .
Yeah .
But you will have to make consensus with .
Well
Well it is a bit hard ,
because we are going to be individually .
Alright .
Nei .
We are No
We are deciding now , so
Top or bottom ?
Okay .
That is a bit
Yes .
Well yeah I
I still think it is it is quite important though to to have it at the top , so
Yeah .
Yes it is .
You say familiarity is not important but
Yeah d
Yeah .
Plus the d th the design round is still to come huh ?
Alright these functions .
Yeah , right .
Okay .
As we we we we agreed , we do have a LCD .
The number f
Well yes , that is alright .
So that is that is enough .
Yeah , okay .
W the number function .
Yeah .
How do you want it to do then ?
No .
There is one two three four five six six seven eight nine zero .
Well just when you push a one one and
No ,
if you
On most TVs if you press two numbers shortly after each other , d it
Yeah .
Oh , like that .
They would recognise it .
Yes .
Th that is the most
That that is very easy .
Alright so no button for that .
Yeah .
Yeah .
No .
Yeah .
Okay anyone any oth other functionalities of our remote ?
So
No ,
we would just said we did not
Well
well because we ca not integrate it with any other remotes , all those buttons on those pictures are irrelevant .
I think these are the the most important functions .
Do you still have the pictures over there ?
Yeah , that is about it .
Yeah .
You do need the multi Or did
No , like this one .
You do need them ?
Yeah , I know .
But are we
Alright , alright
Now okay .
Right .
So just for a television is
that all we need ?
Teletext is gone .
Yeah , it is most useable this way .
Yeah .
basic function .
So all those buttons that ar are to do with teletext
Oh screen placing .
We will have those buttons about
And the two important ones we are l f forgetting .
there is screen .
Yeah .
Right .
Oh yeah .
Those two ?
But it is just two , and we make a clip ?
Th that is a bit waste .
just two just two under under I
I think
Yes .
Yeah .
Okay , right .
Your LCD screen is going to go .
Or at
Yeah alright then .
that is that is too complicated .
Yes .
