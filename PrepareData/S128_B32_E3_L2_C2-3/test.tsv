1	Great man .
2	Who starts ?
3	Alright , great .
4	Well I will start just with another presentation ,
5	so then we can look at th at the agenda for this meeting .
6	Alright .
7	Okay .
8	I have put some new things in the in the map .
9	oh .
10	This is it .
11	I do not know the shortcut , so
12	F five .
13	Well our functional design meeting , that is the stage we are in .
14	And you also ha all three of you have prepared something about it .
15	Yes .
16	Well in we will just have a look at the at the notes from the previous meeting , what we thought we had dec decided .
17	But
18	then we will look at the three presentations from you .
19	Kay .
20	I think you have prepared all three ?
21	we will look at th the new project requirements
22	we I dunno .
23	Well , yeah .
24	Yeah .
25	Y you also have received that mail , the new project requirements from our bosses ?
26	Oh I have received a mail with some additional requirements ,
27	and I will have a look if
28	Well I think we should show them before your presentations ,
29	because it is not really smart to to include some things we ca not , because of the new requirements .
30	No .
31	No .
32	You are the only one .
33	Oh .
34	Alright .
35	Kay .
36	Well then we can make some decisions about our remote control functions .
37	We have to deb we have to decide it in this meeting what our function will be .
38	And then we can discuss some more closely .
39	We have forty minutes for this discussion ?
40	Alright .
41	yeah , I think so .
42	Well the closing we will not look at it yet .
43	Alright .
44	now I will look at show this board .
45	Well notes , first meeting .
46	Now .
47	I gave a disc a a presentation .
48	we familiarised ourself with the boards and then we discussed some first ideas .
49	So we said that we have to merge the strong points from our competitors , and look at their remote controls .
50	Right .
51	We should make it compatible with our new DVD and other releases we have , our technical releases .
52	Huh ?
53	Yeah .
54	not too many one buttons .
55	One recognisable button in the middle , where you do the most important functions with .
56	And well they can have two functions , because you have a DVD and a television .
57	the design has to fit the hand , be original , but also be familiar .
58	It is one of our ideas .
59	Yeah well that
60	wa
61	It is just thirty minutes ago ,
62	so it is not quite
63	But well I have to do it .
64	, now it is right .
65	Yeah .
66	The materials well should be hard plastic with rubber from , and well the labelling of the buttons should be indestructible .
67	It should be recognisable at all times .
68	It is meant to be easily wiped out , yeah .
69	Yes .
70	Okay .
71	Well fronts were to be just like mobile telephones .
72	And the technical aspects And also labelling of the buttons , the functions should be universal standards .
73	Well that is just some ideas from the first meeting .
74	It is quite logical al all of it .
75	now the new project requirements , I will just show them .
76	I got this mail from our bosses .
77	Well , teletext goes out .
78	Oh .
79	We will not use teletext .
80	Okay .
81	Maybe a new sort of thing , but n but not teletext .
82	I I disagree , but it is not t it is not my place to disagree
83	I guess .
84	Well
85	the second is a bit sh pity
86	because we just said we wanted to d include the DVD and they do not want it , because of our time we have for this project .
87	Oh .
88	Alright .
89	Oh , alright .
90	Oh , that is a shame .
91	So that is a shame ,
92	because especially for the third requirement we want to reach people under the thirty years .
93	Because we do not have those customers a lot at th at this point .
94	well it is a bit pity
95	because it is just those people want to have one remote control for all those technical devices they can reach it .
96	Yeah .
97	But let is forget about it .
98	It is just time consuming ,
99	so we have to go on .
100	Yeah .
101	Well and our corporate image should stay rec recognisable in our products .
102	So we have to use maybe a slogan , maybe a colour , and
103	Yeah well on our remote controls the design has to be , well as we already said a actually , familiar .
104	Yes .
105	not only just the shape but also our company .
106	Yeah , we are a real fashionable company .
107	I read I read it on the
108	I did not know what company we were , but we we design especially trendy trendy trendy stuff .
109	Yeah .
110	Yeah .
111	Yeah .
112	Yeah .
113	So it has to be a modern design .
114	Okay .
115	That is important to know , when you design a thing of course .
116	Yes .
117	I
118	I noted our slogan that we have , our company .
119	It is we put the fashion in electronics .
120	Yeah .
121	Right .
122	So maybe that is a slogan we can put somewhere on our remote control or something .
123	Yeah .
124	Alright then we are going to have three presentations .
125	Yeah .
126	You want to start ?
127	Oh you have to start ?
128	I did not see anything about who had to start .
129	Yeah .
130	I think I have to start .
131	Oh no , no problem .
132	The order ?
133	No .
134	Well s then start .
135	I I just have to to think which file is mine , cause I was bit in a hurry .
136	Okay .
137	Well
138	You already opened PowerPoint .
139	I think it is this one .
140	But I am not sure .
141	Yeah .
142	S
143	Right .
144	Yes .
145	This is it .
146	Yeah .
147	Well , I am going to tell you something about functional requirements .
148	to start with these points .
149	next sheet ?
150	at first I tell you something about what people dislike about the current controls ,
151	because it is a smart thing to exclude those things .
152	, furthermore it is very important what they do like and what they do use .
153	then I tell something about the most important issues .
154	So we have to focus on those three thing three things .
155	And in the end I will show you our target audience or our target product users , customers .
156	Well , the first findings are that people think most controls are very kind of ug ugly .
157	That is seventy five per cent of the current users .
158	They do not like it ,
159	so we might think about fronts in that section .
160	They also say , that is about I thought it was fifty per cent , that more money will be spent on better looking controls .
161	So it is very important that you design a a nice looking control .
162	the current user uses his machine just about well all of the time for a few functions .
163	, almost every user uses it d the the control for just ten per cent of its capacity .
164	So it is really important to make the the buttons for the common tasks kind of big or kind of flashy .
165	Furthermore , it is seventy five per cent of the users zaps a lot .
166	Thus it might be might be smart to make a a big zapping button or something in the middle , so you can reach it with your thumb .
167	You can zap away .
168	Yeah ,
169	yeah right .
170	Yeah .
171	Yeah .
172	Right .
173	A lot of losers users lose their controls in their in their living room .
174	So it might be sensible to make some kind of a button on your television , that is your your control beeps or something , that you can find this very easily .
175	Yeah .
176	I dunno , maybe that is an idea .
177	Well
178	It should actually It should actually be loose from the television ,
179	because it can also be used for other televisions .
180	Cause it is a big I think fifty per cent of the users loses his its control , within the same room .
181	Oh .
182	Oh ? .
183	Yeah .
184	Yeah
185	but what if you lose your click on device ?
186	Yeah
187	but if someone d somebody else uses it in ano other room or something ?
188	Nee but it
189	it specifically says it is the the control is lost in the same room .
190	So if you deliver a small click on device that you can put on your television , that bleeps to your remote control , everyone can use it .
191	No
192	you can click it on your television .
193	Yeah in another room ,
194	yeah .
195	Well yes .
196	Yeah .
197	So
198	Well a beeping device would be
199	furthermore the learning time is a problem .
200	Well we will have a look at it , yeah .
201	thirty four thirty four per cent thinks it is it is too too difficult to learn .
202	So the the learning curve should be very short for the dumbest people should be able to use it .
203	I think our user expert should also consider manual a manual for the remote , of course .
204	Yeah but people do not read manuals .
205	I did not read it ?
206	Oh , alright .
207	No .
208	No .
209	users to add one ?
210	Do you think ?
211	I do not think
212	Yeah .
213	I think you should put more time in the in the design of pick up and use , than a manual .
214	Yes
215	you should You should could take a look at it and and and know how it how it is supposed to work .
216	Yeah alright .
217	Yep .
218	Because they do not use it ?
219	Alright .
220	Yeah .
221	Well there sh should always be a menu , but it c can be very short .
222	Right .
223	And it should be consistent with consistent with older remotes .
224	Yeah but nobody reads a manual about a remote control , I think .
225	Yes okay .
226	Well maybe for the If you do not recognise a button who d who d who do I call wh when I do not know it ?
227	Is not it part of the of the u
228	No .
229	Alright .
230	Yeah right .
231	It sh it should be there , the manual .
232	But but not to explain how the remote works .
233	Only
234	And we do not have much time .
235	So it is better to put our attention to the the design .
236	So you can pick up and use it , than I think .
237	Well we are a design team ,
238	we can say to some writer make a manual point .
239	Yeah right , right .
240	So
241	Well we will have a look .
242	No .
243	Never mind .
244	Next point .
245	yes ?
246	Yep .
247	RSI .
248	Well that is about twenty per cent I thought .
249	But the designer should take it should Wie zeg ik dat ?
250	Yeah , consider the consequences of using your remote .
251	Consider the m
252	Yeah .
253	It should be a good in your hand .
254	Right ,
255	this is the most important part .
256	, we are
257	Like the requirements said , we are going to specify of we are going to target a younger audience .
258	, that is about sixty per cent of the market , so it is quite important .
259	research shows that they like to have a little LCD screen on their on their zapping device .
260	I thought it was the age between sixteen and twenty , ninety nine per cent of the people like that .
261	Well
262	Well with twelve Euro fifty as production cost , we ca not afford an LCD
263	Yeah .
264	So it is very important we should definitely have that in our designs .
265	It is going to be expensive .
266	No .
267	Yeah .
268	Yeah but they think it is really important .
269	So if we want to s If we have a big
270	If we make lots of of the stuff , maybe we can buy it very cheap , I dunno .
271	We have to
272	Yeah ,
273	I do not know .
274	Well we will consider it .
275	Well
276	Yeah well it is your your task to look into the costs of those
277	Nigh
278	I know .
279	We will think abo we will think
280	No , we will look we will look into that later .
281	I do not have any information on that .
282	So
283	Right .
284	Alright ?
285	We have very demanding clients .
286	And another thing is speech recognition .
287	They also like that , but research is very costly .
288	I think that is difficult to realise also .
289	So
290	Yeah ,
291	but it
292	it might be important for the sale .
293	It is not yet a standard development those so
294	We sh
295	Yeah absolutely .
296	No
297	and we have customers in multiple countries I think .
298	Well I do think LCD is more reachable than the speech recognition .
299	Yeah .
300	So we might consider LCD screens .
301	Yeah , yeah , alright .
302	Well we will consider both and and see what what what we can find , I think .
303	No .
304	Alright .
305	Yep .
306	We do not rule them out yet .
307	Kay .
308	Alright .
309	, I think that is it .
310	I think it is sensible to u to take this take these points into the notes .
311	Alright .
312	Yes .
313	So you can
314	Right .
315	Well you
316	I c
317	I can still see your presentation .
318	Yeah .
319	Right .
320	It is in the
321	Well next I dunno who is next .
322	Yes .
323	Shall I give a technical talk ?
324	Alright .
325	Oh you go .
326	Well go ahead .
327	Well it is my task to explain or to point out a working design .
328	Yip .
329	We have that here .
330	Okay , how do you enlarge it , so that you can have the
331	F F five .
332	F five .
333	F five .
334	Yep .
335	Alright .
336	Well , the working design ,
337	that is my
338	Well alright , you know who I am and what I do .
339	Next button .
340	So we have this .
341	It is a bit unclear
342	because I wanted to copy paste something .
343	It was originally in black and white but it became black and purple .
344	Oh right .
345	Purple .
346	But I think you can read it .
347	Yeah ,
348	yeah ,
349	yeah .
350	well I think it is important for you to realise the basic function of a remote control .
351	A bit .
352	well you can see
353	And I then can select I can select on the dings
354	It goes to the next page .
355	Maybe you can select it .
356	So it inverts .
357	the p the whole picture .
358	Nah , never mind .
359	Click .
360	Well , you can read it ,
361	it is not too difficult .
362	Yeah , go ahead .
363	Meanwhile , this is a schematic view of how a basic remote control works .
364	You have basically the energy , the power of the of the remote control , and the sender , w which is the LED , the the the the the the the the the bulb that sends the the infrared beam to the , no , to the set .
365	Yeah .
366	Alright .
367	And the source is of course the user .
368	the user interface is the the the buttons of course .
369	And the the user interface sends the the different signals of the different buttons to the chip , and the chip sends it to the LED , and the LED sends it to the receiver .
370	That is the that is the basic idea .
371	Yep .
372	Very basic .
373	well I have put it in a in in in a a couple of basic steps .
374	the remote is basically just waiting for a user to press a key .
375	It does nothing until of course the key is pressed .
376	The key a signal to a chip , the chip senses the connection .
377	and recognise the key .
378	So well you understand .
379	The chip produces Morse code , a specific code to indicate that specific button that is pressed , of course .
380	And it uses transistors in the in the remote control to amplify and to send that signal again to the to the LED , which is the bulb , of course .
381	Now the LED produces an infrared beam and signals the , well it is very simple , and signals the signals to the sensor on the TV set , and the TV set also recognises the the the signal , and performs the assigned task .
382	Yeah .
383	So it is also why we have to have a button that says I am now busy with a DVD if we had done that .
384	And a button for TV .
385	bu
386	Yeah , but we do not .
387	we
388	No no ,
389	but Yeah .
390	So
391	Well but but
392	if you have the most used buttons all in one place , and you keep making the same well moves .
393	Exactly .
394	well this is the basic function of a remote .
395	I have some couple of pictures here .
396	It is a very basic one .
397	And if we if we are going to add an an LCD screen to it , it wo not look anything like this , but This is very basic basically the the shape of of a remote control .
398	It has very little buttons and
399	But it it it is it is quite
400	Yeah , you can easily recognise the buttons .
401	They are far enough apart and an anything .
402	It is not very not very high tech
403	indeed , and it is not very user friendly .
404	High tech .
405	if you look at the shape , it is just a simple long box shape .
406	So we have to change a little bit to that ,
407	so that it becomes more user friendly , and that problems like RSI and those kinds of thing do not do not oc do not occur .
408	Right .
409	Can I say something ?
410	I have a table here about the l the relevance of the buttons .
411	Yeah .
412	the power button is used very much , channel selection , volume and teletext .
413	Well teletext is not an option , so that
414	But I think it is very important to make the power , channel and volume buttons near to the thumb , so you ca not have RSI consequences .
415	Yeah ,
416	because they are the the most important buttons
417	and you can immediately
418	You do not have to look and and search for them .
419	Right .
420	Make them big , make them easy to to press .
421	You can also like Yeah , I was thinking you can Are some of the the the
422	Maybe you can make , for for channel changing , two little buttons on the side of the remote , so you can just do like this .
423	Right .
424	Yeah , right .
425	But if y if you would put it at a different place , then you have to move your hands , and that is on of the things about RSI .
426	Right .
427	Yeah , that is right .
428	That is right .
429	That is right .
430	Well you you ca not have any every button under the thumb , of course .
431	We But
432	Yeah .
433	No
434	but the most important buttons m maybe you can just put them a bit apart
435	so you would reject R RSI RSI .
436	That is very important .
437	And
438	But is that is that useable ?
439	Do people , when they pick up a remote , know that they have to do that ?
440	It is a f it is a new feature ,
441	you can make make a double feature l like a button on the top and under it .
442	Like some little Gameboy things or some
443	Well Yeah alright , but
444	Yeah ,
445	but if you s say them up and down
446	, they they will understand it , I think .
447	Yes
448	I have saw that on m on mi mobile telephones they also have those buttons .
449	Well it it is
450	Well also
451	i if someone puts picks up his remote
452	Yeah .
453	Yeah .
454	Eighty per cent would .
455	Well , .
456	If someone puts up i picks up his remote , and he picks up it
457	he he touches the side
458	then he is a already on the next channel .
459	Yeah , he feels it immediately .
460	Yeah that is true .
461	That is very irritating , I think .
462	Yeah , that is right .
463	Yeah .
464	Yeah
465	but
466	Right , continue .
467	Sorry .
468	But in e in any case the the basic function should be indeed , and as you say at the thumb .
469	I think that is a good idea ,
470	and and that the less important buttons , like the the the different channels , the numbers one
471	two three four five as well , should be
472	yeah
473	well not in reach ,
474	because they do not use it all the time .
475	Well it is pretty pretty basically as you said .
476	Yep .
477	And I have some pictures of the inside workings , but I do not want to get too technical , because that is not very useful for you .
478	Yeah , that is right .
479	That is your part of the job .
480	So yeah exactly
481	this is how it looks from the inside .
482	Yep .
483	And well that is about it I think .
484	Oh yeah , I still have this .
485	Oh I had to delete this , but I had to make a schematic of the of the new
486	But I had too too little time , but do not do not look at it please .
487	Alright .
488	Okay .
489	Well we understand .
490	Alright .
491	I I think it is it is clear how it works .
492	We understand .
493	Yeah , it is clear .
494	Alright .
495	Oh right , no .
496	That is the most important thing .
497	Nice .
498	Alright .
499	Then Mike can give the third presentation .
500	Right .
501	How late is did we start his presentation ?
502	Wha
503	Yeah .
504	I dunno .
505	I think w About twenty minutes ago ?
506	Losing time losing time .
507	Well then we have still the time ,
508	so But we do have to come to a decision , right later on .
509	Yeah right .
510	So
511	I do not think so .
512	So
513	Oh yeah ? ?
514	Okay ,
515	yeah
516	well .
517	Well I thought everybody on the website would see the same thing , but obviously that is not the case .
518	Yeah ,
519	there are different
520	We have all have different home pages , with different links .
521	Yeah .
522	Yeah .
523	Yeah right .
524	For instance you could not see this .
525	Yeah .
526	Well I am Mike , User Interface Designer .
527	The the method ?
528	Well I used my own experience with remotes , took a good l look at the remotes on the corporate website , which are these two .
529	Yeah .
530	Yes , these are from from another manufacturer .
531	These are already in use ?
532	Alright , okay .
533	This one is engineering centred , so this one has the most functions and things .
534	Yeah .
535	I like user centr centred also the best .
536	Well
537	Yeah , me too .
538	I like user centred .
539	Yeah .
540	We also do that .
541	Well , I thought that we reduce the the option to control the DVD also , and teletext and that kind of stuff .
542	so I thought we we we would use more or need more buttons than this one .
543	But we have to reject that , because of the requirements ?
544	Alright .
545	But
546	Yes .
547	Yeah .
548	Th that is why this is not relevant any more I feel .
549	I think this is about the maximum number of buttons we will need .
550	Yeah , right .
551	I I kind of like the shape .
552	I think this is what we talked about .
553	But
554	No
555	I have
556	Well I showed it somewhere .
557	Yeah .
558	You ca not really see the differ from different sides .
559	But I think
560	you can draw it if you
561	Yeah .
562	Oh yeah .
563	I think we should go further with the idea of a removable front .
564	So we can can yeah customise the
565	Yeah .
566	Well absolutely ,
567	but i th they all have to have something about the recognition from our company .
568	So we cannot just make someone w
569	No
570	but that is th the side they look look at is the front .
571	It is a front .
572	It is not the the whole remote that changes , of course .
573	But it
574	You can
575	So if y if you make a a front with just a a tiger on it , then our recognition is totally gone .
576	Or you can you can can put the same symbol on on every remote .
577	Yeah , that is right
578	Yeah , that is a must .
579	So l like Ericsson does every S something like this .
580	We must have that .
581	Yeah , we must .
582	We can put it on the on the back side .
583	Yeah well and and
584	Yes .
585	It is recognisable .
586	Kay .
587	We can make a symbol of the company right here .
588	Yeah ?
589	Yeah yeah .
590	And if you put a front on it , there is a hole on the front .
591	So the symbol is always on
592	Yeah .
593	Yeah , so that you do not replace the symbol , yeah .
594	Yeah
595	yeah
596	yeah .
597	Something like that ,
598	in the Yeah .
599	Or the th the the lowest part of the remote is not changed by the front .
600	Yeah ,
601	yeah .
602	But let is not focus on the front .
603	Yeah .
604	Those kind of things .
605	Yes .
606	Okay .
607	Well so like I said I thought we would we would use more function .
608	If we we had to include more functions .
609	But we do not .
610	So Yeah .
611	Alright .
612	I think this is about the maximum number of buttons we need .
613	Maybe some less .
614	Like eject we do not need , and some other buttons we do not need .
615	I think
616	Yeah , I will .
617	Mike , can you put that picture from me on the in the Word documents file ?
618	In Map ?
619	The younger
620	I think for the remote less is more .
621	The less buttons the better the design .
622	We should go with that concept I think .
623	Yeah .
624	Yeah , I agree .
625	I know .
626	Alright .
627	I have I have got another point .
628	Yeah ?
629	Well what if we
630	I at I at home have a remote that has the most familiar buttons on the top , and the bottom side of the front has a little clip ,
631	a f a little
632	You can click away and then you have f much more functions that most people do not use
633	but s some do do .
634	there are two target audi audiences , and we have chose for the younger one .
635	, research has shown that it is a high interested in features .
636	They are high high interested in feature .
637	But they are more critical .
638	Fo
639	Yeah , critical .
640	So
641	The younger audience .
642	So we must must design a control that really speaks to the people .
643	I think the most functions underneath that
644	No
645	usually But Yeah I think m most Most
646	Clip are not used much .
647	Well but because you say they their features are important , they want m a lot ,
648	but not
649	Yeah .
650	Yeah right .
651	Yeah ,
652	but what kind of features ?
653	Like LCD screens and voice recognition .
654	Yeah
655	but Yeah .
656	But I have
657	Yeah , that is nice .
658	Here , look at these numbers .
659	The newest features are , like I said , are LCD and speech control .
660	Our audience , these people , are very like these features .
661	You see ?
662	So we must build in something , or they will to go to the concurrent .
663	Yeah .
664	The concurrent ?
665	Competitors , right .
666	Our competitor .
667	Competitors .
668	Yeah .
669	So , I do think we have to have some features .
670	Yeah .
671	Even though they cost a little more .
672	Well maybe w we could s
673	On some calculators you have lo those little little LCD th that you can click on or something , or that you can click out of the remote .
674	Right .
675	Right .
676	And if if that is gives you a little bit of sta status information .
677	Like a ticker tape .
678	Yeah .
679	Which programme you are l watching or something .
680	Those kind of things ,
681	because you also have those those program recognition for your V VCRs .
682	And well if y if your remote picks that up also , you they can display which programme you are currently watching .
683	Yeah , right .
684	Yeah .
685	Yeah right .
686	Yeah .
687	So it it just signals the the different sig the different symbols on the screen you have , because if you change to s channel two you have two on the screen and two on your on your on your LCD screen .
688	Yeah .
689	For example .
690	It it could be such a little th that you can click in and out and you and you have it .
691	Yeah ,
692	we should keep that simple too .
693	But should it really be clickable ,
694	or or just integrate inside to try to make it d more trendy .
695	It will
696	No ,
697	it should be integrated .
698	Yeah .
699	No not clickable .
700	Well maybe .
701	Nah , no no no .
702	I think
703	Yeah ,
704	something like on some radios in car .
705	Yeah ,
706	just at at the top .
707	So when you s you sit like this you can can watch .
708	I think it should be at the top .
709	Yeah .
710	Yeah .
711	You
712	Where it is , yeah , walking to
713	Yeah .
714	Yeah right .
715	It is a ticker tape idea .
716	RDSs or something .
717	But that is of course a bit more expensive than the basic calculator design , with the scrolling text and that kind of thing .
718	Wa Yeah .
719	Well it is just one script .
720	Well I think it is you got
721	It just means it is a script that is keeps it rolling , and it is not That is five minutes off implementing time I think
722	Yeah .
723	Yeah , five minutes of ja ja for programming .
724	So I do not think that is the issue .
725	No .
726	Alright .
727	Alright , we go with the LCD screen ?
728	Kay .
729	well I think so , yes .
730	Yeah well we we we still need to know how much that will cost .
731	We are g
732	No
733	but we are we will have to look into that .
734	Right ,
735	I do not know if I can find that , but
736	Next time .
737	Or maybe you will get that information
738	Yeah .
739	we can use this board again , I think .
740	Yeah right .
741	we can put some decisions about the controls we want , th the issue .
742	Where is my presentation ?
743	Well
744	I mean we are all here now , I think .
745	Yeah , I understand what you are saying .
746	We should have a general idea of how it is going to look .
747	These I have already given you .
748	So we have to decide on the different remote control functions .
749	Right .
750	So we want to have a small LCD screen that is special .
751	At the top .
752	Should not we start with the most important parts ?
753	The LCD screen alright
754	but we should start with the power button ?
755	Huh ?
756	And then
757	Maybe we should centralise the discussion here .
758	At the top or at the bottom ?
759	Yeah
760	but
761	Yeah but with with the LCD screen on the top it gets a bit unnatural .
762	Yes .
763	I think the top is more
764	When you s How do you zap ?
765	You just sit in your chair ?
766	With the remote ?
767	Yeah but that is where your hand ball might be .
768	Yeah .
769	That thing is terrible .
770	Cause most remotes have some space left at the bottom .
771	Well
772	Well I th
773	I think Mike Mike has a point ,
774	because when when when I use a remote
775	I
776	l
777	I hate the buttons but buttons at the at the bottom .
778	Yeah , I dunno .
779	Yeah , no .
780	We will draw two , and then we will see
781	No he thinks
782	Yeah , right .
783	I dunno what you were talking about but we are busy with something .
784	He thinks it is better to put the LCD at the bottom , and I think it is better at the top .
785	Uh huh .
786	Why do you think it is better at the bottom ?
787	But you just can put the the the the the whole interface a bit down ,
788	so that there is room for the for the interface .
789	well because most remotes have some space left at the bottom , and that way you can keep the shape recognisable for everybody .
790	But your
791	Yeah .
792	I c
793	Well I d I think that is that is ugly but
794	I th
795	Yeah .
796	The the ticker The LCD is like like small .
797	It is it is wide .
798	It is not not high .
799	Uh huh .
800	But
801	Yeah right .
802	And and we can
803	Bottom .
804	Power button always
805	Yeah .
806	Yeah .
807	So and
808	and I
809	I like to use the ones on the top .
810	Yeah , y you gotta zap like this
811	or you want to
812	Yeah .
813	So when I u when I have to have an LCD s scr window
814	Yes
815	but we we we
816	we do not want that .
817	But We are making a remote with with a few functions you know .
818	Well that is a bit exaggerated .
819	Well , I agree with you .
820	It is it is also more recognisable .
821	We High tech .
822	It looks more like a calculator to people , if you have the l the the the thing on top .
823	Yeah you do not want
824	You want
825	Yeah
826	it it
827	it must be a remote .
828	We do not want them to look like a calculator .
829	We want to look it like our original but familiar
830	Yea
831	Maybe a bic better white We White ?
832	Width .
833	Yeah w well ,
834	but you do not have to throw important aspe important aspect like familiarity completely away ,
835	because I think it is
836	I think it is still important to have it at the top , because it is it is more familiar that way .
837	Yeah .
838	Width .
839	format
840	yeah format ?
841	Line width ?
842	Width ?
843	Yeah ?
844	It is a bit off .
845	Th that is not a problem .
846	When I draw here it
847	Oh .
848	Huh ?
849	Yeah , it is off .
850	Well .
851	A little a little bit .
852	It it needs to be calibrated again .
853	Well let is talk about that later
854	It is special pen .
855	Well
856	Where ?
857	Alright , we have to make a decision now , because we do not have much time .
858	Maybe you should another pen .
859	Maybe that is better .
860	You e you only have one pen for that screen .
861	Yeah .
862	Yeah .
863	No .
864	I think we have a few functions , and we can put the LCD above it , and still have lots of room at the bottom , where you can put your hand .
865	Yeah .
866	I I agree .
867	I think it should be at the button , bottom .
868	Well I am the I
869	I am the designer , so
870	Yeah .
871	At the bottom ?
872	In a few minutes
873	Oh yeah ,
874	oh yeah , I totally agree .
875	Bottom .
876	The LCD .
877	At the bot
878	So
879	We are two VS two .
880	Yeah .
881	Yeah .
882	Well but what what if we we first decide the different functions , and then look at the design .
883	He is the boss .
884	Right .
885	Great .
886	we we were busy with that .
887	Because we have to decide this .
888	yeah we should summon the the different aspects of the thing .
889	Yeah .
890	So , we have the power button .
891	And moreover I think that you two should be come to consensus about the LCD s .
892	Yes .
893	It is your it is your job .
894	Yeah of course .
895	it is .
896	No it is our job .
897	Yeah .
898	Well we have a power button .
899	W wh
900	While you have to agree , I can say it is like this
901	and you must agree .
902	Guys ?
903	Guys ?
904	We have a power button , setting buttons , LCD window , the number buttons
905	Yes .
906	For all of us I think .
907	Yeah , right .
908	Alright , let is keep it central .
909	Yeah .
910	The ten numbers ?
911	Yeah ?
912	Volume ?
913	I think we we should use something like this to The the channel up and channel down button ?
914	Yeah , in circle , you know ?
915	And and a volume control also in it .
916	Channel ,
917	yeah .
918	Volume control .
919	Well let is look at your design .
920	the mute button .
921	Uh huh .
922	I h love that one .
923	Yes .
924	Yeah .
925	Yeah
926	yeah
927	yeah .
928	Well that is that is also design .
929	Yes .
930	Right .
931	Well h ho
932	Yes .
933	Yeah .
934	But th th on this remote th these controls are for something else , a DVD player or something .
935	Yes .
936	Yes ,
937	as I already said , we could drop some of these buttons .
938	They are for some video
939	Apart .
940	So
941	Yeah ,
942	it is it is also not good to completely stay in one position constantly with one hand .
943	You should put that power button , channel and volume should have the most importance .
944	Yeah .
945	I think these should be in one big circle in the middle .
946	Yeah , but what he said about RSI was t kind of true .
947	When when you put them all in the same place , the most used buttons , you are doing the same thing all the time , and that is just what RSI is all about .
948	So it might be smarter to put them a little more away from each other .
949	So people have to move their hand .
950	And they get less complaints of RSI .
951	Y
952	Yeah .
953	That is what I always do , because all my i important buttons are the same place .
954	It is good to move from time to time .
955	Yeah .
956	Yeah but people do not like it when their buttons are all over the place .
957	Frequency of button use .
958	Yes ?
959	Well not
960	Yes .
961	They they need to be centred .
962	No but now y
963	W would we have to choose a way in middle ?
964	channels are most is most used within the hour .
965	Uh huh .
966	Volume hardly .
967	You can see .
968	So the the channel channel buttons should be far far apart , I think , up and down .
969	No I do not think .
970	Oh .
971	Up and down far apart from each other ?
972	Well not too much .
973	Far apart ?
974	I think you can have the two buttons of up and down close together , but you do not have have to have volume control and and zapping button close together .
975	You
976	thinking about RSI ?
977	Y look at look at the frequency .
978	Yeah
979	but Yeah
980	but
981	No .
982	Nei not too much , but Nei nei
983	nei
984	n I I totally agree .
985	The other the other two frustrations are far more important .
986	So Well they are used four times an hour , so Power bu button should be left at the top .
987	Well for example the power button ,
988	you can
989	If someone is constantly z zapping , it is not going to miss , that it that the power button is not right beside it .
990	Because I have someone
991	But the buttons is way .
992	So that one can be put away .
993	But just
994	Yeah .
995	Right .
996	Yeah .
997	I agree .
998	The power button can be
999	Yes .
1000	And should and should be red .
1001	Yeah .
1002	Oh man ,
1003	five minutes .
1004	Yeah ,
1005	well five minutes left .
1006	Right , just make some decisions .
1007	Yep .
1008	The most important things we have to
1009	I do think you have to keep you have to keep it central now .
1010	how are we going to do it with those numbers ?
1011	Well I have it here .
1012	C c can you make you make
1013	We can use the drawing board now , I think .
1014	it it does not work well
1015	but But it it would be pretty pretty nice if we could just draw a simple thing .
1016	Yeah well that is going to take too too much time .
1017	Just you decide that , you decide that ,
1018	and ready .
1019	Yes .
1020	Yeah .
1021	Yes .
1022	Alright .
1023	Well the LCD .
1024	you are Industrial , you are User Interface .
1025	So I think it is going to go to Mike .
1026	Yeah .
1027	But you will have to make consensus with .
1028	Well
1029	Well it is a bit hard ,
1030	because we are going to be individually .
1031	Well consensus , We we can put it in the middle , so
1032	Alright .
1033	Nei .
1034	We are No
1035	We are deciding now , so
1036	Top or bottom ?
1037	Okay .
1038	That is a bit
1039	Yes .
1040	Well yeah I
1041	I still think it is it is quite important though to to have it at the top , so
1042	Yeah .
1043	Yes it is .
1044	You say familiarity is not important but
1045	Yeah d
1046	Yeah .
1047	Well what if we are going to now decide about the functions , and the design comes into the next round ?
1048	Plus the d th the design round is still to come huh ?
1049	Alright these functions .
1050	Yeah , right .
1051	Okay .
1052	As we we we we agreed , we do have a LCD .
1053	The number f
1054	Well yes , that is alright .
1055	So that is that is enough .
1056	Yeah , okay .
1057	W the number function .
1058	Yeah .
1059	Are we going to do it like on Mike is screen with one button that says I am going to do a t two number digital ?
1060	How do you want it to do then ?
1061	It it has to r recognise one as there could still come more .
1062	No .
1063	There is one two three four five six six seven eight nine zero .
1064	Well just when you push a one one and
1065	No ,
1066	if you
1067	On most TVs if you press two numbers shortly after each other , d it
1068	Yeah .
1069	Oh , like that .
1070	They would recognise it .
1071	Yes .
1072	Th that is the most
1073	That that is very easy .
1074	Alright so no button for that .
1075	Yeah .
1076	Yeah .
1077	No .
1078	Yeah .
1079	Okay anyone any oth other functionalities of our remote ?
1080	So
1081	No ,
1082	we would just said we did not
1083	Well
1084	well because we ca not integrate it with any other remotes , all those buttons on those pictures are irrelevant .
1085	I think these are the the most important functions .
1086	Do you still have the pictures over there ?
1087	Yeah , that is about it .
1088	Yeah .
1089	You do need the multi Or did
1090	No , like this one .
1091	You do need them ?
1092	Yeah , I know .
1093	But are we
1094	Alright , alright
1095	Now okay .
1096	Right .
1097	So just for a television is
1098	that all we need ?
1099	Teletext is gone .
1100	Yeah , it is most useable this way .
1101	Yeah .
1102	basic function .
1103	So all those buttons that ar are to do with teletext
1104	Oh screen placing .
1105	We will have those buttons about
1106	And the two important ones we are l f forgetting .
1107	there is screen .
1108	You can make it wider and less wide .
1109	Yeah .
1110	And the button that you can go to AV for your video .
1111	Right .
1112	I do think we have to put that underneath a clip .
1113	Oh yeah .
1114	Those two ?
1115	But it is just two , and we make a clip ?
1116	Th that is a bit waste .
1117	just two just two under under I
1118	I think
1119	But you you can put two or three buttons under another section .
1120	We we can make make a little row of like four buttons down here .
1121	Yes .
1122	Yeah .
1123	Okay , right .
1124	Or at the top .
1125	Your LCD screen is going to go .
1126	Or at
1127	Yeah alright then .
1128	that is that is too complicated .
1129	Yes .
1130	You can just put it somewhere
1131	They they are not used much , not as much as those other , so you can put it somewhere
1132	Yeah s bit smaller and s
1133	Well and and I think more at the bottom .
1134	Yeah
1135	Well I think they should in an in an isolated part of the remote .
1136	Oh , they can be small or round like buttons .
1137	Yeah .
1138	Yeah or at the top
1139	, yeah .
1140	What do you think those those buttons ?
1141	Above or down ?
1142	And w where ?
1143	Well we design it later .
1144	We have it , and we design later where everything goes .
1145	Yes ?
1146	Yes .
1147	Yeah .
1148	Yes .
1149	Well any other
1150	Go to video , that is always on your remote control .
1151	Well if you you take those th
1152	If you
1153	Yeah , but you can z you can zap t
1154	you can you can zap to the video channel from zero to
1155	Yeah ,
1156	but when you zap down zero you get to AV .
1157	Why go to video ?
1158	That is just zero .
1159	To AV to AV
1160	AV AV .
1161	The the video channel ?
1162	No no not always .
1163	Yeah .
1164	Well l n no not at not at my remote .
1165	Ze yeah zero is a different channel than the the video channel .
1166	Yeah .
1167	Yeah , but you can can zap down
1168	Yes , I think th
1169	No , then you press ninety nine .
1170	Yes .
1171	I do not .
1172	I go to ninety nine .
1173	well whatever , .
1174	I think go to video is an irrelevant button , but
1175	Yeah well y you must have .
1176	Th that is the button
1177	No .
1178	But it is easy to go
1179	If you are at at channel fifty five and you want to go immediately to the video channel , you do you have to push a to to get below zero .
1180	No you can ch push zero .
1181	It is more easy to get to where the specific video channel button .
1182	Yeah .
1183	Yeah ,
1184	I I think that one button is I use it
1185	Yeah ?
1186	These buttons , I do not have buttons for channel setting especially on my remote .
1187	Yeah , but if we are choosing to incorporate these buttons , you have to have channel setting , if you wa if you have a new TV .
1188	You have to set the channels .
1189	Right all th these different buttons you have to , I do .
1190	Yeah well d different screen settings a Yeah , sk
1191	Yeah y you
1192	you
1193	you
1194	you have screen width .
1195	It is it is incorporated with p m plus and down , those
1196	So we still have one four ?
1197	Ch ch
1198	Okay .
1199	Yeah you
1200	yeah
1201	you have one one button from s set frequency o or something , and then with plus and min
1202	minus you can adjust the
1203	Yeah , alright .
1204	Right .
1205	That is the only one we put in there .
1206	For a screen fu channel setting .
1207	Yeah to oh yeah of course
1208	to configure the programme
1209	the Yeah .
1210	Programme , right .
1211	Oh the Okay button ?
1212	Oh you always have in the centre an Okay button , for your menu .
1213	Yeah .
1214	Menu button .
1215	You should
1216	Yeah .
1217	I think that is important .
1218	And and the settings to change the brightness the settings to change the brightness and the contrast .
1219	Channel , setting , menu .
1220	We have to go .
1221	Okay .
1222	Channel ,
1223	yeah .
1224	So Save .
1225	Chief ?
1226	Chief ?
1227	Th the menu menu button is also important .
1228	Yes see .
1229	Then you can
1230	Where ?
1231	I do not see it .
1232	Yes
1233	I have put it in .
1234	Here .
1235	Oh Menu , alright .
1236	I think things like contrast and brightness should be in the menu ,
1237	yeah .
1238	In the menu .
1239	And you can then adjust it with the zapping buttons or something .
1240	Yeah , the
1241	Or the volume or something like that .
1242	Because the zapping buttons are not used then if you are in the menu .
1243	Alright .
1244	Guys ?
1245	We are going to go to our rooms , and we will have to decide s things on our own I think .
1246	Yeah .
1247	Or the volume , yeah .
1248	Your pen .
1249	Great .
1250	So
1251	Well see you
1252	W w we have lunchtime , by the way , now so
1253	Lunch .
1254	Yes chief .
1255	Alright .
1256	I thought we would lunch right now , or not ?
1257	Yeah this is this is your thing .
1258	Okay .
1259	I am hungry .
1260	 
1261	Okay .
1262	door is closed .
1263	Well , let is begin .
1264	Because if we have as much time as the last meeting , we will have to hurry up .
1265	I am listening .
1266	Right .
1267	well I will start with the presentation again , the agenda .
1268	Great .
1269	Yo .
1270	So .
1271	This one I think .
1272	yeah .
1273	Well alright .
1274	well , I will show you the notes .
1275	It is not as interesting as it should be
1276	because we just had the meeting ,
1277	but I will show them .
1278	We will get your presentations again on the conceptual design .
1279	Then we will have to dec decide about the control , the remote control concepts .
1280	I have put a f a file in the project management folder , which says exactly what kind of decisions we should take .
1281	So this time we exactly know what to decide about .
1282	Alright , great .
1283	And then we will close again .
1284	Alright .
1285	Well these are some examples ,
1286	but we will talk about them later .
1287	We will first look at your presentations .
1288	Alright ?
1289	Walter will start again this time ?
1290	Yo .
1291	Yeah , great .
1292	Alright , Trendwatch .
1293	Kay .
1294	Right .
1295	I will speak about latest trends trends , latest fashion updates , and things we must not do .
1296	Kay .
1297	the trends .
1298	It is very important that the control is fancy looking and good feeling .
1299	this because of our last model was very functional , but it people did not like that , so our new mo model must be very good looking .
1300	That is something you have to take a look at .
1301	Alright .
1302	And the feeling has to be very great .
1303	Also the menus and things like that they have to they have to feel great .
1304	Alright .
1305	there is a minus two times here , because this is the most important point .
1306	This is two times as less important , and same for this one .
1307	Less .
1308	, technological technological innovations , that is regarded very highly too .
1309	such as an LCD screen , speech acknowledgement , as we talked about earlier .
1310	Well , yeah .
1311	So we have to have something like that ,
1312	like we
1313	Right .
1314	LCD and our our fronts .
1315	the last point is easy to use .
1316	Well I think that speaks for s for itself .
1317	I do not know who is who is going to look at that .
1318	Easy to use ?
1319	I think that is your ta
1320	Well , easy to use s is a bit contradictionary with the first Functional is not an issue , and then easy to use .
1321	Yeah ?
1322	Yeah , I know .
1323	Well we have to choose one of them .
1324	I think we have to go for the first one .
1325	Yeah .
1326	It is the most important one .
1327	So we have to take that one .
1328	Okay .
1329	So it it it is not very important that that it works easy .
1330	Well something fancy looking can be can be easy to use .
1331	But it has to look great .
1332	Yeah .
1333	We will we will look at .
1334	We will see .
1335	You
1336	Yeah .
1337	Yeah , yeah ,
1338	you can make a very complicated remote anyway , so ease of use
1339	It is not a very comp complicated device .
1340	Yeah , right .
1341	But the most important thing is that it looks great and people say wow , that is real great great concept .
1342	Alright .
1343	Kay .
1344	Alright .
1345	these are the new colours of this year .
1346	So it must be very bright , very colourful .
1347	People like this .
1348	So we we have to think in this direction .
1349	So i set your mind to it .
1350	So
1351	Well
1352	Yeah ,
1353	well Yeah .
1354	Findings ?
1355	Fashion update ?
1356	Fruit and vegetables are cool .
1357	I am told .
1358	you think ?
1359	The group we are targeting is very pleased with fruit and vegetables .
1360	So we we we might cons consider in front of in in that sort of way .
1361	Bananas .
1362	furthermore material , that is your part , should be very strong .
1363	I was thinking of something like well iron plate over it , maybe in a colour or something ,
1364	that looks so f really flashy but
1365	it it is also strong .
1366	And that is also for the younger public .
1367	B
1368	Well the the handy thing about our fronts is that we can follow these trends e ev every year .
1369	Th this year it is fruits but next year it is it is something totally different .
1370	Yeah , that is great .
1371	Yeah .
1372	But I think we can all make the the fronts of titanium or something really thin .
1373	Yes .
1374	So it looks very heavy but you can still use it very easily .
1375	Yep , alright .
1376	Well , the do nots .
1377	Older people like dark colours and simple shapes .
1378	Well we do not want older people , we want young people .
1379	So we are going to turn that around .
1380	We are going to have real cool shapes and lots of colours .
1381	Alright .
1382	Right ?
1383	Okay .
1384	Wood is popular .
1385	Aha .
1386	We do not want wood .
1387	Yeah , among the old people , yeah .
1388	Yeah
1389	yeah
1390	yeah .
1391	Old people .
1392	So , that is it for me .
1393	Alright .
1394	Nice , well show us .
1395	Right , I am going to tell you something about the components design .
1396	again I have put up the specification properties .
1397	This so the different components of the of of the device .
1398	And the materials ?
1399	I have heard several things ,
1400	so I I will have to change that on the way .
1401	But the case ?
1402	I suggested in the previous meeting hard plastic .
1403	But as you indicated it should be strong .
1404	Yeah , we should change that .
1405	It should feel strong .
1406	So maybe plastic is not sufficient .
1407	We should move to something
1408	Well yeah .
1409	Well maybe it it it is , but it does not look strong .
1410	So maybe
1411	But we still have to look at our price of course .
1412	Y Hard plastic i is of course pretty pretty tough , but it does not have a really really tough look .
1413	No no no .
1414	So
1415	Yeah .
1416	Because if we want an LCD window etcetera
1417	Yeah ?
1418	Yes .
1419	Also
1420	Yeah .
1421	But we will return to that .
1422	the buttons of course rubber , I think everyone agrees .
1423	And electrical cables , copper is all pretty basic stuff .
1424	The chips made of silicon , I guess .
1425	I think that is the best way to do it .
1426	And infra infrared l LED is just a simple bulb .
1427	Then I have had a few findings , made a few findings .
1428	the target audience product style .
1429	it is generally the case that senior and wealthy people above forty five years old like , as you said , particularly the traditional materials as such as wood and materials such as that .
1430	They also like straightforward shapes and luxurious style .
1431	But of course that is not our things this .
1432	So this is things we must not do .
1433	And then we have young and dynamic people , which is of course our group , the people we aim at .
1434	under forty five years old .
1435	they like soft materials with primary colours .
1436	Soft materials is of course agai again a bit a contradiction with our material choice of what you said , that it should be hard an and and and and strong looking .
1437	Yeah .
1438	But they like soft materials ,
1439	so we might we have to consider that .
1440	Yeah .
1441	And also they like curved round shapes .
1442	So not too formal like like the older people want .
1443	And if also a finding but not very ap applicable here , that sports and gaming devices such as discmans for jogging and that those kind of devices , gaming devices , should define the characteristics of the device .
1444	But since we do not have a really a sports or gaming device , so we do not really have to consider that .
1445	Sports , they are that are accessible on on your LCD window
1446	Huh ?
1447	That is nice .
1448	Soccer fronts .
1449	Well I also have several examples of styles , so you can get a clear picture of what I mean .
1450	All the results ?
1451	Yeah .
1452	We keep coming back to the fronts .
1453	Yeah .
1454	these are the basic older older peoples' stuff .
1455	Yeah .
1456	Yeah .
1457	It was not very interesting ,
1458	very classical looking , but that is n that is not what we want .
1459	We have these kind of things .
1460	I do not know what exactly they are .
1461	It looks like
1462	Well you know you recognise the shapes , it is very primary colours , bright colours and round shapes .
1463	Nai .
1464	no .
1465	You also see this device , it is not very round and
1466	Fruity of course .
1467	Fruity .
1468	Fruity .
1469	Yeah , it
1470	That is true .
1471	It is t terrible .
1472	Alright .
1473	And well round shapes , primary colours .
1474	You can see it all here .
1475	And of course this famous device .
1476	Yeah , alright .
1477	I think as you know something some devices like this .
1478	So to give you an idea of
1479	This has a strong look .
1480	Well it is got a strong look , this .
1481	Although it is plastic , it is it is grey to to to give it iron look .
1482	Yeah .
1483	Yeah , it still has a strong look .
1484	Yeah .
1485	And it is round .
1486	That is
1487	Yeah .
1488	But then you are losing your fruity colours .
1489	Well we have to make a
1490	Well we ca not really make a round a round remote control .
1491	Well you can make th th th that middle ring
1492	can you you can make another colour .
1493	That is true .
1494	So those kind of things you can you can combine .
1495	I do not think that is very practical ,
1496	but But it is important to to to think about the colour .
1497	No , it is not .
1498	Okay .
1499	Because if we make it grey or or silvery looking , it it does make it a lot more does make it looking a lot more stronger .
1500	Yeah but the
1501	But it does not have to look strong .
1502	Yes .
1503	Cause if you look at this , it it does not look very very strong , becau
1504	But this is plastic , and and this too , but
1505	The feel ?
1506	alright .
1507	The the results are , the feel of the material is expected to be strongy .
1508	The feel .
1509	Well
1510	So , if you ti
1511	Well You you
1512	Maybe you should have some some coloured titanium or something .
1513	And it it does not have to be strong , also .
1514	Nah
1515	yeah
1516	the feel
1517	Right .
1518	Only the feel .
1519	So it it looks pretty but it feels strong .
1520	Oh .
1521	I agree .
1522	And I Then I have some more findings .
1523	about the energy energy source of the of the device ,
1524	I suggest the basic battery .
1525	I got some other energy sources of course .
1526	But solar energy is not very practical inside a house , because you do not have a have a lot of sun .
1527	And kinetic and and and dynamos are are not very practical , I think , for for a simple remote , that is a bit ,
1528	oh , that is a bit That is a bit much .
1529	No titanium .
1530	And I also suggest as a shape a double curved case .
1531	the disadvantage of that that you can use no titanium .
1532	That that is the information I received .
1533	If you use the curved case , a curved case , double curved then you ca not use titanium .
1534	What do you exactly mean with double curved ?
1535	Double curved ?
1536	It it mean
1537	Yeah , well okay .
1538	Now this to give it a more modern look .
1539	And now the the shape , yeah , a curved case .
1540	yeah
1541	I think sort of triangle shaped bottom or something .
1542	a more modern look not plain , long box style , but
1543	I will draw it , but maybe later .
1544	I dunno .
1545	Yeah .
1546	Yeah .
1547	And it makes it gives it a more u user friendly shape , than if you have .
1548	anyway
1549	f as for the buttons , simple push buttons .
1550	No otherwi no difficult scroll things or some things like that ,
1551	because it makes more complex and expensive .
1552	And , as we agreed , we do not use a speaker or a sensor or speak speech controlled device .
1553	Yeah right .
1554	Because it makes it also more complex and expensive .
1555	But we do use an LCD screen , so we we do have to consider of we have to use a more advanced chip , which is more complex and expensive .
1556	But It is worth the trouble I think ,
1557	because
1558	rubber is a soft material , I guess .
1559	Well
1560	This soft material thing from Yeah .
1561	The buttons can be made of an a soft material .
1562	Because people like that .
1563	Yeah .
1564	soft enough .
1565	Yeah .
1566	Right .
1567	Right .
1568	Yeah .
1569	So that is basically what I want to talk about .
1570	Alright .
1571	Okay .
1572	We will take that .
1573	And then Mike ?
1574	Okay .
1575	Yeah .
1576	Well nah the method we will include the buttons as we discussed earlier .
1577	an LCD s screen will be implemented .
1578	we must decide where , this meeting .
1579	there are new developments in speech recognition systems , and they are already being used on coffee machines .
1580	And well they are cheap ,
1581	so we could use them now .
1582	Oh
1583	That is interesting .
1584	it is not really speech recognition , it is more like you can talk to the chip , record the message and record an answer ,
1585	and then once you talk to the remote , then he will a answer with the the prerecorded message that you left .
1586	So if I say hi Mike , and you have recorded hi
1587	Mike back , then you will get that .
1588	Oh , yeah , I understand .
1589	Oh okay .
1590	Yeah .
1591	Okay .
1592	Right .
1593	But you can also say that , when you say something , it does some function .
1594	No it does not does not do anything .
1595	No .
1596	Oh .
1597	But i it is just a
1598	Yeah it is it is cheap .
1599	That is a bit
1600	Yes .
1601	But that that makes it cheap .
1602	It is it is just a an extra function , and it is cheap .
1603	Yeah .
1604	I understand .
1605	But it has no functionality for our remote at all .
1606	No
1607	but
1608	Yeah , right .
1609	No
1610	but that is the gadget they want , or the gimmicks .
1611	But it it is n nice for young people .
1612	Young people love them .
1613	Yes , we we should really include that one , I think .
1614	They like gadgets .
1615	Yeah , ple
1616	Right .
1617	Yeah .
1618	If it is cheap .
1619	Well , as I said earlier I think the LCD screen should be positioned at the lower end of the remote .
1620	Yeah .
1621	the buttons for screen width and general settings and and that kind of stuff we can also do let that kind of functions be shown in the LCD screen , instead of extra buttons .
1622	So you put a menu in the LCD ?
1623	I think young people and yeah
1624	w well every user would like that .
1625	the buttons should be positioned positioned the same way as they are on a , well , conventional remote , I think .
1626	For the learnability and well to keep it recognisable .
1627	A voice recognition can be implemented .
1628	And I drew an example ,
1629	but it did not work quite the well the way I wanted it to do .
1630	Alright .
1631	Can you draw it now of
1632	Can you draw it now ?
1633	How How
1634	How do you give input to the menu on the LCD screen ?
1635	Alright .
1636	Well I have the
1637	I can draw it again ,
1638	and I know what I did wrong .
1639	I did not tick the note bo box in the .
1640	Alright .
1641	with the the up and down and and well buttons and the
1642	Well I will draw what I had drawn on the screen .
1643	So you have a menu button , and then you can go up and down .
1644	But then we should also have an an Okay button .
1645	Yeah right .
1646	Yes .
1647	I shall draw this .
1648	button , yeah .
1649	If it works .
1650	Just
1651	There is already a blank .
1652	Yes ?
1653	So Yeah .
1654	Yeah .
1655	so have I .
1656	Nah .
1657	You have to push hard .
1658	I suggest a banana shape .
1659	Because of the fruity fashion .
1660	Yeah .
1661	Yeah .
1662	No
1663	m
1664	Next year that is out .
1665	Yellow and
1666	Yeah alright , yeah .
1667	Just a hunch .
1668	Well these little buttons are a bit difficult to draw correct .
1669	Yeah .
1670	Those are the the cha the channel buttons of course ?
1671	And then below is the LCD screen ?
1672	Alright , yeah .
1673	Yeah just the numbers .
1674	These these will be bigger in the the real design .
1675	This must be the Okay button used to interact with the LCD screen .
1676	And with this you can , yes , go to through the menus
1677	and that can
1678	the video button should be an apart button , because you want it to t ,
1679	yeah ,
1680	to use it fast within one click .
1681	Yeah .
1682	You have
1683	Right .
1684	Yes .
1685	And what is the menu button ?
1686	But how did How do you get out of the menu then ?
1687	Yeah .
1688	And you you need a you need a speaker .
1689	it is
1690	This button can also be the Menu button , we use in the menus
1691	Well we we can add another button here , but
1692	Yeah .
1693	For the
1694	Yeah .
1695	Maybe I you could j just do an an exit with Okay .
1696	by pe pressing the menu button again .
1697	By pressing the menu button again , you go out .
1698	Yes , well but
1699	bec because when you push Menu you get in , and then you have to push
1700	Okay when you get to a choice .
1701	Yeah .
1702	It is usual the the the d kind of the way it works .
1703	Yeah ?
1704	Yeah ?
1705	Yeah .
1706	right .
1707	Well you you
1708	No no ,
1709	we we we should add a extra Menu button
1710	and this the Okay button .
1711	Well that is also the Okay button .
1712	But you can men you can press menu again to get out .
1713	That is you you should have
1714	Or you can put in the LCD is window an option Get Out .
1715	No .
1716	Exit .
1717	Exit .
1718	once you have an extra Menu button , you do not need that that extra option .
1719	Well , it is just a choice .
1720	You have redundancy .
1721	But we need a we need a a recording recording button for the speech part .
1722	Or do not
1723	Right ,
1724	and spea speaker at the back , or something .
1725	Yeah ,
1726	if we decide to to implement that , maybe we should .
1727	Why would you put it then , and where is the recording the microphone ?
1728	Where would you put it ?
1729	Uh huh .
1730	Well they that could be anywhere .
1731	That is very small .
1732	It could be down here .
1733	Well , not here .
1734	I
1735	yeah
1736	I suggest here .
1737	But that is just a little gap .
1738	Microphone , yeah .
1739	Yeah .
1740	Well the speaker and the microphone , I think , are the same little hole thingy .
1741	Yeah I understand .
1742	Yeah .
1743	but we could d do , but it is perhaps more expensive , the speaker on the back or something .
1744	Alright .
1745	Well i
1746	there are a all already being implemented in in coffee machines , so they wo not be very expensive .
1747	But This is my suggested design .
1748	Huh ?
1749	Yeah ?
1750	Okay .
1751	Alright .
1752	Alright .
1753	Well , okay , alright .
1754	Yes .
1755	then let is have a look at the decisions we are going to have to make .
1756	And oh I think as you can see so , the LCD screen does look better at the lower end , or at the bottom .
1757	I would I agree .
1758	Yeah , fine .
1759	But
1760	Oh , I had some examples .
1761	Fine .
1762	Move on .
1763	Well yeah
1764	yeah
1765	yeah .
1766	Yeah .
1767	I can live with it .
1768	You can
1769	But I did not like it very much , but Well these are quite obvious , very ugly remote .
1770	Yes ?
1771	Too big .
1772	Yeah .
1773	They do they do not look fruity enough .
1774	No , well th
1775	Yeah .
1776	Nei They are n they are not trendy .
1777	They are all black .
1778	Well not all .
1779	Hey , that one I like .
1780	this is for children but th
1781	No .
1782	Tho
1783	Yeah those
1784	But it does not the
1785	Yeah , ok Yeah .
1786	It does not look strong .
1787	No .
1788	W but with the colours
1789	i it is a bit the way we are going to .
1790	The remote .
1791	Yeah right .
1792	Well this is a terrible
1793	this looks
1794	Yeah .
1795	Terrible .
1796	This is just crazy .
1797	It is it is all too much buttons .
1798	But it it must not look too childish of course huh ?
1799	But it
1800	Yeah .
1801	Too many buttons .
1802	That is
1803	Well , that is too expensive I think .
1804	This these are the LCD screens .
1805	I think we should , if it is possible , one with colours , but
1806	I do not know
1807	Too expensive ?
1808	Alright .
1809	Nah th
1810	It is too expensive .
1811	Yeah .
1812	Well Nah .
1813	Alright .
1814	Yeah .
1815	Okay .
1816	Ha , even more .
1817	Huh .
1818	N
1819	Well
1820	Yeah , this is what we have just done .
1821	no .
1822	But are we going for a strange form ?
1823	Cause people like that .
1824	Kay .
1825	No , not very strange .
1826	Not not too strange .
1827	Not too strange .
1828	No .
1829	You can make the the underside , you can make it more round , where the LCD is .
1830	It still has t
1831	Yes .
1832	Th
1833	a a kind of bridge .
1834	So it f falls over the hand .
1835	I dunno if you know the No Nokia telephone , with the round thing at at the bottoms , s something like that .
1836	Yeah ?
1837	Yeah ?
1838	Yeah .
1839	You know ?
1840	Yeah ,
1841	but people like something new you know .
1842	Well I have at home a remote with a bridge .
1843	It is just a half round half half circle at
1844	And then it falls exactly over the hand ,
1845	and that is very nice .
1846	That is It feels comfortable .
1847	Exotic yeah .
1848	Yeah , different .
1849	We have t
1850	Yeah ,
1851	yeah .
1852	Yeah .
1853	I will design it , we design it later .
1854	Y yis
1855	Alright .
1856	So we will get to that later I guess .
1857	Great .
1858	Yeah , alright .
1859	where did I put it ?
1860	conceptual phase , I think this is it .
1861	The specific shape .
1862	The
1863	Our sources .
1864	I got this from our friends .
1865	So yeah the conceptual design .
1866	These are a few examples which we have to decide about .
1867	All the the materials from the case , the electric cable that is all your your side of the story .
1868	Yeah .
1869	Your bag .
1870	now from the user interface , your package ?
1871	where
1872	No well , that is more like the buttons where they have to come .
1873	And B a bit of , yeah well , a bit of design .
1874	But we should decide now .
1875	Yes ,
1876	but we have to decide about these now .
1877	Right ?
1878	right .
1879	Yeah .
1880	Materials are the most , most impor
1881	Yeah .
1882	And the trend watching .
1883	So as you said , fruity is in , well sells good .
1884	Wow .
1885	these things .
1886	So we have to put it in one document .
1887	yes .
1888	so if we go through them
1889	Yeah well
1890	Why should I
1891	Yeah .
1892	Copy paste this story into a into a Word document , and then put the answers after the subjects .
1893	Yeah .
1894	Not everything .
1895	Well we have to decide all these things ?
1896	W we can override them ?
1897	Well a case ?
1898	that is me .
1899	Yeah but all these examples are of a coffee machine .
1900	So
1901	What what kind of properties should it have ?
1902	Well we just listened .
1903	I suggest
1904	Well what do I suggest actually ?
1905	s solid ,
1906	yeah .
1907	I think we
1908	Why do not we use titanium or or a hard , yeah , some kind of metal for the the the whole remote except the front .
1909	Yeah .
1910	Do you know the new
1911	No no
1912	The front is the most important .
1913	That
1914	Just like most cell phones are .
1915	Yeah , I understand .
1916	Yeah .
1917	So we have titanium .
1918	Yeah but the non removable elements of the of the remote , so not the front , could be titanium ,
1919	to give that strong look .
1920	Yeah .
1921	You know what ?
1922	Alright .
1923	And then the front is made of plastic .
1924	And you can put that on and off , and switch it .
1925	Yeah .
1926	But the feel of plastic is not strong .
1927	No but you have titanium of course .
1928	No but you you have this
1929	Yeah .
1930	you have the best of both worlds .
1931	Yeah alright , alright .
1932	Kay .
1933	Yeah , you have the re remote in your hand like this .
1934	So you feel titanium .
1935	And of course , yeah , you have the the the plastic front end .
1936	But you also have the titanium .
1937	Yeah .
1938	Fronts are are cheaper than when they are from plas
1939	Yeah ,
1940	but it it is expensive .
1941	Yeah .
1942	Yeah of course ,
1943	but yeah you have to make a decision .
1944	And I do not know if you can make steel just any way you want it to .
1945	I guess so .
1946	titanium
1947	I sh
1948	I think
1949	Huh ?
1950	Well , well the
1951	According to my sources , it is it is totally possible to make an entire Titanium is available , and we can make an entire remote out of it , if we want .
1952	Yeah .
1953	Bendable .
1954	Bendable .
1955	Well any colour
1956	Yeah ,
1957	then you you paint it in the colour you want it .
1958	Yeah .
1959	The plastic is is the colour you want it .
1960	Paint spray .
1961	Yeah alright .
1962	So Yeah .
1963	So ,
1964	we are going for a titanium back and a plastic front ?
1965	Yeah , great .
1966	I have
1967	Titanium back , plastic front .
1968	Yeah , I think that is a nice trade off .
1969	Okay .
1970	well I am going to put it in here , because we can look .
1971	Yeah .
1972	I solid feel and trendy look .
1973	Alright .
1974	So material , hard plastic
1975	for the front ?
1976	Okay .
1977	Yeah , for the front and then titanium for the back .
1978	Yeah .
1979	For the non removable part .
1980	But then you have the problem , when you have a titanium back , you ca not switch it .
1981	When you want an other colour on the front , it does not match .
1982	Well but The titan titanium is not is not v very
1983	Yeah , i it does not curves .
1984	You know ?
1985	I understand .
1986	Well titanium is neutral .
1987	No I nei .
1988	Titanium is very
1989	No no no ,
1990	but you know b Titanium is very basic colour , and it does not really matter if we have a purple front on it or a orange front .
1991	Yeah ,
1992	yeah ,
1993	yeah .
1994	Yeah .
1995	Yeah .
1996	Alright .
1997	I dunno if if you disagree ,
1998	but I think it is does not matter very much .
1999	Well
2000	Our customers will use those funky trendy colours , and they do not use wood .
2001	Yeah .
2002	Alright .
2003	And even if it does does not match , it will People like colours that do not match .
2004	Funky customers .
2005	Yeah .
2006	Alright .
2007	And well
2008	the the electrical cable is just normal .
2009	Cop copper material .
2010	Yeah .
2011	Excuse me ?
2012	Yeah copper i just a ba basic
2013	Yeah in
2014	Yeah well inside the remote control we use a couple of
2015	Oh external ?
2016	Well A coffee grind does not have
2017	Na ja .
2018	The electrical cable does
2019	No we do not use an electrical cable .
2020	It is from our coffee
2021	Of course .
2022	Yeah inside , but this is for the coffee machine .
2023	Yeah ,
2024	but that is not what is meant here , I think .
2025	Nei .
2026	So external .
2027	Yeah .
2028	Yeah .
2029	Never mind the coffee grind .
2030	Well
2031	all the all the inside work of our remote is standard work .
2032	So
2033	The chip is normal silicon .
2034	Right ?
2035	Alright .
2036	the buttons are normal , etcetera .
2037	Okay ?
2038	So that is just easy .
2039	we decide about that just by looking at our competitors and our earlier remotes .
2040	The conceptual specification of the user interface ?
2041	well we have our beautiful drawing .
2042	Well I got a better one here
2043	and I will
2044	The shared folder .
2045	Alright .
2046	Well you can put that in into the shared folder ,
2047	and then I will put it in our end report .
2048	I will work this out for the next meeting .
2049	Yes ,
2050	you can
2051	yeah .
2052	You can put some which button is what .
2053	Yeah
2054	yeah
2055	yeah .
2056	Okay .
2057	the trend watching
2058	included these days .
2059	And what do we ?
2060	We thing that fruit and bright colours are
2061	Yes .
2062	Yeah the the the front w
2063	I think we can launch a couple of packages .
2064	You can buy a different kind of of of machine , but it is the same thing , but with another front .
2065	Yeah .
2066	So
2067	And you can you can
2068	Yeah right .
2069	We can also implement we can also implement fronts from movies that are very hot .
2070	Yeah
2071	that is the whole idea of the front .
2072	Yeah .
2073	Yeah .
2074	those kind of things .
2075	Yes .
2076	But that is for later on .
2077	The fronts y you can do anything with them .
2078	Yeah .
2079	Yeah
2080	but if you if you launch five different packages like iPod mini
2081	Yeah .
2082	Yeah , right
2083	For the initiative launch .
2084	For the for the launch , yeah .
2085	It is good marketing .
2086	Launch different lines at once .
2087	So e th then a c couple of basic colours .
2088	Not not very sim Not
2089	Yeah .
2090	Yeah ,
2091	n not too heavy .
2092	You can always take another pick .
2093	We should not give them the m the most lovely front when they buy it for the first time .
2094	They have to buy it later on .
2095	Oh yeah .
2096	Yeah .
2097	Yeah right .
2098	Yeah .
2099	Yeah .
2100	Come on .
2101	More basic .
2102	We still have to make those fifty million ,
2103	yeah ? .
2104	Yeah .
2105	Yeah .
2106	Very boring , yeah .
2107	Well you can you can give them s s three or so , so that they can experiment with it and that they want more .
2108	The most boring fronts possible .
2109	The most ugly .
2110	Yeah , right .
2111	Two .
2112	Yeah but you you can have some basic colours , and then we come with the special patterns on them ,
2113	and and
2114	And
2115	we still have to make We have still have to make the es the the real basic design .
2116	Red red , blue and green
2117	you give them or something , and then you can give them other ones .
2118	Yeah .
2119	Yeah .
2120	Yeah .
2121	Alright .
2122	well the buttons etcetera , we get from Mike .
2123	this fruit and bright colours ,
2124	yeah
2125	well I think we will have to in the next half an hour
2126	, we will have to s s specify the different types we want to launch , when we well introduce our remote .
2127	Because yeah we have the sketch but
2128	Alright , yeah .
2129	Yeah .
2130	But we we must remember that fancy look and feel is the most important thing .
2131	Yes .
2132	Else it w wo not sell .
2133	So
2134	Lost my mouse .
2135	Yes .
2136	Well I will have to ,
2137	before I get another warning for five minutes , I am going to get
2138	Where is my mouse ?
2139	where is my mouse ?
2140	Oh yeah .
2141	this is it .
2142	Unbelievable .
2143	Well , this we have .
2144	Yeah .
2145	basic stuff .
2146	Interface we have .
2147	Supplements , LCD .
2148	Maybe a a cheap voice recording .
2149	Well Yes .
2150	Yeah we should do that .
2151	The price ?
2152	We all agree on that .
2153	Alright .
2154	Individual actions .
2155	Yeah .
2156	Industry designer , .
2157	User Interface , Mike .
2158	You are going to work together on a prototype drawing on the SMARTboard .
2159	Yeah ,
2160	we can do that .
2161	Together or
2162	Yeah together .
2163	Yeah togeth
2164	You can take the SMARTboard .
2165	How Yeah yeah , but how do I
2166	Some Some non functional tasks .
2167	That is what I got to hear .
2168	But bu we stay we stay here or something ?
2169	right .
2170	Yes
2171	well we will get it to hear that I think .
2172	But I think so .
2173	Th they are saying SMARTboard and that is it
2174	This is the SMARTboard , so
2175	so you can you
2176	you are going to make a prototype , and y
2177	Well that is includes specifying the buttons etcetera .
2178	And take it to our rooms
2179	and
2180	specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach .
2181	Yeah .
2182	So you will get it on your em on your laptop .
2183	well you will go and do something else on the project
2184	yeah project evaluation .
2185	Have fun .
2186	So
2187	, what are you going to do ?
2188	I do not know what product evaluation exactly means , but you will get the specifications .
2189	Kay .
2190	We do not have produ product yet , so kind of difficult .
2191	Yeah .
2192	That is why I
2193	But
2194	How long do we still have ?
2195	Yeah .
2196	You are fired .
2197	No
2198	but
2199	Well , can we talk about something else ?
2200	no I do not know anything ,
2201	but maybe anyone else
2202	Yeah ?
2203	Round I think .
2204	Yeah .
2205	Ajax .
2206	Will we use round buttons or square ones for the for the numbers ?
2207	Yeah
2208	I
2209	I
2210	I also thought Yeah .
2211	Nah .
2212	round .
2213	Yeah .
2214	Round .
2215	To make it as as round as possible .
2216	And these these s these buttons are more triangle ish shaped with a square one in the middle .
2217	Why does
2218	f fuck you .
2219	Curvy .
2220	Yeah .
2221	So you can see you have to up or down .
2222	Yeah .
2223	Yeah .
2224	But now I see the
2225	Well th th th th th that depends .
2226	And this must be volume I think , and this programme .
2227	Heh ?
2228	We ca not get Ts
2229	It does not work any more .
2230	Well most of the time up and down is programme and left and right are volume , I think .
2231	Yeah .
2232	Yeah , it depends , but
2233	If you turn up the volume , you always see this thingy go up .
2234	Well we
2235	We
2236	we j we will just give them an
2237	We will design it ,
2238	and then they can give comments on it .
2239	Yeah , that is right .
2240	Yeah .
2241	Yeah alright .
2242	Yeah .
2243	Okay .
2244	We ca not save them .
2245	So we will just have them standing there .
2246	Yeah , I noticed .
2247	You ca not click the corners .
2248	No .
2249	It is a bit bit a pity .
2250	It is a real real great thing .
2251	Well we still have more than five minutes .
2252	So
2253	what are we going to do ?
2254	I as Project Manager ha do not have a clue .
2255	Let is start the design .
2256	Oh we can decide how we implement the feeling from our company into the remote .
2257	Well yeah .
2258	I think a logo , our company logo , and the slogan should be or could be
2259	Yeah , why not ?
2260	If there is enough space , you can put
2261	We will we will
2262	Well , our slogan is not very long .
2263	Also the slogan ?
2264	On the
2265	We put the fashion in electronics .
2266	I I would say only the logo .
2267	O
2268	Yeah .
2269	Me too .
2270	Too much text
2271	and it gets too too busy .
2272	It is just
2273	a simple
2274	What is it ?
2275	You c
2276	But you can put it on the back , on the titanium part .
2277	Well it is quite a long phrase .
2278	We put the fashion in electronics .
2279	But we kree we keep adjusting to the fashion with our fronts .
2280	So
2281	Yeah , right .
2282	The logo and the and the
2283	Yeah they do .
2284	the logo should be on the top I think .
2285	The logo
2286	Yeah .
2287	On the top .
2288	Yeah .
2289	Well in in in the right top corner ?
2290	And well you c
2291	On the back , you can put h At the bottom , you can put the logo with the
2292	Yeah .
2293	Well yeah .
2294	Right corner , yes .
2295	Right corner , or maybe here in the middle ?
2296	Yeah
2297	it it should be hard on the on the on the board , and you can remove the front .
2298	the text ?
2299	Yeah .
2300	But the logo the logo should not be exchangeable , when you get off the front .
2301	Just just small .
2302	yeah , at the back ?
2303	Well you
2304	c
2305	Well Yes .
2306	Yeah well
2307	Carved into the material .
2308	Yeah .
2309	You can
2310	The logo can be on on every front .
2311	Yeah .
2312	Yeah ,
2313	but you can scratch it off or something .
2314	It is better if you have it
2315	Yeah .
2316	Yeah , but then you must really yeah push it in or something .
2317	No ,
2318	you you can carve it into the titanium at the back .
2319	I
2320	l
2321	I like the idea of the of the slogan on the on the on the thing .
2322	But am I the only one , or
2323	No not on the front , but on the backside .
2324	Yeah , on the backside .
2325	Well , management would like it .
2326	Well n n not not on the front side , I think .
2327	The front side , no no l no slogan .
2328	On the back
2329	Yes , you you can , yeah , push that in , so that it is always be there .
2330	I think it is a nice idea , to make it more recognisable ,
2331	that the next to the logo you have the slogan .
2332	Sorry .
2333	Yeah .
2334	I agree .
2335	To make more of an impression .
2336	But not too big .
2337	Just
2338	Yeah .
2339	Not too big .
2340	No ,
2341	very small .
2342	Not on the entire back , but just very small .
2343	But readable enough of course .
2344	Okay .
2345	Yes , slogan from company on the back with logo and logo also on the front but not exchange ? ? when changing fronts .
2346	But we will we will take that with us into the design .
2347	Yeah I think over here the logo .
2348	Lo yeah .
2349	Or maybe here in the middle ,
2350	but we will decide later .
2351	Alright , that is decided .
2352	Do you do you see a bit of the of the of the titanium ?
2353	O on the front ?
2354	maybe if we make this this this lower part titanium ,
2355	the front is the the upper part , and the the bit with the with the LCD screen .
2356	Five minutes left .
2357	Yes
2358	we could
2359	No , they have two fronts ,
2360	that .
2361	So Yeah .
2362	So a bit of titanium between ?
2363	That is a bit Oh that that is that is pretty cool .
2364	Yeah .
2365	No no betwe
2366	of between
2367	we can do
2368	but
2369	But then you have two parts of front , two fronts that
2370	This enti entire bottom ?
2371	And then the lower part is titanium ?
2372	I think that is nice , yeah .
2373	No no no no .
2374	You have to make this titanium too .
2375	You you can
2376	Yeah .
2377	No ?
2378	Yes .
2379	Yeah .
2380	Else you you get problems with the LCD .
2381	Yeah .
2382	Yeah .
2383	Like dust in it and so things like that .
2384	Yeah .
2385	When you exchange all the fronts and it is open .
2386	I already have all kinds of filth between the mobile .
2387	No , you can you can just
2388	And then not a straight line but some sort of wave or something .
2389	This is titanium .
2390	Yeah .
2391	And this is
2392	F front .
2393	Some some kind of wei weight in it .
2394	Yeah .
2395	Yeah .
2396	Round forms .
2397	Yeah .
2398	I like that bit of titanium also on the
2399	A bit like a bit like your mobile phone .
2400	Yeah .
2401	Yeah .
2402	With the with the curved edge .
2403	Yep .
2404	Maybe you can show it .
2405	Yeah .
2406	It also has the those two distinct bit like this .
2407	Yeah .
2408	Tada .
2409	Yeah .
2410	Yeah .
2411	Yeah ,
2412	you can make it go round this corner too where the logo is .
2413	it is
2414	Yeah yeah .
2415	Because it has to be there all the time you know .
2416	What ?
2417	So round where ?
2418	Oh , yeah .
2419	That
2420	Yeah .
2421	So a little corner of titanium .
2422	Maybe a nice touch , yeah .
2423	Yeah ,
2424	that is nice finishing touch you need .
2425	Yes , that also sounds pretty neat .
2426	So this this is the exchangeable part .
2427	I think I am going to buy it .
2428	We want it .
2429	Yeah , this is the front .
2430	And it is only f twenty five Euros .
2431	Come on .
2432	My design .
2433	That is a bit too much , but No , no no no ,
2434	but I think this looks pretty nice actually .
2435	No that is nothing .
2436	The Phillips remote costs more .
2437	Of course , because it is my design
2438	but No our d our design , alright .
2439	Right .
2440	Taking all the credit .
2441	Well you two are going to work together .
2442	You will get your specifications on your laptop ,
2443	and then you
2444	Well I think we can ,
2445	I just
2446	It is
2447	Yeah , o Oh
2448	Oh , we have a one .
2449	Yeah .
2450	We will stay here I guess ?
2451	Well we can erase an animal I guess .
2452	But there is a problem .
2453	We ca not take a blank one .
2454	Or can we ?
2455	Yeah .
2456	the fourth one .
2457	Nah that is alright , that is alright .
2458	But do not erase my cat .
2459	the fourth one is empty , is not it ?
2460	Yeah .
2461	I want to preserve it .
2462	This one is empty .
2463	Yeah .
2464	You have to empty one huh ?
2465	Alright .
2466	What are you doing chief ?
2467	Yeah
2468	until the until the beep goes .
2469	So , you can draw a Yeah .
2470	Yeah I think we have to wait ?
2471	Maybe .
2472	Well I will get a
2473	I will get the message .
2474	No
2475	Yeah .
2476	But I do not Do we have to stay here ,
2477	or I think we have to return first .
2478	No , I think
2479	Well
2480	you will
2481	Maybe you can keep your laptop here .
2482	Or get your mouse .
2483	Because it is little bit hard to work with these plates .
2484	The high powers from above will have to tell us , yeah .
2485	Yeah .
2486	It is not relaxing .
2487	I always have a mouse next to my laptop .
2488	I hate these
2489	Ugh .
2490	I I do not have a laptop .
2491	Yeah , touch pads , yeah .
2492	We can do a touch pad on our remote .
2493	Yeah right .
2494	No just kidding .
2495	Yeah .
2496	Dream on .
2497	Well we have b you have to have a bit of humour in the in the discussions too , because it becomes too too too too stressy .
2498	And in your remote control .
2499	So we put a touch pad on it , and say ha ha .
2500	Aha .
2501	This has no function .
2502	Half
2503	No .
2504	Yeah .
2505	We know you will you will you will hate it but
2506	But they do want some gadgets .
2507	But th youth does not care about functio functionality , so
2508	Yeah .
2509	It is all about cool things .
2510	So that is wha what we are doing .
2511	And it will sell .
2512	We will be rich .
2513	Bless you .
2514	Well we wo not .
2515	Our bosses will be rich .
2516	We have done too much in the previous meetings .
2517	Too much ?
2518	Well they
2519	I think that is good .
2520	Yes ,
2521	we have got nothing to do now .
2522	Well , that is not bad , is it ?
2523	No .
2524	We all had our talk and we agree I guess on several thing , on most on things .
2525	Its the best remote ever .
2526	So
2527	Oh .
2528	Pinball .
2529	Oh he is totally off again .
2530	Well
2531	But when I start here , it is here .
2532	No man .
2533	You just have to push harder .
2534	Yeah you have to push harder .
2535	So is it
2536	Nope .
2537	Yeah .
2538	Yes ,
2539	but you
2540	you get really close to the screen with your hand ,
2541	and I do not think that is
2542	Recalibrate it .
2543	Where is the good old chalk board with the the green board with the , how do you call it , chalk , yeah .
2544	Yeah .
2545	We can better draw a design on this .
2546	Yeah , maybe .
2547	Yeah , but we ca not .
2548	Maybe if i if that thing is recalibrated , we can draw a thing quick , and then before it goes off again .
2549	Yeah .
2550	Let is go .
2551	Well
2552	We will stay here ?
2553	Or we will get the email .
2554	Finish meeting now .
2555	Finish the meeting now .
2556	Alright now we know what to do , so
2557	Message ?
2558	No , get away .
2559	Yeah .
2560	Oh .
2561	Maybe w maybe we maybe w m
2562	Can we get email here ?
2563	Huh ?
2564	Yeah .
2565	Yeah .
2566	Guess so .
2567	I I am not sure .
2568	Maybe you
2569	Yeah .
2570	Well you will have to work on this one .
2571	Well we will wait a few seconds
2572	and then we will get an email .
2573	Yeah .
2574	That is a good idea .
2575	Alright .
2576	Well
2577	 
2578	fourth meeting .
2579	We have to do what ?
2580	Oh .
2581	Some extra deciding .
2582	W what ?
2583	Alri alright .
2584	Well
2585	I will show you the notes again .
2586	We will see .
2587	Very interesting .
2588	Well you will you two will present us your prototype .
2589	Yeah .
2590	Then I guess that is your bit ?
2591	I
2592	I did not s see anything about it ,
2593	so I already thought you you were to do that .
2594	Yeah .
2595	So the you are .
2596	I will show you how we are going to do with financing this design .
2597	Yeah , that is important too .
2598	Yeah .
2599	And then we will evaluate , after after we have redesigned it .
2600	Bit late .
2601	Because well we will see about the costs .
2602	we will evaluate our p our production and then we can close .
2603	Alright .
2604	Well the finance we will do later ,
2605	so firstly I will show you the notes .
2606	I do not think it is very interesting .
2607	I think it is .
2608	Oh nei .
2609	no .
2610	Alright .
2611	This is copy paste .
2612	So
2613	Of course .
2614	From me of course
2615	, yeah .
2616	You had some very strange layout .
2617	Well from us all , yeah , from all of us .
2618	Yeah .
2619	It is a nice chorus , yeah .
2620	Well
2621	We ge we went through the agenda , and well we had some some presentations from you three .
2622	And I summarised what you said to us .
2623	So I do not think it is very interesting and go through it again .
2624	Repeat it
2625	yeah .
2626	So
2627	This is what we decided .
2628	Alright .
2629	It is also copy paste from what we made together .
2630	So we still know that .
2631	Okay .
2632	And then we can we can use the time better .
2633	Well next you two will present the pot prototype for us .
2634	Alright , we both will ?
2635	Or one of us will ?
2636	Alright .
2637	Yeah .
2638	Alright .
2639	No you go
2640	and I will supplement you .
2641	If I make mistakes
2642	you will
2643	Right .
2644	Yeah .
2645	Correct .
2646	well
2647	this is our design .
2648	it is pretty much like Mike draw drew the in the during the last meeting .
2649	With the different perspectives of it .
2650	we will begin with the front .
2651	We have of course the the round shape the round basic shape .
2652	with the upper part being the front .
2653	Th
2654	So there is this part which is made of hard plastic , the front .
2655	And we are we are using different colours .
2656	Of course for the launch we use the basic ugly colours , and later we will put out more interesting covers with different patterns and pictures and everything .
2657	Yeah .
2658	But basically , different colours , bright colours not black , too dark .
2659	Fancy colours .
2660	then we have the lower part of the of the device .
2661	which is of course part of the back actually , because it is also titanium .
2662	You can see it also on the on the on the side view , that only this part is the front , and the rest of it , the under the under side of it , yeah , the back side and the lower part of the front is of course titanium made of titanium , and has the titanium colour of course , the look .
2663	then we have on back on the front the logo in the upper corner , which is made which is also part of the back , part of the titanium titanium part .
2664	Yeah , it is a double R , but It is a double R .
2665	Yeah ?
2666	It is a double R .
2667	Yeah the logo it is difficult to draw so small ,
2668	but it is our double R logo is in there .
2669	But it is very difficult to to draw that in
2670	Yeah .
2671	Yeah , alright .
2672	Okay .
2673	Yeah .
2674	so that is the logo in the upper lef right corner .
2675	Then we have the buttons .
2676	it is difficult to draw again the little oval or round
2677	I think oval will be better for the for the d for the different channel buttons .
2678	Oval
2679	yeah .
2680	Alright .
2681	So oval , n those are here .
2682	And then we have the m The m
2683	Yeah
2684	the the con the the the , yeah , the t volume and the channel controls in the middle here .
2685	Channel up and volume ?
2686	Yeah .
2687	with kind of arrow shapes ,
2688	which makes it also a bit more exciting than basic round or square buttons .
2689	And also here are the two buttons we agreed on .
2690	We have the Okay button .
2691	Oh nei
2692	we the Okay button is here in the middle of the of the operators , of the channel and volume changers .
2693	And then we have here the Menu button
2694	and the
2695	And the video button .
2696	Alright .
2697	Menu for the LCD screen .
2698	The
2699	Yeah .
2700	right .
2701	So Kay .
2702	And of course this low part , this is the LCD screen .
2703	this is what we made of it .
2704	You can make suggestions if you want .
2705	Well if I look at it , the side the side view
2706	Oh yeah alright .
2707	Well , at the back
2708	Yeah .
2709	Maybe we maybe we should finish first our talk and then you can add suggestions .
2710	Maybe I
2711	I do not want to
2712	I do not want to suppress you
2713	but n I will finish this quick .
2714	Yeah .
2715	okay I have had everything I guess on the front ?
2716	Yeah the back .
2717	No the back .
2718	With the logo and our l
2719	No I do not think
2720	And the
2721	And about the side view This the front wo not be as thick , but again th the the drawing technique makes it very difficult to to really
2722	Well , it wo not be visible .
2723	Yeah .
2724	We thought about
2725	Yeah , the back is of course totally titanium .
2726	And we thought about the logo big in the middle .
2727	Just so again the double R .
2728	We have then the logo on front and on the back .
2729	Maybe that is too much
2730	but you have to say say that if you think that way .
2731	Okay .
2732	And the company slogan , we thought in a kind of arc shape above the logo .
2733	Yeah .
2734	Yeah .
2735	That is basically what we were thinking about ,
2736	and
2737	Oh and before I forget .
2738	Okay .
2739	W
2740	Well I see , but
2741	Well .
2742	Yeah the the voice , of course , the voice recorder is at the bottom .
2743	Yeah I see it .
2744	Yes .
2745	And you can record it using , yeah , the the the back of the f w device .
2746	When I look at when I look at this side view , I think w when I have that in my hand
2747	, it is terrible .
2748	Yeah .
2749	If if you look if if this this is thick , and this is thin , th th then it that it lies over your hands .
2750	Why ?
2751	Well it fits it it
2752	it
2753	it fits the hand ,
2754	mean the the the the
2755	In the middle in the
2756	That is the question .
2757	But Well what what what
2758	I what I agree is that when when you have such of an arc in the middle , so that the the a the ends and the fronts is a bit thicker , so th then it falls over your hands .
2759	Yeah , I agree .
2760	If y
2761	If you handle a remote , you you usually do not have your hand straight like this .
2762	You you have it a bit
2763	Yeah .
2764	It depends on the size .
2765	If it is kind of small , this is is great .
2766	But if it is it is larger , then you want to grab it .
2767	And how large is it ?
2768	Well
2769	Well the sides I have not seen yet , ?
2770	They the the the the the side view ,
2771	we did not
2772	Yeah .
2773	Yeah .
2774	Yeah , that is the question .
2775	well Yeah .
2776	H
2777	What do you suggest
2778	I mean we do ?
2779	This was Mike is prototype , and
2780	y you seemed to agreed on it .
2781	But now you have a totally different .
2782	Well , they lay there all the time .
2783	The size ?
2784	Yeah well the size does not really matter
2785	w
2786	I mean
2787	Side ?
2788	oh the side ?
2789	W
2790	we we
2791	he drew the s the side , but you d you were not paying attention as usual .
2792	Yeah yeah .
2793	Well any case , we will discuss it now .
2794	I think this is a pretty good good idea .
2795	Yeah , I agree with the LCD screen .
2796	You have it in your palm like this , and you can watch watch the screen .
2797	And if you have it li in the middle , your hand might be over it .
2798	But you you hold it like this .
2799	Yeah
2800	you you do not you do not grab it ,
2801	you you
2802	Yeah .
2803	You are not holding it like this or something .
2804	You , yeah ,
2805	y
2806	How do you call it ?
2807	Yeah .
2808	Well y y y
2809	you do not have it like this .
2810	You have it more like this .
2811	No no no .
2812	You you you are using buttons this way , or if you are right handed , this way .
2813	Like you are holding your telephone .
2814	Yep .
2815	So you
2816	Yeah .
2817	Because if you have a screen on it , you want to look at your screen .
2818	So
2819	Yeah well
2820	And maybe you can you can grab it a bit higher ,
2821	so Well
2822	Well the the Well that is a reason to to to put the LCD screen of course on the upper side , but If necessary .
2823	That way , it it falls into your hand .
2824	I think .
2825	Okay .
2826	Yeah , I agree on this .
2827	No , I do not think so .
2828	That is not the point
2829	And you might be You might be target customer .
2830	No
2831	but but
2832	Well f for as far as I can see , three of us agree and only Nils
2833	But you are the Project Manager , you can make the hard decisions .
2834	Yeah well
2835	I think if you t if you three agree then then that is it .
2836	Yes .
2837	So I c
2838	I c
2839	Well , we will we we will do it like this .
2840	But are d Can you live with it ?
2841	Y Yeah ,
2842	y y
2843	y
2844	y
2845	you said it was totally unusable .
2846	Yeah ?
2847	Alright , if you think that that is the way
2848	it should
2849	No No ,
2850	when I I my personal taste is that I want it to fall over my hands with a thick
2851	But In the market
2852	No not totally .
2853	But do you
2854	But d you do not think this is completely unusable I guess .
2855	I think .
2856	Not totally , well
2857	Yeah
2858	but of course
2859	y you are also human .
2860	For me , I I would not buy it .
2861	Let is say it like that .
2862	We have to take every everyone into account .
2863	No
2864	Yes
2865	but
2866	Yeah , we do not know ,
2867	but that is that is that is that is more market research .
2868	So
2869	Yeah .
2870	Well who who else thinks like you ?
2871	We do not know .
2872	Maybe a thousand people , or a million people .
2873	So let it be like this at at this moment .
2874	Let it be .
2875	Alright .
2876	Okay ?
2877	No , I think it is great .
2878	So that is that .
2879	any other suggestions ?
2880	You are very personal again .
2881	Yeah .
2882	But what about the redesigning ?
2883	Okay .
2884	Comes to that later .
2885	you .
2886	c You can Walter .
2887	You can do the evaluation criteria on this ?
2888	That is more useful than just speaking .
2889	Alright .
2890	Great .
2891	Well , this is just a short intro .
2892	I am going to do the ev evaluation .
2893	Yes .
2894	That is going to be done at the end of seven point skill criteria .
2895	So I made a I made a few questions on the hand of the impor most important requirements and trends .
2896	And we have to look if our if our device is working correctly .
2897	Well , I put some questions in a Word file .
2898	See if I can find them .
2899	Kay .
2900	Well
2901	I think you have all seen this kind of evaluation , so I do not have to explain it .
2902	the first question is , is the device good looking ?
2903	Because normal p most people thought that earlier devices were ugly ugly .
2904	Seventy five percent of them .
2905	So what do we think ?
2906	Yeah
2907	No , I know ,
2908	but I have to evaluate it .
2909	Well d we designed it ,
2910	so of course we are very
2911	Yeah .
2912	Yeah , we are we are not quite objective about this .
2913	Well we designed it to be good looking .
2914	So I have to take this questionnaire .
2915	So and we ha we have answer now ?
2916	Yeah .
2917	To the customers ?
2918	To potential customers who have to take this questionnaire ?
2919	Nei .
2920	Yeah
2921	Yeah ,
2922	but I ca not can s
2923	Yeah ,
2924	but , you know We dis we di
2925	we designed it to be perfect .
2926	Oh no .
2927	I know , I know , I know .
2928	But Well we can go , because of the time , pretty quick through this .
2929	do we find it good looking ?
2930	Well we think so .
2931	I
2932	Yeah , I think it
2933	Well l well let is start with the beginning , just one by one .
2934	Yeah .
2935	Yeah .
2936	We designed it to be good looking , so
2937	So But we have to be critic critical about it .
2938	And I have to take all these points and get a average at the end .
2939	So we we know where we stand .
2940	Well , one .
2941	Cause th there are some things we might have bi might have forgotten .
2942	Well so it is point four .
2943	Right , so Right .
2944	Easy to find t
2945	Two .
2946	is it good looking ?
2947	The titanium might be f for older people .
2948	Well , I guess I think it is
2949	it is it is pointed towards the youth of course , if you look at the design and and the colours and everything .
2950	That was our target audience of course .
2951	But it is also not completely u unacceptable for older people I guess .
2952	it is it is not f a device that
2953	Yeah , that is that is for older people ,
2954	it is it is more that classical look .
2955	It you put put a black front on it or something .
2956	So
2957	no .
2958	I think
2959	Yeah they like black of course , but I think they will they
2960	they think the the titanium look of it is also
2961	I think it is also good for them ,
2962	so I think we both have consider considered the youth and also a bit older people .
2963	So I think it is very good looking and not only for youth young people .
2964	Right .
2965	I think we should not discuss any points points that long ,
2966	because I do not know how how many points there are but
2967	Right .
2968	No .
2969	I totally agree .
2970	Yeah , the fourteen yeah .
2971	We we have to get get on , go through this .
2972	Right , a number please .
2973	Yeah .
2974	Is it easy to t change channels ?
2975	Yeah well I think so .
2976	So the last one is seven .
2977	Easy to change channels ?
2978	Oh , sorry .
2979	, no it is
2980	With two huge buttons .
2981	No , not false .
2982	It is one .
2983	Yeah , right .
2984	Well two ?
2985	Y
2986	Well we have to go through it .
2987	Change channels ?
2988	Right .
2989	I think it is as easy as can be made .
2990	So I
2991	Yeah .
2992	You How can you make it any easier ?
2993	Yeah , huge is a Yeah .
2994	The power , channel and volume buttons are easy accessible ?
2995	Two ?
2996	Alright .
2997	Yep .
2998	Two .
2999	The device is easy to find if you lose it ?
3000	Yeah .
3001	Well , no .
3002	D we d we do not we do not have that s
3003	Yeah .
3004	We did not implement anything about that .
3005	Well it is easier to find than a a normal black one or something , because of the colour .
3006	But We have so few functions ,
3007	so Yeah .
3008	Well six then .
3009	Six ?
3010	Right .
3011	Well we do not have the device that beeps when you lost it or so ,
3012	but
3013	Yeah .
3014	Are the functions easy to learn ?
3015	Well w I we do want we have a l f f less of an
3016	And the device RSI sensitive ?
3017	Yeah .
3018	Yeah , I agree .
3019	Well , I should I think two ,
3020	because the voice recorder is n not self learning .
3021	Yeah .
3022	Yeah .
3023	Alright .
3024	Are we take too much time ?
3025	Yeah , very much .
3026	Two ?
3027	Yeah
3028	Yeah , I agree .
3029	Yeah , but just do some We we
3030	I th
3031	I th
3032	I think this is too time consuming .
3033	not not towards you , but towards this all .
3034	No .
3035	Th this is
3036	We you have to put it to the customers .
3037	Yeah .
3038	Right ,
3039	R RSI sensitive ?
3040	RSI sensitive ?
3041	Four .
3042	well well a bit , so four .
3043	Yeah .
3044	Yes .
3045	One .
3046	One .
3047	And features included also one .
3048	And One .
3049	those nine is the fancy looking .
3050	we still think so .
3051	Yeah .
3052	Device fancy feeling .
3053	And I think fancy feeling too ,
3054	because of the titanium back .
3055	Yeah , cool man .
3056	Yeah .
3057	Yeah .
3058	Right .
3059	Are there enough technology ?
3060	Yeah well also we have two .
3061	Yeah .
3062	Yeah , that is great .
3063	Is the device easy to use ?
3064	Yes
3065	we have not many buttons .
3066	The
3067	Two two .
3068	So well maybe two
3069	because of the voice recorder .
3070	Well , with the
3071	Three .
3072	Two , three .
3073	T
3074	Yeah .
3075	Are the trends about fruit and vegetables implemented ?
3076	Well in our covers , in our fronts .
3077	F
3078	Yeah .
3079	So yes , one .
3080	One or two .
3081	Oh okay .
3082	One or two , another two .
3083	Yeah .
3084	Nah f four I think .
3085	Four ?
3086	Well , it does not really resemble any fruit , that is true .
3087	If you look at this
3088	No .
3089	But but we have the the the the the sparkly fruity colours of course .
3090	Well three .
3091	Three , alright .
3092	Okay .
3093	And you can also have front with with fruit on it .
3094	Yeah , that is true .
3095	Is the material attractive ?
3096	Well the titanium is strong , and the rest f the buttons feel soft .
3097	But
3098	Right .
3099	Yeah .
3100	So I would say at least two .
3101	Okay .
3102	Well Yeah .
3103	This is the last meeting ?
3104	Yeah .
3105	Yes , but we we have to design much more , because there was some irritating account manager coming to me .
3106	The average will come later .
3107	I knew things were going too smoothly .
3108	Oh .
3109	There had to be some kind of trouble along the way .
3110	Yes .
3111	Yeah .
3112	Well ,
3113	look at the costs at this point .
3114	My god .
3115	I had to fit it in .
3116	It has to go to twelve , right ?
3117	Twelve and a half .
3118	I twelve and a half .
3119	So
3120	Well what costs a lot ?
3121	The sample spea costs four .
3122	The what ?
3123	The
3124	Yeah w tha that is that is a bit an optional option .
3125	The sample speaker , the s sensor .
3126	Out .
3127	That is easy .
3128	Kick it out .
3129	Kick it out .
3130	The what ?
3131	Oh .
3132	Yeah .
3133	We have to go to twelve and a half .
3134	The speaker .
3135	The speaker costs far , by far the most .
3136	That is some wrong info , man .
3137	It it is not worth it .
3138	No .
3139	No .
3140	No , d th No .
3141	We could make two different versions , one with and one without .
3142	It is
3143	It is just extra .
3144	But for this
3145	So , zero .
3146	Kick it out .
3147	Yeah .
3148	Then we go to fourteen point six .
3149	What more ?
3150	Batteries are quite
3151	no , no no no .
3152	Well the titanium I do not want to lose actually .
3153	No .
3154	LC three ?
3155	Yeah hand dynamo ?
3156	Y t come on ,
3157	w a remote control has a battery .
3158	Well well why why why should we use a advanced chip ?
3159	Yeah ?
3160	Ca not we do that with a regular chip ?
3161	Why not ?
3162	Yeah .
3163	N
3164	well we have a bit of a problem I think .
3165	Because
3166	the LCD screen .
3167	Well be for the LCD you had said .
3168	Yeah .
3169	No .
3170	Because that y
3171	because my information says it .
3172	Well what what is the difference between simple and regular ?
3173	What is the difference between a simple and a regular chip ?
3174	And simple ?
3175	Nothing .
3176	Huh ?
3177	well yeah
3178	I
3179	I read something about it , but
3180	Yeah ,
3181	I
3182	I read something about it ,
3183	but it was not very clear .
3184	Regular is normal .
3185	Yeah .
3186	Simple .
3187	Elementary .
3188	Well ?
3189	Your part .
3190	I d I did not in include it in my report .
3191	What happens if we do
3192	How much do we win ?
3193	One .
3194	Single
3195	Well you have to use a chip .
3196	So Well you have to use the advanced chip , if you have the LCD screen .
3197	We we we
3198	Why ?
3199	We have very little options furthermore ,
3200	for the
3201	well we have to put that in .
3202	But if you have a regular chip , you ca not have the LCD screen .
3203	Yeah .
3204	Yeah , we need to have the the LCD screen .
3205	That that is a fact .
3206	Well , we could say , well this special colour , that is not that that is not there ,
3207	because the the fronts they will buy it .
3208	Yeah , but it is only one half .
3209	No
3210	Yeah ,
3211	but No , that is
3212	n It is not relevant .
3213	The special colour .
3214	Nah .
3215	it
3216	d it does not
3217	But we d Then we have to lose the LCD screen .
3218	Yeah ,
3219	then you s then you only have one half left .
3220	Yeah , you must change the chip back .
3221	You must change the chip back , Nils .
3222	Yeah .
3223	yeah .
3224	No , Then the whole concept is
3225	You
3226	You can make you can make it cheaper .
3227	Yeah , I know
3228	but that is what my information says .
3229	I di
3230	I did not put the advanced chip in there for fun .
3231	No we
3232	oh
3233	You you we have an advanced chip on print , and we have an LC display .
3234	You have to use it .
3235	But if you do not sell
3236	No
3237	no no no .
3238	Yeah .
3239	I think that is a bit double .
3240	Yeah ?
3241	No ,
3242	the advanced chip is needed to have an LCD display .
3243	Y we do not need both .
3244	For the LCD screen .
3245	Yeah .
3246	Yeah .
3247	Says .
3248	Says , his that was in the second meeting , I think .
3249	Well and what do they mean with curves again ?
3250	Because we you have uncurved
3251	Yeah .
3252	Well I I did single curve to
3253	Well you said s double curved ,
3254	he ,
3255	because I thought it is a b a bit cheaper already .
3256	I ?
3257	One curve .
3258	We can also make it flat .
3259	Well But what what did what do
3260	n
3261	Sorry ,
3262	but What do they mean with the curves ?
3263	Is th Is this a curve ?
3264	One curve ?
3265	Yeah , this is actually two curves , yeah .
3266	But
3267	Curved ?
3268	Yes , that is curved .
3269	Yes .
3270	It is how you It is how you look at it .
3271	No , it is one curve .
3272	One curve , simple .
3273	Well then we have a huge problem I think .
3274	W t we can never get below the twelve and a half .
3275	We have a big financial problem .
3276	Well we make it more expensive to buy .
3277	Well , then we have two dollars less profit .
3278	Come on ,
3279	if we if we if we make this fifty million , they wo not hesitate to congratulate us , so By the way , we also have this one .
3280	If if you make people brand aware , they are willing to pay more .
3281	But Because we we use a brand at the front and I dun at the back .
3282	But I
3283	Hey but I think you will agree that that we that now we have this screen , it is it is very not practical to ha to consider this after we have designed the entire thing .
3284	If you have lots of marketing people might buy .
3285	Yeah or we could replace it
3286	Why why do not we replace the titanium with plastic coloured titanium , titanium coloured plastic ?
3287	Yeah well if we we we have to get cheaper .
3288	If you if you make it cool to have
3289	Oh , that is just great .
3290	Oh , costs nothing .
3291	Oh , alright .
3292	That is nice .
3293	Plastic is
3294	Yes ,
3295	but I just got it .
3296	Well that is pretty l
3297	N not very practical .
3298	That is pretty stupid .
3299	Well But I am
3300	n I do not agree .
3301	Who ?
3302	You want to dump the titanium ?
3303	And make all plastic , then we ha then we are there .
3304	But then we we have got to run through the eval evaluation process again .
3305	I think
3306	I think the titanium just provided the the tough look and the and the And also the the older people will like it because of that .
3307	Th then you have a ugly , stupid , l ugly looking , dumb remote that that no one would buy .
3308	no no .
3309	It is not ugly looking .
3310	The looks remain the same .
3311	No , I do not think so .
3312	Y
3313	Yeah , I agree .
3314	Well , I do think so .
3315	Yes .
3316	And the feel , and th that it is strong , and
3317	We still
3318	we had to focus to get more people from the younger group , but not lose the one
3319	Why ca not I
3320	I will put in the report we that we think that fourteen point one is the l m lowest price you can make a remote for that is trendy d these days .
3321	feel .
3322	And because i
3323	Alright it is not our target audience , but it is it is useful if it is important for old people .
3324	Yeah .
3325	I think the titanium is very important .
3326	Yeah alright
3327	but then we we wo not get there .
3328	Yeah we have a problem , yeah .
3329	W
3330	But you can better , yeah , dump the LCD screen then .
3331	We can dump the special colour .
3332	We l we use plastic .
3333	And plastic is already in colour
3334	I think .
3335	I do not think you should dump the LCD screen .
3336	Well what else ?
3337	W I mean
3338	Yeah .
3339	No , nothing .
3340	Or you shou
3341	It is
3342	Or change the titanium or dump the LCD screen .
3343	Amen .
3344	But I think you could better change titanium to hard a hard kind of plastic looking like titanium than lose the LCD screen .
3345	Yeah .
3346	Because you have lots of functions in it too .
3347	Yeah ,
3348	well yeah .
3349	Yeah .
3350	Alright .
3351	I agree with that .
3352	But
3353	No no no no .
3354	So we u we use Unfortunately .
3355	Titanium coloured plastic .
3356	Yeah , I agree .
3357	So titanium coloured plastic for the back .
3358	I I will talk to the managers .
3359	W Titanium stays there .
3360	Titanium , I thi
3361	I think
3362	this
3363	this is this is e really good re remote .
3364	Yeah this is good , but
3365	it it is not good enough .
3366	Osl

3375	What do we
3376	Well what do we know ?
3377	All we want is a is a fancy design
3378	but we do not really consider the costs .

3380	Yes , yes .
3381	So

3386	Well , no it is just all plastic .
3387	So s
3388	If you do not have the money , you ca not make it .
3389	So
3390	So
3391	Titanium gone and add plastic .
3392	So this is too expensive .
3393	So we have to make it cheaper .
3394	Right .
3395	Yeah , but then we have got money left .
3396	And on plastic times two
3397	and then we are there ?
3398	No

3401	well
3402	Oh six .
3403	Well alright .

3405	A lot of plastic , yeah .
3406	It is just free , man .
3407	Four .
3408	So
3409	But then we can add the special colour ?
3410	As we have money over left .
3411	No two for the to make it clear .
3412	Yeah .
3413	Yeah .
3414	And we still have money left .
3415	W

3421	We have we have to fill W we ha
3422	No no no ,
3423	but th that is not f
3424	Well you can you can double curve , if you do not have titanium .
3425	Yeah right .
3426	I want chrome .
3427	Because you y have that curve and you have that curve .
3428	Y Oh no .
3429	Yeah well
3430	Well y we have curves in all directions .
3431	Well , th that that is the problem .
3432	Alright .
3433	Safe .
3434	And that we dropped , so it it can be done .
3435	So alright .
3436	But it is pretty funny .
3437	We we do want to reach twelve point five .
3438	But it is not bad to to to stay at eleven .
3439	Finance ?
3440	Well , guys ?
3441	Guys ?
3442	We have to dump our titanium , and we will hate the managers for that , but now we are going to evaluate our project , of project ,
3443	project .
3444	I mean , this this ai not titanium , but it looks like it .
3445	We get more salary , if we make if cheaper than twelve twelve and a half .
3446	Yeah .
3447	Shoot .
3448	Objection .
3449	Pro project .
3450	Well , satisfaction on for example ,
3451	are we satisfactory about our creativity ?
3452	I think it is terrible that we got those costs at the last moment .
3453	Well I ca not get no satisfaction , but
3454	I think it is
3455	Well in in if we consider the costs then this is the best , yeah .
3456	Yeah .
3457	Yeah .
3458	Yeah .
3459	Yeah , me too .
3460	That is really bad .
3461	Its it is ridiculous actually , but Which is not very practical ,
3462	but that is the way .
3463	But that that that is that , yeah
3464	that is a reason , but also for our creativity .
3465	And unrealistic .
3466	We had nice design , and then you get the cost , and you had to dump all your creativity .
3467	Well we we we used our creativity , but we just had to adapt it to the costs .
3468	Right .
3469	Yeah .
3470	Nei .
3471	no .
3472	Well , alright .
3473	Uh huh .
3474	leadership next .
3475	Terrible .
3476	teamwork ?

3479	Leadership .
3480	Leadership ?
3481	Well
3482	Yeah .
3483	Well it is It was very democratic .
3484	Yeah .
3485	I
3486	al I
3487	I have filled that in in a the questionnaires each time , so
3488	Well the managers were terrible .
3489	Yeah yeah .
3490	So , with their all their useless requirements .
3491	But o alright , the teamwork ?
3492	No
3493	they said , oh we wo not d we wo not use teletext , we wo not use the DVD .
3494	Well they they did not think of the requirements .
3495	It is the requirements of the user , I guess .
3496	Yeah .
3497	Yeah
3498	but they base that on on the user specifications .
3499	Alright ,
3500	teamwork ?
3501	Well great I think .
3502	Well
3503	Yeah , think so too .
3504	Right
3505	yeah .
3506	well what do you , what did you think about the SMARTboard ?
3507	Well
3508	It is also a It is both the SMARTboards .
3509	It was a complete disaster .
3510	No it
3511	it
3512	it
3513	it is
3514	No it is other way around .
3515	Yeah , I do not like it .
3516	No ,
3517	that is a SMARTboard , and that is a digital pen .
3518	Yeah ?
3519	This this this is not a SMARTboard , right ?
3520	Yeah right .
3521	Or not ?
3522	Oh they are both SMARTboards .
3523	That is the SMARTboard .
3524	That is the digital panel .
3525	I liked this SMARTboard , but I hated that one .
3526	Well it is both a SMARTboard .
3527	That is that is the smart
3528	A televi
3529	Yeah .
3530	B but you
3531	This is just a large t large television .
3532	No .
3533	You u you use the Yeah , but you ca
3534	This is just a beamer function .
3535	It is both a SMARTboard , but this one is used for a desktop , and that one is used to to draw .
3536	And here , on this one , you can draw the pictures and things like that .
3537	Well , wi w which one did you like ?
3538	That one .
3539	But That one .
3540	Yeah .
3541	Left or right ?
3542	Well I did not use
3543	Nei It it is much m
3544	But you can
3545	I
3546	I sent it about three times now .
3547	Yeah .
3548	That one is not accurate .
3549	It just does not work .
3550	Yeah .
3551	You can
3552	Yeah ,
3553	but I think there is a big distinction between the these th I do not need a SMARTboard .
3554	But I I think this is meant by the digital pen .
3555	Yes .
3556	Th that is so .
3557	Yeah .
3558	We are now talking about the SMARTboards .
3559	Well we we used that one , and we needed it .
3560	Yeah ,
3561	but give me a beamer .
3562	I think .
3563	That is that is much much cheaper .
3564	Yeah alright ,
3565	but Yeah I like that one , but that one is terrible .
3566	Or install a laptop to a beamer , or have this one standing here in an
3567	I I like it .
3568	Right .
3569	Okay , alright .
3570	a green board with chalk is much more useful than that thing .
3571	Yeah .
3572	Yeah .
3573	Yeah , it is .
3574	The simple sch school board .
3575	So
3576	And the digi the digital pen ?
3577	Did did you like that one ?
3578	I used it just to check it out , but You you ca not send that to anyone , because you you have scrabbled something on a page for yourself , and then you are going to send it , yeah .
3579	I agree .
3580	No .
3581	I
3582	I did not use it .
3583	I wrote things down
3584	but I did not import it into my laptop .
3585	Yeah .
3586	That is the
3587	W
3588	But also y you write things down .
3589	Yeah .
3590	It is not practical .
3591	Right .
3592	Well , no .
3593	And i you can also bring your your your note block .
3594	Your notepad .
3595	So what is the what is the th what is the point of importing it into
3596	Yeah alright .
3597	Yeah .
3598	It is , no , it it is useless .
3599	Well I I drew this .
3600	And I made a mistake .
3601	But it it would have been useful , if I I could show this on the screen .
3602	Yes .
3603	For drawings , yes .
3604	For drawings ,
3605	but not for personal notes .
3606	Yeah for drawings .
3607	I think that is not very
3608	I mean you can bring your paperwork along and p
3609	Well of course if you have a lot of paper
3610	If you have If you have
3611	Yeah I understand .
3612	N notes .
3613	But
3614	But for notes , it i you you have to put that in a strict you have to put a name , standard date , and all those things .
3615	Yeah , it might be useful for drawings .
3616	I I agree on that .
3617	And notes for a meeting are very strict .
3618	So if you were to write them down for yourself , and then put that in your computer , you still have to type it over to Word .
3619	Yeah , right .
3620	So it does not d does not have any
3621	Yep .
3622	That Stefan use .
3623	But I think d this option is only useful if you have got a lot of paperwork .
3624	You ca not It is not very ni
3625	Yeah well a lot of documents are
3626	Yeah .
3627	No , I do not think so .
3628	It is it is only useful if you have to draw something .
3629	Yeah .
3630	But then it is really useful , I think .
3631	Yeah .
3632	Alright .
3633	Mu Yeah right .
3634	etcetera ?
3635	Well the laptops ?
3636	Of course great .
3637	Yeah , great .
3638	Yeah .
3639	Yeah .
3640	Can we keep them ? .
3641	Yeah .
3642	You can .
3643	B by my
3644	Yeah .
3645	Wireless wireless things .
3646	Thanks Project Manager .
3647	Other things we used here ?
3648	I hated the cameras , I hated the microphones .
3649	Well these chairs , man .
3650	But No
3651	No .
3652	Well did you really Did you really take take those in account ?
3653	I half of time I did not notice they were there .
3654	Really great .
3655	No .
3656	I have not looked w one time directly at the camera .
3657	So
3658	But we should not talk about that .
3659	I do not care about it .
3660	Well I did .
3661	Because this is a realistic environment .
3662	Well w why not ?
3663	etcetera We
3664	N new ideas found ?
3665	What kind of ideas for n a future schedule
3666	What ?
3667	For future meetings you have got ?
3668	Chatting and emailing .
3669	Right .
3670	Okay .
3671	Well I missed the option to to email ,
3672	yeah .
3673	Communicate in between .
3674	Email or chat or something .
3675	Yeah , right .
3676	But yeah .
3677	W well th that is just the the environment they set us up
3678	f with .
3679	Yeah .
3680	So
3681	Well , for drawing for drawings .
3682	Yeah alright ,
3683	but that is one n new idea .
3684	Yeah , I agree .
3685	Well , new ideas found by this .
3686	Not .
3687	Nothing .
3688	Well , more more information in the beginning .
3689	We do not want this .
3690	We hate this .
3691	Yeah .
3692	That is
3693	For people who sketch th the whole day , I can imagine that it is useful .
3694	Digital pen is useless .
3695	No it is not .
3696	So Yeah , for drawings .
3697	Yeah .
3698	Yeah .
3699	So it is not useless .
3700	But two t
3701	But th then you have to have a lot of drawings , because if I had a company and I am going to buy those expensive huge expensive things , I and I have to w pay those papers that are expensive , I am not going to
3702	Well th then still
3703	they they
3704	they should have a a nice graphics programme on the laptop .
3705	Well No
3706	But it is still an expensive expensive
3707	But if w Yeah .
3708	Yeah .
3709	Because this is huge this v very very expensive paper .
3710	Well
3711	Yeah , I agree .
3712	Well you you ca not you ca not draw on a laptop like you like you paint of or draw with your hand .
3713	With the mouse it is No .
3714	Yeah .
3715	Well and if
3716	And but what if maybe this this board SMARTboard is malfunctioning or someone .
3717	Mouse is ju just is not working if you are sketching .
3718	indeed .
3719	But suppose it was working correctly ,
3720	what would it be useful then , if it was not off all the time ?
3721	A
3722	Really ?
3723	Anything you want .
3724	Well no .
3725	I hated to draw like that .
3726	You you ca not draw anything neat .
3727	Yeah , but he is saying if it is correct , and you can draw very , yeah , very precise
3728	Yeah , mu
3729	It saves time .
3730	Any b b Yeah .
3731	I if it if it would be perfect following .
3732	L li li
3733	Yeah .
3734	Well th th then still it is it is it is very expensive towards a a just a green school board .
3735	Well it is not ,
3736	but maybe that thing is is
3737	Yeah , board , a school board ,
3738	yeah .
3739	Yeah ,
3740	but but then you can save it in instantly , and and and re use it , and
3741	Yeah .
3742	Yep .
3743	I it has It is useful .
3744	Yeah .
3745	Yeah yeah .
3746	This if it works correct ,
3747	maybe this thing this thing is just malfunctioning .
3748	So if we get in if we get another one
3749	and you make sure it does work ,
3750	I think then it is pretty useful .
3751	Yep .
3752	Yeah .
3753	Because yeah you can draw t things quickly and clearly for anyone in the discussion room .
3754	And then you can save it immediately .
3755	Well , they are now .
3756	Celebration .
3757	It is .
3758	So , congratulations crew .

3947	Okay .
3948	Nice .
3949	Oh .
3950	Very good .
3951	blank .
3952	Thank you .
3953	Okay .
3954	Very good .
3955	So you can always go back .
3956	So
3957	That is it .
3958	So that was two .
3959	Now next .
3960	The budget .
3961	The b
3962	we will sell the t at twenty five Euros .
3963	And we have only twenty of twelve and a half Euro to make it .
3964	So
3965	now we have to think about what we will make .
3966	First I want to hear from you .
3967	what are your experiences with remote controls .
3968	So
3969	F first .
3970	I will start .
3971	Big one , they are not easy to use .
3972	I have one set and a remote control , when I dropped it , it broke .
3973	So that wo not be our goal , I think .
3974	No .
3975	And g big buttons ,
3976	m that is easier to use than I think .
3977	Not all the small buttons , you do not know Big buttons , positive .
3978	Is this positive or negative , that big buttons ?
3979	Positive .
3980	All all small buttons like when you have like a hundred buttons on your remote control , you wo not know what they are working for .
3981	Okay .
3982	What are your experiences ?
3983	well I think the the the goal of a remote control is that it is it it has an influence on the TV set .
3984	And that it controls the channels and the the volume .
3985	And I I
3986	I think it is positive if there is a a LED a LED on the corner of the of the remote .
3987	So that you know it s it still has batteries on it in it .
3988	And that if you push the button the LED gives a light , and and you see that it is working .
3989	And yeah .
3990	Yeah , but
3991	No no no .
3992	So and do they always have that ?
3993	It is easy to you .
3994	But I my my experience is that it
3995	it
3996	it is convenient to have that .
3997	Yeah .
3998	Okay .
3999	Yeah .
4000	Kay .
4001	at home we have a TV , a video recorder , a DVD player , and a satellite receiver .
4002	We have four distinctive remote controls for that .
4003	Thank you .
4004	That is not really ea easy .
4005	Help also .
4006	So it would be nice if we have one for all .
4007	Thank you .
4008	And we also had a remote control for our radio set .
4009	But i it it had a lot of buttons on it , and you did not know which one was what .
4010	And it was v not easy to use .
4011	So we n barely used it .
4012	Okay so they have too much .
4013	So next .
4014	For our own remote control we have to think how do we make it .
4015	So what ideas do you have for it , for the new remote control ?
4016	What what does it have to have ?
4017	Not too heavy .
4018	The weight .
4019	Not not too heavy .
4020	Not much buttons .
4021	Yes .
4022	Yeah .
4023	Bust free .
4024	That when you drop it , it wo not break .
4025	Like some kind of rubber on it .
4026	Or hard hard plastic .
4027	buttons not too small .
4028	something like when you lose your remote control , sometimes it happen .
4029	Yes .
4030	it between the couch and you ca not find it .
4031	When you push a but a button on the TV , then you hear some some sort of bleep .
4032	Like a phone .
4033	And then you , hey there there is remote control .
4034	Yeah .
4035	Okay .
4036	Yeah .
4037	So ,
4038	that is .
4039	Next .
4040	Yeah well that is that are good ideas .
4041	Yeah well the LED on the corner , that that indicates that it is working .
4042	If you push a button .
4043	Yeah .
4044	And looking on the budget , not too expensive material .
4045	So probably plastic or something .
4046	no .
4047	Okay .
4048	Yeah I think it from a marketing point of view , it also has to look nice .
4049	Or you wo not sell it .
4050	Yes .
4051	And yeah
4052	on our website we can see what products we already have .
4053	And it should work with as many as possible of them .
4054	Okay .
4055	This is It has to be compatible with other things .
4056	Yes .
4057	Okay .
4058	I have one more idea .
4059	Just popped up .
4060	Yes ?
4061	No battery use .
4062	it it wo not take a lot of batteries .
4063	So you do not wo not have to change the batteries once a week or once every two weeks .
4064	So
4065	more ideas ?
4066	No okay .
4067	It is only the first ideas .
4068	So
4069	what are we going to do now is Next meeting is in half an h hour .
4070	Okay .
4071	Next meeting , half an hour .
4072	, what you have to do .
4073	Well look on your .
4074	And Next instructions you will get in your email .
4075	So This is the first meeting .
4076	Okay .
4077	 
4078	Okay .
4079	So welcome back .
4080	What do do we have to do ?
4081	So
4082	first .
4083	I want to say I am the secretary , so I make the minutes .
4084	You find them in your in the map in the From the group .
4085	There is the minutes from the first meeting .
4086	You will find the next minutes also there .
4087	Then
4088	I want to hear from you , what you have done .
4089	And after that I have some new product requirements .
4090	So And after that we have to make decisions , what we will do .
4091	And then we are ready .
4092	We have forty minutes for this meeting .
4093	After that we will have lunch .
4094	So first I want to ask the Industrial Designer to tell what he did .
4095	That is my task .
4096	So
4097	Yeah on your computer , or the What is the name ?
4098	What is the name of it ?
4099	It is the technical function or the functional requirements .
4100	Okay .
4101	I have
4102	Where have I put it ?
4103	My Documents or not ?
4104	I have save it on my computer , my presentation .
4105	But where ?
4106	It was about the working of the remote control .
4107	Nope .
4108	Not a of
4109	Wait .
4110	The working design .
4111	But I have saved it .
4112	Working design .
4113	But now I do not know where it is .
4114	Working design .
4115	What is this ?
4116	Product documents .
4117	Yeah .
4118	And I import this until
4119	One more .
4120	On the desktop .
4121	Up .
4122	up .
4123	Up .
4124	Up .
4125	Up .
4126	Yes .
4127	My Documents .
4128	Nope .
4129	What the fuck is this ?
4130	Yeah that is the empty one .
4131	Gone .
4132	Well you Nah .
4133	Nah , nah , nah .
4134	PowerPoint .
4135	Working design .
4136	And
4137	Presentation of working design .
4138	I had one .
4139	Uh huh .
4140	Open it .
4141	Okay here it is .
4142	Save as .
4143	it is
4144	Project .
4145	Desktop .
4146	Project .
4147	Yeah .
4148	Save .
4149	Okay .
4150	Okay .
4151	Very good .
4152	Well .
4153	A little later
4154	but here it is .
4155	Okay .
4156	So
4157	Now have ten minutes to tell it .
4158	So okay .
4159	It is a little difficult what I am going to tell you .
4160	It is about the working of the remote control .
4161	I just had an half an hour j to study it
4162	and I do not get it .
4163	Make it .
4164	Ten minutes to tell it .
4165	Okay .
4166	I think it will be a few minutes and First I will tell you something about the findings , what I discovered about the remote control .
4167	Okay .
4168	The working bout it of it .
4169	then I will have some kind of map , and it is the top of the remote control .
4170	With a little bit of science ,
4171	you
4172	I will show that in in a few minutes .
4173	And then what I will think about it .
4174	First , the findings .
4175	The remote control is a very difficult thing to to explain to just all of you wh who have not seen a remote control inside .
4176	there is a lot of plastic on it , because its not so expensive .
4177	And there are a lot of wires , which connect the components in it , the battery , and there are switches and things like that .
4178	There is a lot of small electronics .
4179	So it wo not be too expensive to build it .
4180	Only twelve Euro fifty
4181	I think we will make it .
4182	Now
4183	And here I have the top of the remote control .
4184	here is some kind of chip .
4185	on top of this , there are the numbers .
4186	you have all on your remote control .
4187	And the teletext button .
4188	And here is the battery .
4189	And when you push the button , it will will be sent to the chip .
4190	And the chip will send it to all kind of sub components .
4191	That is what I said , it is very difficult .
4192	And after that it will be sent to the infrared .
4193	And that will send it to your television .
4194	That is a short h how it works .
4195	I think I can make it difficult , but we all we all do not get it .
4196	My preferences ?
4197	It is it wo not be
4198	We should not make it too big .
4199	also for the cost , we should only put one battery on it .
4200	A long lasting battery .
4201	also for the cost , use only plastic .
4202	Not other materials .
4203	Also because of the cost , not too much buttons on it .
4204	We can also make a button with a menu button .
4205	And then that that you will see it on the TV .
4206	And on the TV you can switch into the menu .
4207	That is I think it is easier .
4208	And the bleep signal , y you told us .
4209	but we can also use it a bleep like something , when the battery is empty , then there is a bleep .
4210	Then you will have to change it in a in a week or something .
4211	And also the bleep , when what I told you about when you lost it ,
4212	and you push a button , and then you hear bleep bleep , and we will find it .
4213	This is just
4214	Yeah .
4215	Oh oh .
4216	Two questions .
4217	Yeah .
4218	The battery .
4219	You say one battery is cheaper .
4220	Why ?
4221	Yeah
4222	but
4223	when you use two , you can use it two times longer .
4224	If we w if we use only just one small pen light , then it will be cheaper than when we use two .
4225	Yeah
4226	but
4227	then we will have to make the remote control long lasting .
4228	Okay so it is the size of the remote control .
4229	Just
4230	Yeah .
4231	Okay and the buttons .
4232	When you use it on the television , you have you need the television , wh which can use it .
4233	Yeah .
4234	But I think this our remote control is for the televisions we we sell in our company ?
4235	Or is it also for other company for other televisions ?
4236	Then this is an option .
4237	Okay .
4238	I think we have to use it also on other televisions though .
4239	So
4240	Yeah
4241	but I do not
4242	I think it
4243	They are two different things though .
4244	Maybe just a menu button to use it on our televisions .
4245	And then we make it easier for our televisions .
4246	And on the other tele televisions , you can also use it ,
4247	but then we wo not use the
4248	Yeah ?
4249	Okay .
4250	We have to choose one .
4251	It has to work on o all televisions .
4252	Then I think the menu button will only work on the newer televisions .
4253	And we will look forward and do not make a remote control which for the older televisions .
4254	Okay .
4255	And I just have one more idea .
4256	maybe it is one of your tasks .
4257	But , to have a trendy remote control , we can also make something like the Nokia mobile phones .
4258	To change covers .
4259	So if you have a trendy half with all red , yellow and something .
4260	And then you can put a red cover on it .
4261	And also different things .
4262	Yeah .
4263	Good idea .
4264	Will this will this add to the cost ?
4265	Yes
4266	but you have to m be able to change it .
4267	Yes .
4268	then it wo not be will have just one cover on the original one .
4269	And then you can buy the covers .
4270	D does it make it more difficult to design ?
4271	Not much .
4272	I think it will be a little more difficult , but not too much .
4273	Kay .
4274	Just like with the Nokia mobile phones .
4275	Yeah but there are much more Nokia telephones than these ones .
4276	Just one .
4277	Yeah but then we will have to to just put five covers on it , and see if it works .
4278	If it wo not works then we will get something else .
4279	Then we wo not g go further with it .
4280	Yeah but are their profits bigger than their cost ?
4281	Yeah but there are also design cost .
4282	a p a a cover made in in China , it it wo not be I guess so expensive I think .
4283	I do not think
4284	When you have a remote control , do you change the cover ?
4285	Would you change the cover ?
4286	No .
4287	Maybe .
4288	I wi I wo not .
4289	But maybe I think trendy people or like children where you can paint on it , and the the children think , oh this is my remote control , I made a picture on it .
4290	N
4291	yeah
4292	but
4293	I think that too less people would change it for good profit .
4294	Yeah .
4295	So Yes it is
4296	but I do not think we have to do it .
4297	Okay .
4298	And the other people ?
4299	What do you think about it ?
4300	Okay .
4301	Yeah it is a good idea .
4302	But
4303	If if it
4304	Yeah , I do not
4305	I am not sure if it will make profit enough to
4306	But it is
4307	yeah
4308	it is original idea .
4309	No .
4310	Okay .
4311	You are the Project Manager .
4312	Okay .
4313	Yes .
4314	That is it .
4315	That is clear .
4316	Okay thank you .
4317	So now the User Interface Designer .
4318	Oh .
4319	That is me .
4320	Come on .
4321	Yeah .
4322	Yes well I shall give a short talk about the the technical function design .
4323	I thought the the the technical function design was to for a remote control to to to have some influence on the TV set .
4324	both audio and vide video in a cordless way .
4325	No cords attached .
4326	And well , it all by pushing a button on the remote .
4327	That was from my own experience and and the previous meeting .
4328	I find some some interesting quotes on the web .
4329	well the same idea here .
4330	message to the television .
4331	And and and and well basic operations like on and off , and switching channels , and and maybe teletext or something like that .
4332	well these are two remotes ,
4333	and that is our our dilemma I think .
4334	We just heard from the Industrial Designer how difficult it is .
4335	But shall we make a basic remote control , just swapping channels and volume and power button and well nothing much more .
4336	Or more functions on the remote .
4337	maybe more devices you can influence .
4338	a radio or a v a video recorder , VCR .
4339	Yeah
4340	well that is our dilemma .
4341	any ideas about that ?
4342	Basic or multifunctional ?
4343	Okay yeah .
4344	We will got back on that later .
4345	Yeah well the
4346	that was just on my mind .
4347	Yes .
4348	So I did not know what what way we would go .
4349	yeah
4350	well that was my functional talk .
4351	Kay .
4352	Kay , thank you .
4353	Then it is your turn , the marketing expert .
4354	Okay .
4355	m
4356	Yeah .
4357	yeah okay .
4358	This bit too far .
4359	So
4360	So I am going to have a presentation about the market , about
4361	yeah
4362	what people think .
4363	we did a usability lab test with a hundred persons .
4364	And we looked at several things .
4365	among them design , d d how d did they like the use of it , what frustrations they had while using remote controls .
4366	well what what will be our market .
4367	And we asked them if we had some new featu features .
4368	If that would be a good idea or not .
4369	Well our findings .
4370	our users , they disliked the look and feel of current remote controls .
4371	they especially found found them very ugly .
4372	And th they also found them hard to to learn how to use it .
4373	well they also zap a lot .
4374	So zapping should be very easy .
4375	And fifty percent of the users only use ten percent of the buttons .
4376	So a lot of unused buttons .
4377	There is more findings .
4378	on the buttons .
4379	Which buttons find users very important and which which not ?
4380	And how much would they use them ?
4381	Well the most used button is the channel selection .
4382	And we asked them how relevant they think the buttons are .
4383	The power , volume and channel selections are very relevant .
4384	teletext is less relevant but also important .
4385	not important they found the audio , that is not the volume but specific the the pitch , or the left or right .
4386	the screen and the brightness .
4387	And channel settings .
4388	th
4389	and they also are not used very often .
4390	Then we have a few graphs about the market .
4391	here we can see what the market share is of several groups .
4392	as you can see , most users are between thirty six and forty five .
4393	the the the younger group between sixteen and twenty five is not very big .
4394	And to come back on the the swapping things , I do not think ,
4395	I
4396	I think the younger will be most interest in it .
4397	But they are not a very big group .
4398	in the we asked them , how would you like a s a new feature .
4399	If you have an LCD on the remote control , what would you think of it .
4400	Now you can clearly see young users say .
4401	I will that would very nice .
4402	And older user think they will be scared of change I think .
4403	And they wo not like it .
4404	And another thing , how would you like to have a speech recognition on it .
4405	Well here we see the same .
4406	Young users think that is an interesting idea .
4407	And old users not .
4408	well we found out that there are two several markets at which we can aim .
4409	the first are the younger , the age between sixteen and forty five .
4410	they are highly interested in the features , as you can see here .
4411	And they are more critical on their money spending .
4412	the second group is the older group .
4413	Aged between forty six and sixty five .
4414	They are less interested in new features .
4415	But they spend their money more easily .
4416	Now if we look back at this graph , we can see that among the first group is about sixty percent .
4417	And the second group about forty percent .
4418	So the the first group is bigger .
4419	Well then I come to my personal preferences .
4420	yeah the first question is also we have to ask is at the which market do we aim at .
4421	of course n saying we aim at the young group does not say that old people wo not buy it .
4422	But less of them will buy it .
4423	well I
4424	Okay .
4425	What I thought , even young people say it is hard to use , remote control .
4426	So if you make a remote control that is very easy to use , that is especially aimed at this group , even the young group will also be more interested .
4427	And we can make special features .
4428	But I think it looks nice in the first time .
4429	But when use it , I do not know what is good thing of speech recognition .
4430	well th that is my second point .
4431	less important functions should be discarded from the remote control .
4432	It is about discussion we had earlier .
4433	You can find most functions on a TV set .
4434	So you do not have to have a lot of audio options , or screen options to change the brightness .
4435	And such things .
4436	well the design is very important .
4437	One thing I did not say I think , is that a lot of users also said then I would buy a good looking remote control if there will be one .
4438	But they found most remote controls very ugly .
4439	So the design of our remote control is very important .
4440	And yeah it should be very zap friendly , as most users use it for that .
4441	That were my findings .
4442	Okay thank you .
4443	Yeah .
4444	I have one question .
4445	If we aim for the younger people , and there will be a lot of features like LCD or the the the speech f recognising , the cost will be a lot of h a lot higher .
4446	Yes .
4447	Yes .
4448	I think we do not have that in our budget .
4449	No .
4450	Do you think ?
4451	Like
4452	No .
4453	No .
4454	And I do not I do not think twenty five Euros for a remote is really cheap or something .
4455	No .
4456	So it is
4457	Yeah , it is hard to get the younger group .
4458	Uh huh .
4459	I think the LCD is cheaper than speech recognition .
4460	So I think that can be an d good option .
4461	LCD .
4462	Just the LCD ?
4463	Yes .
4464	Only the LCD .
4465	So
4466	But we will come back on that .
4467	Okay .
4468	Now
4469	Oh , go on .
4470	What d d d
4471	we go back on the decisions later .
4472	Now we have a few new product requirements .
4473	First , teletext .
4474	We have internet now so we do not need the teletext anymore .
4475	So not necessary .
4476	Next .
4477	Only for the television .
4478	So we do not look at the other things like the radio or something .
4479	Only the television .
4480	We look at the age group of forty plus .
4481	no , younger than forty .
4482	Is a g big group , and like you showed , n not very much people buy our stuff .
4483	Fourth point .
4484	Our corporate colour and slogan must be used .
4485	Very important for the design .
4486	So you can see it on our site .
4487	Next .
4488	no .
4489	We have to make our decisions , what we want to do .
4490	So like you said , we need the .
4491	Maybe it is good to put it in a document .
4492	Now we have to decide what controls do we need .
4493	So maybe you can tell us .
4494	Yeah maybe we can first have a discussion on the the product requirements you just said .
4495	Sorry ?
4496	Yes .
4497	The the requirements you just said ,
4498	maybe we should first have a discussion about that .
4499	Yes , it is okay .
4500	I personally think teletext is a good option .
4501	not everyone who is looking TV can go to internet when they want to see the latest news .
4502	Yeah but we do not use it .
4503	It is a new requirement .
4504	So , it is not my requirement .
4505	Kay , we will just have to do that .
4506	We have to do this .
4507	Okay .
4508	Okay .
4509	No discussion about it .
4510	Okay sorry .
4511	Then
4512	Mine ?
4513	It is the functional requirements .
4514	No .
4515	Okay .
4516	Unfortunately .
4517	So
4518	what controls do we need ?
4519	Who first ?
4520	Okay .
4521	Well a power button ?
4522	the well I think separate channels .
4523	power .
4524	So But then both the the separate channels .
4525	channel .
4526	So so zero to nine or something .
4527	Channel
4528	Zero to nine .
4529	volume .
4530	Volume .
4531	Maybe it is easy to pick .
4532	What was w your one ?
4533	Techno
4534	Okay .
4535	We had w
4536	no no no no .
4537	Where was that example of the
4538	Johan .
4539	Oh mine .
4540	That was the the the the the
4541	technical
4542	Hallo .
4543	Technical .
4544	Okay .
4545	What do we need ?
4546	On off .
4547	Zero to nine .
4548	To change to the next channel , just one button .
4549	To move up , move down .
4550	Yeah that is the channel .
4551	D
4552	Yeah .
4553	Do we make a menu ?
4554	I think it will be q quite easy to use , to have four arrows .
4555	Menu ?
4556	yes the n newer televisions ha do have menus .
4557	M Menu .
4558	I think the only one or two numbers .
4559	yes .
4560	And
4561	Hello ?
4562	That is ch
4563	Yes .
4564	Up down for channel selection , and left right for volume .
4565	And a menu button .
4566	And if you press the menu button you get into the menu , and you can use the same buttons .
4567	But the then to scroll through the menu and to change the options .
4568	On the LCD screen , you mean ?
4569	Think it is better to have it on the remote control , cause it it has to work on all televisions .
4570	well yeah that depends on if you have the menu on the TV .
4571	Or you get the menu on the LCD screen on the remote control .
4572	So
4573	we need
4574	N
4575	Yes .
4576	Yes .
4577	But then we come to the costs .
4578	But if we have this
4579	So now we do not have a lot of buttons .
4580	Kay .
4581	But well if you aim at the younger market , a as they as s as we seen in the usability lab , they will buy a nice looking remote control .
4582	And also to find the easy to use part very important .
4583	So if we have a LCD sh screen , and not too many buttons , I think that will incre even when it is a bit more cost , it will still sell .
4584	Is this enough ?
4585	Mute .
4586	Mute .
4587	Maybe in the menu ?
4588	Mute .
4589	Yeah .
4590	Okay .
4591	Maybe more ?
4592	No .
4593	Well .
4594	Then that is all .
4595	This will be the buttons .
4596	And
4597	I think that is enough for the next phase .
4598	So we can go on to
4599	Yes .
4600	But now we have only the buttons .
4601	And we do not yet have to decide what the remote control would look like ?
4602	Or
4603	Okay .
4604	No that is for the next phase .
4605	Phase two is the conceptual design .
4606	So then we will have the concepts .
4607	Okay .
4608	Okay .
4609	That is for the
4610	So next point .
4611	Now we have lunch break .
4612	After that we have t thirty minutes for work .
4613	And you can find the minutes in the Project Documents folder inclusive the buttons .
4614	No .
4615	Your individual action , you can find them in the email .
4616	So now it is time for lunch .
4617	Okay .
4618	 
4619	Okay .
4620	Well , let is start .
4621	What are we doing ?
4622	Oops .
4623	, pinball .
4624	Okay .
4625	Okay .
4626	Not doing .
4627	Very good .
4628	Oh .
4629	Hey .
4630	Now I have my screen back too .
4631	Okay .
4632	Yeah .
4633	we have presentations .
4634	So first , it is your turn .
4635	Mine .
4636	Oh , great .
4637	Yeah .
4638	Huh .
4639	Is not it amazing .
4640	Yeah .
4641	Very interesting .
4642	Yes , well
4643	let is talk about the interface concept .
4644	Industrial Designer .
4645	Interface concept .
4646	, first I will I will discuss the buttons we just chose , show you some samples , discuss some colours and design maybe , already .
4647	And my personal preferences .
4648	Well we chose the power button to switch the television on and off .
4649	The bu
4650	the mute button to switch the volume on and o on and off .
4651	The channels buttons , one to nine ,
4652	and off
4653	zero to nine , and the button to choose higher channels than nine .
4654	the volume and channel quadrants , left and right , up and down arrows , to do the volume and channel .
4655	And the menu menu button to man manipulate the LCD display .
4656	, I found some interesting samples .
4657	Examples .
4658	, well what is pretty standard is that it is that they are all pretty high
4659	Yeah .
4660	Large .
4661	A lot a lot of buttons buttons .
4662	Yeah .
4663	Large and and and pretty thin and and long .
4664	, power buttons are mostly at the top left or right .
4665	, well we see the the the same arrows .
4666	Like there .
4667	And
4668	Yeah , well arrow b buttons can be blue .
4669	And what is interesting is the the the icons on the buttons .
4670	Some buttons have icons like the play and stop , but we do not use that .
4671	But , these we we have to choose the right icons , or or letters .
4672	this is the V for volume , but they are both a V .
4673	So it is it is not really very clear what is the function of that .
4674	Yeah .
4675	Yeah .
4676	So , that is
4677	, well
4678	Yeah .
4679	Can you go back one page ?
4680	For the menu , what do we use for that ?
4681	We do not have buttons for the menu .
4682	Or we may have to use channel of the volume and channel .
4683	I thought that was our idea .
4684	Okay .
4685	So , how
4686	Like this .
4687	But
4688	You have to put it on the
4689	Yeah .
4690	Or or this .
4691	And that the menu button is okay .
4692	Yeah but , has to be clear that you can use the arrows .
4693	Yeah , okay .
4694	Yes .
4695	, so the The icons on the arrows , as well , you mean .
4696	Yes .
4697	The second one .
4698	Yeah .
4699	, well that is something to think about .
4700	Okay .
4701	, maybe I will have something in my presentation .
4702	And you will see it .
4703	Okay .
4704	Okay .
4705	, well I do not I do not know if we have to discuss this already , or in the next meeting .
4706	But , as we have to to to design the the case and the whole remote control in our our our corporate company colours and the logo , I would recommend a yellow case .
4707	, round edges .
4708	The logo at the bottom .
4709	And , well maybe each each set of buttons has has his own colour .
4710	So , it is good .
4711	, recognisable .
4712	K
4713	so , I think .
4714	Not too much colours .
4715	, no .
4716	Not too much .
4717	But
4718	No , no , no .
4719	No , it is not flower power .
4720	But this has to be has to be trendy
4721	and and
4722	, yeah so good good icons on the buttons , and and big buttons is my personal opinion .
4723	S
4724	okay .
4725	Okay .
4726	That was that .
4727	Thank you .
4728	So , you are next .
4729	I am next , okay .
4730	Yes .
4731	No .
4732	Here we go .
4733	, at first we will I will f say something about what younger people want ,
4734	our group w w we want to sell our remote controls to .
4735	Okay .
4736	And then , I will discuss what my opinion is about the costs , about what battery is in it , what kind of buttons also .
4737	First , the younger people , they want like soft mat materials and primary colours .
4738	Like , totally yellow , totally red .
4739	, so it is visible .
4740	, the shapes are curved and round , like you also said .
4741	Maybe it is nice to get a remote control not like all the other ones , straight and flat and long .
4742	But to give him the shape of your hand , so you it is easier to use or something like that .
4743	But that is just an idea .
4744	And then , I will have to discuss about the costs of all the things for the remote control .
4745	The battery , there are few options .
4746	, I think the best option is to use the basic battery .
4747	So , everybody can buy it at the at the supermarket .
4748	Or use a k kinetic battery like within a watch .
4749	When you shake it a few times , it it is loaded .
4750	, the the form of the remote control , I think it is also nice have it curved .
4751	And maybe like it is hand shaped .
4752	, so you take it here in your hand and here are the buttons .
4753	material , you use plastic .
4754	Hard plastic
4755	because it wo not have to burst like in the in one time .
4756	And also rubber
4757	because the younger people like that , what we see in the research .
4758	the push buttons .
4759	We have one new thing discovered .
4760	It is a scroll push thing like a mouse .
4761	Maybe it is easy to use for the channels .
4762	When you want to go m move up , you just scroll up and click on the button , if you want to see the next , if you want to see that channel .
4763	And also for the mouse , for the volume , it is also easy to use .
4764	Just scroll a bit up , scroll a bit down .
4765	And that is also easy just w when you have a thing like this , and you get it here .
4766	You can do it with your thumb .
4767	And with your l left hand you can push the buttons if you push channel one , you can see channel one .
4768	The electrics with a scroll push button , we must use regular chips .
4769	There are also simple chips .
4770	They are cheaper .
4771	, but then we have just a basic remote control , and I think there are a lot of those things , and people wo not buy it any more .
4772	They have seen enough of it .
4773	And you have also advanced chips .
4774	But that is with the LCD screen .
4775	And the costs will increase a lot more .
4776	And I think our budget is too low to use and an LCD , and the chip who is more expensive .
4777	And maybe it is also then thoughtful if we
4778	u use as different kind of shapes for the for remote control , that we then use the primary colours .
4779	Like , you get a yellow remote control , red one , blue one , et cetera .
4780	You have any more questions about this ?
4781	I think the main thing is we look at the costs .
4782	Yep .
4783	And not too basic , not a basic remote control , who everybody already has .
4784	Yeah .
4785	But , thi i
4786	This is with an LCD ?
4787	No ,
4788	not .
4789	Not with an LCD .
4790	No , is not .
4791	No .
4792	But the LCD is easy when you use the scroll buttons .
4793	Then you can scroll , you see what number , and then you push .
4794	Yeah .
4795	But then , what I say , the costs will get a lot higher .
4796	But then it is not easy to use scroll wheel .
4797	Th then you will see it on the television .
4798	If you do not
4799	, yes .
4800	But then .
4801	Yeah , then you go one down one up .
4802	When you scroll .
4803	Yeah
4804	but l when you see a menu on the television , it is like you see one to twenty
4805	, you go s scroll up , and push number tw twenty .
4806	Yeah
4807	but like we said before , it has to be used on every television .
4808	So you may not be
4809	No .
4810	The television must do that .
4811	So
4812	Yeah
4813	but young people have to have all their room .
4814	Yeah , I think the younger people will have newer televisions , which can provide our remote control .
4815	And mostly they are smaller .
4816	Yes .
4817	So
4818	Most the times that are not advanced televisions .
4819	But that wo not be a problem .
4820	I think .
4821	No ,
4822	but then we will get to the regular remote controls .
4823	And I think , what I said , everybody has them has them already .
4824	And they go to a supermarket and buy them for two Euros .
4825	, and ge and get the most cheapest thing .
4826	And I think we must look further to to devel d develop something news .
4827	Okay .
4828	, can you give an indication in b in the cost difference between the chip with LCD or without ?
4829	Cause it
4830	I think if we have an LCD , it will also sell a lot better .
4831	I got it on my screen and it was higher .
4832	But I do not know how much higher .
4833	That is important .
4834	That is true .
4835	And that might bring back the costs
4836	Huh .
4837	But then we will
4838	I think we must discuss who what will be better .
4839	If we have a better shape of the remote control , or better options on it .
4840	With a scroll menu , a w scroll thing , and a LCD .
4841	And then a flat remote control .
4842	Or , a more hand shaped remote control , with scroll , without LCD .
4843	Yeah .
4844	Maybe you can look how how much it is for the LCD .
4845	I can look on my
4846	Note that the push button requires a simple chip chip .
4847	It is very important .
4848	A scroll wheel requires minimally a regular chip , which is a higher price range .
4849	The display requires a advanced chip , which is which in turn is more expensive than the regular chip .
4850	Yeah , more expensive .
4851	But how much ?
4852	Oh .
4853	Does not say .
4854	Okay .
4855	That is from my manufacturing division .
4856	Okay .
4857	Kay .
4858	Well , thank you .
4859	My turn ?
4860	Yes ?
4861	Changing covers .
4862	Next .
4863	So So Yeah .
4864	So , my presentation is about trend watching .
4865	, I did some trend watching .
4866	It is very important to keep up with latest trends .
4867	Cause if you do not , you wo not sell .
4868	So , well how we did do that ? ,
4869	well we made an investigation of the market , by Trendwatchers .
4870	They watch in cities like Paris and Milan .
4871	Of course , well known for their trend trends .
4872	And well , what did you find ?
4873	, we have two groups , young and trendy , and the old and rich .
4874	Well th and the young and trendy , they they starting to like fruit and vegetables as a theme for n clothes , shoes , and also products .
4875	And , material ?
4876	That should feel have a spongy feeling .
4877	And to get a feeling for what it is , here is an image of it .
4878	Then the old and rich .
4879	They like dark colours , and simple , recognisable shapes .
4880	And , they also like familiar material , especially wood .
4881	Now , another picture .
4882	To get a feeling for this .
4883	Well , then already come to my personal preferences .
4884	We aim at the younger market .
4885	So , we should also be look at their trends .
4886	However , with trends it is always if there is it is now .
4887	It it it might last one year , and next year it be can be totally different .
4888	And I think we want to sell our product for longer than one year .
4889	So , we m must not just only look at what the trend is now ,
4890	as it might be totally different next year .
4891	So , that is one thing to keep in mind .
4892	Yeah .
4893	Any questions ?
4894	Yeah .
4895	Nope .
4896	No .
4897	No .
4898	It is clear .
4899	So now , it is
4900	, let is see .
4901	Now , w we have to decide
4902	Well , we have to decide on the concept .
4903	So , we have to look at Is next .
4904	Components and user interface concept .
4905	So
4906	Now , we have to make some concept .
4907	Maybe one of you can paint it on the board .
4908	First , user interface .
4909	, uh uh .
4910	How w how we how we make it ?
4911	Should not we first discuss about like what w we all
4912	Yeah , but if I paint with
4913	More like something
4914	M like
4915	Yeah I ca not dr I ca not draw it .
4916	Yes , a concept on Just
4917	Yeah ,
4918	but maybe we can paint it .
4919	, what do we want ?
4920	I will paint .
4921	Okay .
4922	Well
4923	Something like this ?
4924	Or
4925	Shapes or What do we need ?
4926	Yes , okay .
4927	, yes .
4928	Can make several concepts .
4929	What ?
4930	We have this , and we had the idea of an a more like sh in the shape of your hand .
4931	Okay .
4932	Yeah I
4933	I
4934	I yes .
4935	I have to .
4936	And you have to .
4937	Yeah .
4938	I am not a designer .
4939	It is more three D .
4940	Like , when you have a part here .
4941	This is the remote control .
4942	And then you have something like th this under it .
4943	So , it is easier to get it like this .
4944	Yeah .
4945	Yeah .
4946	It is like a gun .
4947	A g
4948	So , it has to be soft ?
4949	Okay .
4950	And it has to be soft , yeah .
4951	So , you can squeeze in it and
4952	Sorry ?
4953	Buttons on top of it .
4954	And , the buttons ?
4955	Buttons .
4956	And here .
4957	The scrolling .
4958	You can do it with your thumb .
4959	But but i that is the only scroll button on it then ?
4960	Yeah , okay .
4961	But now we use one scroll button and the other one is here .
4962	No , it wo not .
4963	One till zero till nine .
4964	But , well there one for the sound and one for the channels .
4965	But but how
4966	Yeah .
4967	Yeah .
4968	And the b
4969	Yeah ?
4970	Or two buttons .
4971	How
4972	Okay .
4973	And i if we go to
4974	But if we have a me
4975	Yeah .
4976	, two scroll wheels .
4977	If Kay c If we do
4978	If we use one , then we will have just a switch on it , and you will just switch it , and now it is the sound to switch back with the menu button .
4979	That is th that is more difficult .
4980	It is better in
4981	But if we do not have a LCD we do not have a menu .
4982	If we have a menu , how do we choose other options ?
4983	Yeah .
4984	And then you also can scroll scroll in it .
4985	Just not like all the other ones , with this thing , and here an arrow , here an arrow , here an arrow , here an arrow .
4986	Because , from h hundred remote controls , ninety nine have it .
4987	Yeah .
4988	, then we have it on the TV , the menu .
4989	Uh uh .
4990	Yeah , but again maybe th
4991	How do we know the TV can handle it ?
4992	You do not know .
4993	So , there is no menu .
4994	I do not know .
4995	It is like some sort of teletext option , but we do not have teletext .
4996	No .
4997	So you ca not use it .
4998	And if we put an LCD thing on it , then the costs will be much higher .
4999	Okay ,
5000	we make two concepts .
5001	One with LCD .
5002	One without LCD .
5003	Kay .
5004	But you all like this kind of thing .
5005	With the scroll button .
5006	Good concept .
5007	But
5008	That is one .
5009	And and this one has to be soft .
5010	Uh uh .
5011	And this has to be harder ,
5012	because when it falls , it mu mu must not burst .
5013	Or some kind of rubber around it .
5014	It is one .
5015	Two .
5016	Number two .
5017	And you can and you can make the the power button as a trigger .
5018	Like Just to Oh , like a
5019	Yeah .
5020	Yeah .
5021	Yeah .
5022	that is nice .
5023	Here .
5024	Trigger .
5025	No .
5026	But when you handle it , you put it on and off .
5027	It is not good to use .
5028	Yeah , but I will zap .
5029	Fuck .
5030	Out .
5031	No , it is not good .
5032	Yeah .
5033	Now , second concept .
5034	One with LCD , one without LCD .
5035	Then
5036	Paint it .
5037	Paint it ?
5038	With the scroll thing on , like this ?
5039	So ?
5040	Draw it .
5041	One with two scroll buttons and one with without .
5042	Yeah .
5043	, one with a with a menu , and one without a menu .
5044	And the one with with a menu has an LCD .
5045	Unbelievable .
5046	Do I have to do everything .
5047	Blank .
5048	You have
5049	Not so difficult .
5050	But if you put push the the menu button
5051	Yeah , wh what
5052	Yes , but you do not know which of the scroll buttons you have to choose .
5053	Yeah .
5054	, that is the menu .
5055	There for the LCD screen .
5056	You have to
5057	For the menu .
5058	Yeah .
5059	One that way .
5060	And one that way .
5061	So
5062	Then it depends on the cost .
5063	S On and off .
5064	But is it easy to use ?
5065	When you have it on your left side ,
5066	and
5067	Separate , more separate , h yeah .
5068	When it is not too big .
5069	Just like a a phone .
5070	M
5071	yeah , maybe it is better if the scroll wheels are
5072	more separate , yeah .
5073	Yes , okay .
5074	Like , you have the menu button in between
5075	Yeah .
5076	Yeah .
5077	On the left a scroll button , and on the right a scroll button .
5078	But would it be easy to use then ?
5079	If it is like you have a big
5080	I also think this concept is not what the young people were looking for .
5081	Very good .
5082	Is it better ?
5083	When you the menu , you have to go there there there there .
5084	They were like round curves ,
5085	different
5086	Okay , okay , okay .
5087	Yeah , okay .
5088	That is that is the outside .
5089	But now the
5090	First the buttons .
5091	Think we have we have now two buttons missing .
5092	The
5093	The mute button .
5094	Sorry ?
5095	Mute .
5096	We have two buttons missing .
5097	The mute button .
5098	And , the to to have to numbers
5099	Okay .
5100	And the other .
5101	Yeah .
5102	Not so difficult .
5103	But ,
5104	Okay .
5105	Personally , I think two scroll buttons are not easy to handle .
5106	But how do you want to solve it ?
5107	Yeah but on the menu that is not easy .
5108	With the switch button .
5109	Then you go down , you switch , you go into the right , you switch ,
5110	you go down .
5111	No
5112	like
5113	Oh , you mean like that .
5114	Yeah .
5115	, then you can also have like th
5116	Yeah , and joystick , I think .
5117	A joystick .
5118	Yeah .
5119	But is it
5120	Does that break , a joystick ?
5121	Or a small one just like in a laptop .
5122	Yeah like in a laptop , s s some sort of thing .
5123	A little bit bigger ,
5124	with easier thi
5125	I do not know .
5126	Mean , it is better .
5127	But how expensive it is ?
5128	Oh .
5129	Why do I pay you for ?
5130	, well
5131	Better ideas .
5132	Or no scroll things .
5133	Just a shape .
5134	And
5135	No , no .
5136	For the young peoples I think scroll button is good .
5137	It wo not work .
5138	Yeah .
5139	Uh huh .
5140	So
5141	Think we have to keep them .
5142	Or a remote control more like joystick .
5143	Yeah , but is it
5144	That is not expensive than Joystick is better .
5145	A small one .
5146	A small one like this , like a Nintendo k
5147	Playstation thing .
5148	No
5149	just like in a a laptop .
5150	Small , round .
5151	Then it is not so big .
5152	No , no , no .
5153	I mean the the shape of the remote control .
5154	Oh the sh
5155	Yeah ,
5156	but then you can
5157	Just like a Playstation thing .
5158	Yeah .
5159	So
5160	Maybe , if it is possible , it is not too expensive , I think a joystick is better .
5161	A small one .
5162	So , please look at it .
5163	No , that is okay ,
5164	I got
5165	they are not in details .
5166	And on the LCD , how much it costs ? , it costs extra ?
5167	Yeah .
5168	It is more expensive or less expensive , huh ?
5169	Then I have to come with it .
5170	Yeah we I think you get it .
5171	So , after this meeting you have half an hour to fix it .
5172	Yes .
5173	I got my personal costs .
5174	I I do not I do not know the costs .
5175	Your problem .
5176	Not mine .
5177	Then I will make something up .
5178	Okay .
5179	So , do we have other concepts ?
5180	Then for the components , we use a normal battery .
5181	, yeah .
5182	Then it is Ch cheapest way , I think .
5183	Yeah , or the or the kinetic with normal battery .
5184	No , no kinetic .
5185	Yeah , I think it is , yeah ,
5186	more expensive .
5187	Kinetic is ch makes it more expensive .
5188	Yeah .
5189	So we use a normal battery .
5190	Yeah .
5191	Okay .
5192	Yes .
5193	Chip .
5194	Depends on the LCD .
5195	Depends on the scroll .
5196	Scroll .
5197	If we use a scroll , then we have the regular chip .
5198	If we do not use a scroll , then we can use the simple chip .
5199	And that is
5200	the most expensive .
5201	Yeah .
5202	And , we If you use the LCD , we have to
5203	Yes , okay .
5204	Yeah .
5205	So , depends on the LCD and the scroll .
5206	If we
5207	Yeah .
5208	Okay .
5209	If we
5210	No okay scroll wheel .
5211	So , I have this .
5212	So , it will be the advanced chip , or the regu or the regular chip .
5213	Okay .
5214	So , the shapes of the design depends on the LCD
5215	and
5216	But , it has to be small .
5217	I think .
5218	Or shall we just put it on the pistol thing ?
5219	And then just put also on LCD on it ?
5220	Just use your thumb .
5221	If you have pistol , it LCD is not easy .
5222	Y y
5223	Yeah
5224	but
5225	If you use a phone .
5226	If you
5227	Yeah .
5228	I use my thumb .
5229	k
5230	Yeah ,
5231	but but then you have it .
5232	Like , th if you have pistol , you have it so .
5233	Yeah .
5234	And the screen is
5235	Well , then you have to keep it this way to look at the screen .
5236	If you have a joystick on
5237	No ,
5238	if you have like an a ni a Playstation game controller .
5239	Yeah .
5240	And you move up , f forward , down , left .
5241	Then you have just , yeah , a little bit curved .
5242	It is not just straight .
5243	No .
5244	No , no .
5245	That is how we use it .
5246	, yeah , but
5247	Yeah .
5248	That is why they make joysticks like that , I think .
5249	Yeah , but then you look forward .
5250	And then you can y
5251	N
5252	well , if you have to look at it .
5253	Yeah ?
5254	Kay .
5255	If you
5256	If we have then something standing here , with the LCD .
5257	Here is our designer .
5258	Yeah .
5259	Then it goes like this .
5260	Yeah , why not .
5261	If th n well
5262	Yes , of course .
5263	It is for the younger people .
5264	It is something new .
5265	It is
5266	Or you can turn it inside .
5267	That is good good .
5268	But the ,
5269	it may not break .
5270	Now we put rubber around it .
5271	Okay .
5272	If that is possible .
5273	, Yeah .
5274	Hard plastic , the shape , and around it hard around it rubber .
5275	And the the hand shape is also rubber .
5276	Okay .
5277	I ca not see the .
5278	But , the easy of
5279	, th the ease of use was not the most important aspect of it .
5280	But that is
5281	No , that is true .
5282	Huh .
5283	, for us it is about to sell it .
5284	One .
5285	Yeah of course .
5286	This is something new .
5287	Okay .
5288	Then this is the design .
5289	And the buttons are on the next page .
5290	So , depends on the cost .
5291	So ,
5292	we have one minute .
5293	Costs are okay .
5294	I think .
5295	No .
5296	No .
5297	You have more .
5298	More .
5299	Seven .
5300	You have still ten .
5301	Next meeting .
5302	Thirty minutes .
5303	So hurry up .
5304	Oh , that is us together .
5305	You two stay here .
5306	Paint it .
5307	Okay .
5308	Now you have to .
5309	So
5310	I think it is clear .
5311	Check your mail .
5312	So
5313	It has to be ready in the next meeting .
5314	Yeah .
5315	Yes .
5316	So
5317	Next meeting is called the detailed design .
5318	What ?
5319	Okay .
5320	So
5321	Everyth everything has to be ready .
5322	Okay .
5323	Kay .
5324	 
5325	Okay .
5326	So , now , last time .
5327	Can you push the button ?
5328	One time please .
5329	So
5330	I am still the secretary .
5331	Now , I ask you to presentate the prototype .
5332	One of your you two .
5333	I do not care .
5334	Oh this , you mean ?
5335	Yes , well
5336	this is it .
5337	Huh ?
5338	Big .
5339	Yes .
5340	The prototype .
5341	This is it .
5342	Well , thank you .
5343	, now
5344	Yes .
5345	It is it is it is yellow .
5346	And , this is rubber .
5347	And and and this too .
5348	The
5349	the sides .
5350	And the rest is hard plastic .
5351	And We we had some
5352	We had a new idea that that this can can be turned inside .
5353	And then it covers the these buttons until here or something .
5354	Okay .
5355	Yes .
5356	And then you can still use the the power button and the mute and the the joystick .
5357	So , you can still operate all the things .
5358	Because you do not always use the menu .
5359	And then it can break .
5360	Okay .
5361	And the buttons ?
5362	And the joystick is for the volume and the channels .
5363	, well
5364	Big buttons .
5365	And everything is blue , except the power button .
5366	And the mute .
5367	Of
5368	yeah , and the mute and the the other button .
5369	Yeah .
5370	Channel higher channel button .
5371	Yeah .
5372	, yes .
5373	Yes .
5374	Yes ,
5375	that is
5376	Very obvious .
5377	Up is channel up .
5378	Down is channel down .
5379	To the right is volume up .
5380	To the left is volume down .
5381	Yeah .
5382	Okay , so if joystick and LCD .
5383	What is the RR
5384	d
5385	Okay .
5386	The RR ?
5387	I will get it .
5388	RR is the l the the the the company logo .
5389	Very good .
5390	So , we have
5391	So , what they say on the side is put fashion there .
5392	That is on the rub rubber part .
5393	, yes .
5394	Yes .
5395	That is about here .
5396	Yes .
5397	It is good .
5398	Oh .
5399	So , that is it .
5400	Yeah ?
5401	Alright .
5402	That is prototype .
5403	Now , the finance .
5404	We do not know if it is th it if it is okay .
5405	So , I am going to look .
5406	Do we
5407	Do we change the Do we change the the order ?
5408	Or are we going to ev evaluate it first ?
5409	Okay .
5410	We have
5411	Sorry ?
5412	Finance is
5413	Yeah
5414	it is
5415	No ,
5416	first
5417	Yes .
5418	We have to evaluate the product yet .
5419	Sorry .
5420	That is
5421	That can be none .
5422	, we going to do the evaluation now , together .
5423	But I have a introduction how it works .
5424	So , it will come up .
5425	Uh oh .
5426	Okay .
5427	, yeah .
5428	Well , we ,
5429	I have thinked a few evaluation criterias , based on our marketing strategy , on the latest trends , on user preferences .
5430	, we have a seven point scale from true , as well .
5431	To false , seven ?
5432	And on base of each c criteria , we need to give a rating .
5433	We can
5434	Well , it look like this .
5435	But we going to do it here , they said .
5436	So , you hope found out how to do it with a Word document .
5437	Yeah .
5438	Okay , yeah .
5439	Yeah .
5440	, well we have the Word document
5441	You
5442	So we open up that blank here .
5443	Criteria .
5444	Think I can
5445	, what this just an example .
5446	So , this not very important .
5447	But , if I can get a number in here .
5448	No , it is okay .
5449	Well , we ca not do that .
5450	Oh , it is okay .
5451	, so you have to think of it as the remote control is techno technologically innovative .
5452	, and then we have to agree on the rating together .
5453	And in the end , we will c count an average of all rating .
5454	The first on each item .
5455	What do you think ?
5456	Yeah .
5457	Yeah , I think it is , well technologically using , it is not it does not contain many new features .
5458	Only the LCD .
5459	So , it
5460	, I think I will give it a yeah
5461	, yeah ,
5462	yeah , a four .
5463	I think the scroll button is something also new .
5464	What not anoth ,
5465	not a lot of a lot of remote controls have .
5466	I think technologically I will give it an seven .
5467	Si six six .
5468	Sorry , six .
5469	So now i I think you see it its statement .
5470	And you true or false .
5471	Oh , true or false .
5472	Oh , I will I will give it a t a two .
5473	And true is one .
5474	So , yeah .
5475	Yeah .
5476	Two .
5477	Sorry .
5478	You ?
5479	Me too .
5480	Three .
5481	So it is a three .
5482	Kay .
5483	, well
5484	It is a one .
5485	The first item .
5486	So , okay the second item .
5487	, this product is for all sorts of customers .
5488	, four .
5489	Well , it is a statement which I disagree with , because we really aim at at young market
5490	and I think the way it looked c totally in yellow , it is not really aimed for all customers .
5491	It does not look like that .
5492	So it is a
5493	Yes , it is for the younger g group .
5494	That is a six .
5495	Five .
5496	Yeah , but it is it is
5497	Yeah .
5498	So it is half half of the people .
5499	So I think it is four .
5500	I mean it still has l large buttons and not m many buttons .
5501	So I mean , the colours are for young people ,
5502	but older
5503	Yeah .
5504	No .
5505	Yes .
5506	So , I think it is four .
5507	Maybe version three point O has other colours .
5508	Yeah .
5509	Maybe .
5510	Okay .
5511	Give it a four .
5512	Four .
5513	Four .
5514	Yep .
5515	, okay .
5516	We put the fashion in electronics .
5517	That is the motto of our company .
5518	Yeah , well do we do this with this product ?
5519	I
5520	Yeah .
5521	I think if we do this , as it is c it is really orientates on the design .
5522	, so I would give it a two .
5523	Me too a two , because only the battery is not techin technologically high standard .
5524	But the rest of it is .
5525	So , I think a two .
5526	Yes .
5527	Two .
5528	Two .
5529	, I say a five .
5530	It is not fashion , it is new .
5531	It must be a fashion .
5532	But it is not .
5533	It
5534	it will be fashion .
5535	Yes .
5536	It w If it is not a fashion we can put it in it .
5537	So , it must be a fashion .
5538	I think it is a five .
5539	Okay .
5540	Then make it th three .
5541	Okay .
5542	Yes , I will think of that too .
5543	No .
5544	Kay .
5545	Oh .
5546	Three is okay .
5547	Yeah , agree ?
5548	A three .
5549	I use my feet though .
5550	Oh , we will wait outside .
5551	Okay .
5552	Yeah okay .
5553	The next element is the product looks good .
5554	Well personally , I do not prefer a remote control that is fully in yellow .
5555	So , I would give this a five .
5556	I give it a one .
5557	Yes , a one .
5558	I like it .
5559	Well , I say three .
5560	So , counting then is two and a half .
5561	We have to do our
5562	Two or three ?
5563	Two .
5564	Say two .
5565	Okay , two .
5566	Two .
5567	Okay .
5568	So , well we going to do the next part .
5569	, yep .
5570	, the next statement .
5571	It has not too much buttons .
5572	, yeah ,
5573	I I have said is not because a low number is better .
5574	And in the end we calculate an average .
5575	So , that is why it is a negative in it .
5576	, well this one of our aims not have too much buttons .
5577	So , did we do that ?
5578	Well , if we go to this fashion , I We still have caused a lot of buttons for the numbers .
5579	But you can you can go for that .
5580	And that way , you do not have a lot of buttons over .
5581	So , I would give this a two .
5582	One .
5583	You ?
5584	Me too .
5585	One .
5586	One .
5587	One .
5588	, but where where is the ?
5589	So
5590	Yeah , did we implement the sound ?
5591	Yeah .
5592	Next , six .
5593	It does not get lost easily .
5594	Just a small thing .
5595	Yes .
5596	No , we did not .
5597	Yeah , but
5598	Yeah .
5599	So , but can it get lost if it is such a thing ?
5600	I do not think so .
5601	Yellow .
5602	Looks like a pistol .
5603	Yes .
5604	Not a not a normal shapes .
5605	It wo not get between the pillows on the couch .
5606	So
5607	No .
5608	It wo not get lost .
5609	So
5610	A one ?
5611	Okay , a one .
5612	Yeah , o one .
5613	It wo not .
5614	Yeah .
5615	One .
5616	Next .
5617	Okay , well we aimed for the younger market .
5618	yeah , did we achieve that .
5619	I think with the way it looks and it is designed , I will give it a two .
5620	Yeah me
5621	That was our target .
5622	Yeah .
5623	Me too .
5624	Two .
5625	Two .
5626	Yeah .
5627	Yeah ?
5628	Yeah .
5629	Yep .
5630	Right .
5631	There is a fancy look and feel .
5632	, yes .
5633	That that was , yeah , one of the most important things that Trendwatch said .
5634	I did not say it in my presentation .
5635	But ,
5636	well does it have that ?
5637	I would say yes .
5638	So
5639	Well , let is also give this a two .
5640	T
5641	Yeah .
5642	I gave this a one because of the rubber .
5643	It feels soft .
5644	, it looks like a l b , a bit like a joystick .
5645	It is Yeah .
5646	Yeah , f very fancy trendy .
5647	Okay .
5648	Yes , a one .
5649	I say a two .
5650	It is a a bit personal .
5651	If it is fancy .
5652	So I think s two is better .
5653	Yeah , okay .
5654	Okay .
5655	Two is okay .
5656	Two .
5657	And , then the last one I could think of ,
5658	it goes with the latest trends .
5659	No , it is new .
5660	Innovation .
5661	If we looked at the latest trends for the younger people , and they ate fruit and vegetables ,
5662	well it has a a nice colour , well compared to food
5663	but we did not
5664	We did not paint any fruit and vegetable on it for something like that .
5665	Oh .
5666	So , I would did not give this a one or two .
5667	I
5668	We will go for a three .
5669	I go for two because the the shapes are still round .
5670	, the latest trends are soft things , you know , like I said in my presentation .
5671	Yes .
5672	But the the colours are basic , like yellow , red , blue .
5673	Something what also younger people want .
5674	It is also a trend , so I will give it a two .
5675	Okay .
5676	, three .
5677	Me too .
5678	Three .
5679	A three .
5680	Yeah .
5681	Okay .
5682	So , come back to the presentation now .
5683	So , we find yourself there ,
5684	and now we have to calculate an average rating .
5685	So , we will do that .
5686	Effort is three , ten and twelve .
5687	Yes .
5688	Thirty , forty , fifty , .
5689	Twenty one .
5690	So , it is two and three nine two and one third .
5691	By nine .
5692	Two .
5693	Yeah .
5694	, okay .
5695	Two .
5696	Yep .
5697	Come on .
5698	, nah .
5699	Okay .
5700	So , that is a pretty low rating , I think .
5701	Yes .
5702	So , it is good .
5703	So , according to our own evaluation we did a good job .
5704	Okay .
5705	Thank you .
5706	Yeah , I think .
5707	Oh .
5708	Nah .
5709	How am I doing ?
5710	Yes .
5711	And I closed your slide show .
5712	Okay .
5713	Back to my
5714	Yep .
5715	Which one was the last for you ?
5716	, dreaming .
5717	Next please .
5718	Next .
5719	So , now we have a product .
5720	Finance .
5721	Very happy .
5722	But , is it cheap enough ?
5723	, so if
5724	I will have a look .
5725	We have a battery .
5726	One battery .
5727	Cheapest there is .
5728	Okay , one battery .
5729	Electronics .
5730	Advanced chip .
5731	Expensive .
5732	Yeah
5733	it is the most advanced .
5734	Chip on print .
5735	We have that one .
5736	Well , it is the most advanced .
5737	We have the simple , regular and advanced .
5738	Advanced .
5739	We have the adva advanced .
5740	Kay , so uncurved or flat .
5741	Nope .
5742	Single curved or double curved ?
5743	We have double curved .
5744	So
5745	Then we have plastic , wood , rubber .
5746	we have half rubber , half plastic .
5747	, yes .
5748	No titanium .
5749	Special colour .
5750	Yes , yellow .
5751	Yeah .
5752	, yellow .
5753	, yeah .
5754	Interface , push button .
5755	Scroll wheel , integrated scroll wheel push push button , or LCD display .
5756	So , we have the LCD
5757	We have two scroll wheels ?
5758	Or one ?
5759	And it is not really a s
5760	Yeah , it is this one .
5761	One .
5762	One .
5763	Joystick thing .
5764	Now , button supplement .
5765	Special colour .
5766	We already
5767	, that is the from the for the buttons .
5768	The buttons are regular colour .
5769	, yeah .
5770	So , then then then then then then then Then
5771	, no .
5772	We are not going to make it .
5773	It is too expensive .
5774	Yeah .
5775	Wh
5776	What what are the costs ?
5777	Fifteen .
5778	So , we have to change something .
5779	Fifteen Euros .
5780	Yeah , well when we lose one scroll wheel , it is okay .
5781	Cause we ca not lose the battery .
5782	We ca not lose the advanced chip .
5783	We ca not lose the double curve .
5784	We have rubber , special colour .
5785	We would have n
5786	For a remote control .
5787	A special colour .
5788	, I do not think it is a very special colour .
5789	Oh , no , we
5790	No , it is
5791	Sorry ?
5792	, then we lose two Euros .
5793	Yellow ?
5794	, is it a special colour ?
5795	What ?
5796	Yeah .
5797	I have
5798	For a remote control , I think it is .
5799	If we would have normal buttons instead of the joystick .
5800	For up down left right .
5801	Then we have thirteen Euros .
5802	Half a Euro too much .
5803	Exactly the special colours .
5804	And what if we use only one sort of just only plastic or only rubber ?
5805	One Euro discount .
5806	So
5807	That is one Euro .
5808	So , I do not think that is good .
5809	I think we have to keep the LCD .
5810	If
5811	Yes .
5812	If we change the joyst the joystick thing into a button up , button down , button right , button left .
5813	Then it is only thirteen Euros .
5814	And then we will lose fifty cent in what ?
5815	uh uh .
5816	So yeah .
5817	Yeah .
5818	Then you have
5819	Or you have to cut this off .
5820	Then it is not good anymore .
5821	No .
5822	So , wait .
5823	Okay .
5824	I will have a look .
5825	We
5826	Yellow rubber .
5827	And if you say it is just a r normal colour it is a normal colour ,
5828	wh
5829	No one will see it .
5830	Yeah , normal .
5831	Normal colour , and the the joystick away , and put the button up , button down , right , left .
5832	One minute , please .
5833	And it is twelve Euros , I think .
5834	Is it maximum .
5835	Yeah , it is normal colour .
5836	But if you lose the joystick , it is still an advanced chip ?
5837	Or it is then a regular ?
5838	So , the advanced is for the LCD and the regular for the joystick .
5839	No .
5840	, no , no , no .
5841	Oh , wait wait wait .
5842	The advanced chip was for the LCD
5843	was not it ?
5844	If If we have the n no buttons
5845	If we have we have not a joystick but buttons , we would have , we have thirteen Euros ?
5846	And then we move the the colour .
5847	Yeah .
5848	Oh yeah .
5849	Oh yeah .
5850	Yeah .
5851	Yeah ,
5852	yeah .
5853	And what if we lose the LCD ?
5854	Yeah , regular chip .
5855	If we lose the LCD , then we have an regular chip and no LCD .
5856	But
5857	Is it a good design ?
5858	, yes .
5859	, yeah .
5860	Then you will have to m see the menu on the television .
5861	And you do not have the LCD .
5862	So , the TVs has to have to be up to date .
5863	Yeah .
5864	What will that be ?
5865	Yeah .
5866	Yeah .
5867	Then it is okay .
5868	Huh .
5869	No knew that .
5870	Okay , so no joystick .
5871	Oh no ,
5872	but we then we get push buttons from half a Euro .
5873	Yeah ,
5874	then it is twelve Euro fifty , then it is okay .
5875	, yes , yes , yes , yes .
5876	No joystick .
5877	Push buttons .
5878	No special colour .
5879	Twelve and a half Euros .
5880	Then it is okay .
5881	So , we have to change that a little bit .
5882	And you cannot use the red and green button .
5883	Because if you give them a s colour , you have to pay point two Euros .
5884	Okay .
5885	All the same
5886	, yeah .
5887	So , all the buttons has to have to be the same colour .
5888	Yes .
5889	But then the print on it will g change it .
5890	Make it for everybody to see what button it is .
5891	l How you call it ?
5892	Recognisable
5893	, yeah .
5894	Recognisable .
5895	Like what
5896	Yeah .
5897	Yes .
5898	, yeah .
5899	So So Well
5900	Now we have to change that ,
5901	but that is okay .
5902	Yeah ?
5903	Okay .
5904	Okay .
5905	Rubber .
5906	What is the normal colour ?
5907	So And
5908	Where is ?
5909	Yeah .
5910	Oh , well that is clear .
5911	So , now it is
5912	Yeah .
5913	And the joystick away .
5914	And its buttons .
5915	It is .
5916	But then it will be just that ones .
5917	Yeah .
5918	Now it is
5919	Very good .
5920	still , he waited at the
5921	No .
5922	Now , project eva evaluation .
5923	Well
5924	What do you think of it ?
5925	About the project .
5926	About the
5927	process .
5928	Project .
5929	Went good .
5930	I think the creativity was good enough .
5931	We have a gun instead of a remote control .
5932	leadership .
5933	Yeah , you were the project project manager , and had the final vote .
5934	So yeah that was clear .
5935	Team work okay .
5936	Everybody has something to say about it .
5937	And no ,
5938	o only the the drawing was very difficult .
5939	But , nah .
5940	New ideas found .
5941	Nope .
5942	Okay .
5943	And you .
5944	Yeah , well the same .
5945	I I espe
5946	I especially liked the the means , the the SMARTboard
5947	and
5948	Yeah , it
5949	It brings up new ideas when you work with with it .
5950	Okay .
5951	Yeah .
5952	Yeah , I think you have to compare it to if you would have a normal normal project without laptops and without these devices .
5953	I think
5954	Well , the laptops if you have them out front of you , you sometimes looking at that instead of the presentation .
5955	, well the draw board , well you can draw things .
5956	But it not really going very convenient .
5957	, maybe it will be easier if you have a smaller monitor and you would also see there .
5958	And with a normal mouse .
5959	, and the project .
5960	Yeah , I agree on what was said mainly .
5961	, yeah
5962	but you always have that some people are talking more than others .
5963	And maybe is then the task of the the project manager to also ask more to the people less talking .
5964	To tell their opinion .
5965	Okay .
5966	Well , what do I have to say .
5967	I think it was good .
5968	Not too many discussions .
5969	No .
5970	So , it is good for the speed .
5971	No .
5972	Yep .
5973	So , I think we are ready .
5974	Yeah .
5975	Good price .
5976	Evaluation ready .

6018	It is important that the laptops are exactly on the square , for the cameras .
6019	Okay .
6020	Okay .
6021	we are here to develop a new product .
6022	I am sure you have had a mail from our account manager about it .
6023	and
6024	this is the first meeting to to generate some some ideas about it .
6025	you are here in a specific role .
6026	Ruud is here as the Marketing Expert , Roo is here as the User Interface Designer and Sebastian is here in the role of Industrial Designer .
6027	Is that correct ?
6028	Okay .
6029	That is correct .
6030	we are going to do a little tool training for the tools we are going to use during the meetings we are going to have here .
6031	then I will tell you a little bit about my idea of the project plan ,
6032	and we will have a discussion .
6033	this meeting should take no more than twenty five minutes , so we should keep that in mind .
6034	Alright .
6035	Okay .
6036	is there any room for a little presentation ?
6037	maybe during the discussion section ?
6038	Okay .
6039	There is ?
6040	Yeah , there is .
6041	No problem .
6042	okay ,
6043	this new product we are are
6044	g are going to develop , it is a remote control , a television remote control .
6045	and first of all it should be original , it should be trendy and user friendly .
6046	Those are kind of easy goals ,
6047	and I am sure we can find more goals for the for the product we are going to develop .
6048	we will discuss later on more ideas about how the remote should look and how it sh it should function and all those kind of things .
6049	Okay .
6050	The market , we should have a look at the market .
6051	we are going to use a a pred a project method during this development , which consists of three different design stages .
6052	the functional design , the conceptual design and the detailed design , all of these stages mean that we do some individual work , prepare , and then meet to discuss our the
6053	the the progressions , yes .
6054	Progressions .
6055	the first stage , the functional design we are going to search for the user requirements , and we will make a specific specification of that .
6056	the second is the technical functional design , what effect should the remote have ?
6057	Well in this case control t the the television I think .
6058	It is for the vision .
6059	Yeah .
6060	and the last one is the working design .
6061	How exactly does it work in the technical sense .
6062	the other design stages , we will discuss that later .
6063	So we will kop it keep it with the functional design .
6064	Okay , before we think about remote control we will work with some of the tools we have here .
6065	as you see now I can give a presentation .
6066	it is also possible to use this one as well .
6067	You can display pr two presentations if you want to .
6068	to presentate , to show us a file you will need to place it in your project documents folder , which is on your desktop , at least it should be .
6069	then we have this electronic white board system .
6070	yeah , I will show that now .
6071	you can draw on the board using this pen .
6072	There are little
6073	sensors ,
6074	so do not grab it here , but a lit more a little bit more to the to the end .
6075	Sensors .
6076	well , it
6077	it is on the eraser now , so we click the pen button .
6078	Okay , so not too fast writing .
6079	you can insert a new slide or or white board file by either using the insert function or by clicking the next button or the blank button .
6080	It is quite the same .
6081	all our whi SMARTboard notes should be kept in the same file .
6082	So do not m make a new file .
6083	Just use this one during the day .
6084	you can use the eraser to make something go away .
6085	But we all use the same white board file
6086	So we can work together on it while we are or should we only use it in the in the meetings ?
6087	Yeah , okay .
6088	Yes .
6089	Yeah .
6090	Yeah , in the meetings , only in the meetings .
6091	It is really like like a regu regular whiteboard .
6092	Yeah , alright .
6093	Yep .
6094	you can choose the format ,
6095	sorry .
6096	Let me see .
6097	Well
6098	I guess it is maybe because I am not s pen selected .
6099	Yep .
6100	Current colour , you can choose another colour .
6101	And for example black , and you c I can choose the line width .
6102	so now I d have a different line width and colour .
6103	Okay .
6104	Quite easy ,
6105	if you do have any questions , just c ask me .
6106	to
6107	oh well , I am
6108	I wrote down the documents should be in the project documents folder if you want to discuss it with us .
6109	as a little training I will ask Ruud first to draw your own animal on a new slide with a different colour and a different line width than the one now selected .
6110	Okay .
6111	green .
6112	An animal .
6113	Okay .
6114	a wee rabbit .
6115	It is a bunny .
6116	A rabbit .
6117	Alright .
6118	Okay , well great .
6119	Roo , could you do the same please ?
6120	But a different animal with a different colour and a different line width .
6121	But of course , Flores .
6122	Blank .
6123	Sebastian is thinking about the animal .
6124	I am just guessing what should be my favourite animal .
6125	Okay .
6126	Yeah , I am think about it too .
6127	Format .
6128	Well , it looked more than a bunny than a cat , but it works ,
6129	right ?
6130	With a very small legs .
6131	It it should be a cat .
6132	Yeah .
6133	Okay ?
6134	I am guessing a horse .
6135	Well , I will give it a try .
6136	Very good .
6137	I was very good in drawing .
6138	You should feed that that animal .
6139	Well , I guess you get the idea .
6140	Yes , okay .
6141	Beautiful .
6142	Beautiful .
6143	Okay , so you can use this at any time during the presentation if you want to .
6144	any questions well , just just let me know .
6145	okay ,
6146	back to our project .
6147	the remote control we are going to develop will have a selling price of about twenty five Euros .
6148	the profit we are looking for for this product is fifty million Euros , which is quite a number .
6149	we we will focus this internationally , so the product will be sold , if there is market interest , in in more than one country .
6150	And the production costs should not be more than twelve Euro fifty ,
6151	so we should keep that in mind by w w during the development ,
6152	because , well , those are important numbers .
6153	then the discussion ,
6154	maybe the time for Sebastian to show his presentation .
6155	Yes , I have some technical issues which I would like to present to you before we start the discussion ,
6156	because there might be some influations influences .
6157	Limitations .
6158	Okay .
6159	Okay .
6160	Okay ?
6161	Okay .
6162	Okay , great .
6163	first about my role , role of the Industrial Designer .
6164	I would like to think about the implementation of of things , and the technical possibilities and impossibilities .
6165	So if someone of you comes up with ideas , I will try to translate them in technical functions ,
6166	but there might be some impossibilities .
6167	So that is one .
6168	I also will propose some some implementations for that ,
6169	but well , these are quite the same .
6170	Sorry about that .
6171	and I also will remind people of some new technical possibilities which are available
6172	and which might be interesting to implement in our product .
6173	Okay .
6174	I have some initial ideas about some things
6175	which are maybe nice to take with you in the upcoming discussion .
6176	One thing about interopera operability .
6177	I think a modern remote control should control a device diverse subset of equipment .
6178	for instance , DVD players , cell phones , video and audio equipment .
6179	So one re one remote control for all your equipment .
6180	And for a cell phone ?
6181	Yeah , okay .
6182	Well , there should be some interoperabi interoperability between them .
6183	Yeah .
6184	I think it could come in handy .
6185	We should discuss that .
6186	and we should think about the way how these things should communicate with each other .
6187	We are not living in the nineteen eighties anymore , so infrared is not is not really hot technical stuff anymore .
6188	But you should think about the things like Bluetooth .
6189	But
6190	Yeah , but the infrared , it is , well , a little bit old fashioned , if you would call it like that .
6191	But it is cost effective .
6192	But all the TVs are equipped with infrared , so
6193	y you
6194	you can
6195	Most of them .
6196	Yes .
6197	Well , not all , not all .
6198	So that is the point .
6199	So
6200	Maybe ,
6201	but that is something we should discuss and about every everybody should think about it .
6202	Or you shou sh use a
6203	you should equip infrared and Bluetooth together in one remote .
6204	Yeah .
6205	So that is just my role ,
6206	I will just give you everybody some technical input ,
6207	and I think now the time is to have a little discussion about what the product should be and how it should look , but take these things into account when you start the discussion .
6208	Yeah .
6209	Okay ,
6210	so the the main por the main points you are telling us
6211	are focus on the inter operability ,
6212	and
6213	Okay ,
6214	and and
6215	Okay .
6216	Yes ,
6217	so one thing one remote control should control one or more pieces of equipment , and the way of communicating with these equipments .
6218	Okay , good .
6219	Okay .
6220	that was your presentation ?
6221	Okay , okay .
6222	That is it .
6223	okay .
6224	Great .
6225	I will go back to my own presentation .
6226	Okay .
6227	I I do think it is time now to to discuss some things .
6228	Sebastian told us a few things about the technical implemen implications .
6229	there are other things like how to make it trendy , which is I think most Ru Ruud is role .
6230	the way how it should be controlled by the user , which is Roo r during this part .
6231	so let is start with you .
6232	H how do you think the remote should function for the user ?
6233	Yep .
6234	Well , I had a few things in mind .
6235	well , the interoperability , just like Sebastian said , the remote should work on different TVs or even different
6236	Yeah , what is it ,
6237	devices ?
6238	so i
6239	i
6240	I think it is a universal remote control for customers to buy just new in a store .
6241	Yes , I think it should be something like that .
6242	It is not for for for Philips or whatever to buy our remote for their own product ,
6243	right ?
6244	Yeah , I do I do not know that .
6245	Okay , so we are we are going business to consumer ,
6246	not we are we are it is not a
6247	No .
6248	It is no I have
6249	do not have the information for it .
6250	We are not developing this product for a specific vendor , are we ?
6251	No ,
6252	we are just developing this product , and we want to sell it to a very broad public , so it should fit to every device .
6253	No .
6254	No , okay .
6255	Yeah .
6256	Yeah .
6257	Ruud , y do you agree ?
6258	Okay .
6259	Yeah , I think I think they are right ,
6260	yeah .
6261	Okay .
6262	Well , the techni fu technical function what you said is just by pressing the button you should change the state of the TV .
6263	That is just the basic f technical function .
6264	Yeah .
6265	So that was my really my part for this session .
6266	Well , that is just the fu the technical function is pure what should the remote control do , wh what is his task as an as an device .
6267	So is that ease of use or is that more like
6268	Okay .
6269	Yeah .
6270	It just should change the TV is state .
6271	So that is it .
6272	but furthermore
6273	Yeah .
6274	And you you see the buttons as a as a means of doing this ?
6275	Or are there any o other controls ?
6276	Are there only any other cont
6277	Well ,
6278	I I have seen these remote controls with this little stick which you can move forward , sidewords .
6279	Yeah , with buttons .
6280	Yeah , or maybe you want a touch screen or
6281	But
6282	Yeah .
6283	Uh huh .
6284	You know these things .
6285	And it is very easy for a user to to switch
6286	w yes ,
6287	to to switch b between channels or change between tracks on a on a CD , on on a chapters , you know , on a DVD player .
6288	They are very vu vulnerable .
6289	Yeah .
6290	So maybe that is an idea , I do not know .
6291	Yeah .
6292	And for other user interface I had , well , it is more industrial thing .
6293	point at a TV
6294	, I think it is it is quite disturbing when you always have to point directly to the TV ,
6295	so you must point everywhere ,
6296	so maybe infrared is
6297	Yeah , just do not even point it ,
6298	so in that case infrared should maybe be restriction to that .
6299	Okay .
6300	Maybe not even pointed .
6301	Yeah .
6302	Okay
6303	Okay , gentlemen , just a reminder , we d we have five minutes left for this meeting
6304	okay .
6305	is that
6306	are there restriction for the range , the operating range too ?
6307	So when you are not able to point at the device the range is very limited .
6308	Yeah , if you g if you go to radio or or yeah .
6309	For TV , you are always in in the neighbourhood of a TV ,
6310	so I do not think think the range should be a problem to that , but if you want to get it working with a radio , and you are in outside your garden with just one speaker , then maybe the range should be
6311	But
6312	Yeah .
6313	Okay .
6314	Okay .
6315	Two more things .
6316	You should able to feel the buttons without it mis
6317	you have to know what you do without looking at the buttons ,
6318	so it should be as user interface for feeling should be good to understand .
6319	You must feel the buttons for volume or whatever , I think .
6320	Okay , s yeah .
6321	Yeah .
6322	And of course you do not always know where all buttons are ,
6323	so it should be visible al in dark too .
6324	So when it is dark
6325	Those are two really user interface
6326	Yeah .
6327	Okay .
6328	I will write down glow in the dark .
6329	That is perfect .
6330	Is tha
6331	Okay .
6332	Okay .
6333	Okay , I just want to hear Ruud is input for this meeting .
6334	Do do you
6335	well yes , I had , about three minutes ago , but I have seem to forget them forgot them .
6336	do you have anything already w ab idea about how the market will respond to the such a product ?
6337	Or what we should take in account when developing such a product ?
6338	I think most most things have already been said , like control multiple devices .
6339	And , yeah , infrared might be an issue .
6340	Because ?
6341	well , he said about n abo
6342	what he said about pointing .
6343	But lots of devices already use infrared .
6344	So we will probably have to implement that .
6345	Okay .
6346	Okay .
6347	Okay , Sebastian , did you have any other ideas ?
6348	Okay .
6349	oh yes , I remember .
6350	you said something about visibility in the dark .
6351	would it be nice for a user to have display on this remote control , on which you can see functions ?
6352	Which makes it easier to operate it .
6353	Yeah .
6354	Yeah .
6355	Well , maybe I
6356	but it it can be quite simple , you can just have white buttons with a black mark on it .
6357	I I do not know .
6358	Okay .
6359	The the the digits in black .
6360	then it is already visible in dark .
6361	Okay .
6362	So it it do not have to be a lightning or or a fancy well , it can be for design , of course .
6363	Okay .
6364	Yeah ,
6365	yeah ,
6366	okay ,
6367	because because we wa we want to develop a trendy product .
6368	Yes , but there is a cost limitation too .
6369	So
6370	Yeah ,
6371	twelve Euro fifty ,
6372	yeah .
6373	Well , that is more
6374	So that is a big problem , I think .
6375	I think the the financial part of this project implicates that it is not going to be a high high end product .
6376	The cost price is very low .
6377	Okay .
6378	Okay .
6379	Just remind something .
6380	The digits of the the painting on the buttons should not fade .
6381	Okay , okay .
6382	You have a m
6383	Always have s the soft buttons , always clear the the the paint on it .
6384	Very good point .
6385	Yeah .
6386	The marks .
6387	Okay .
6388	Okay ,
6389	I
6390	ha I have one point f
6391	which which comes in mind now .
6392	d I think the device should either be rechargeable very easily or it should not consume too much power .
6393	Okay .
6394	Because it is very annoying if you need to change the batteries every s every other week .
6395	Yeah .
6396	Okay .
6397	So
6398	maybe we could for example only light the buttons that are applicable at that moment or
6399	yeah .
6400	But
6401	Necessary ,
6402	yeah .
6403	I dunno ,
6404	it is
6405	that is more Sebastian is
6406	Well does it ?
6407	I am not sure .
6408	Yeah .
6409	But then Bluetooth might be problem .
6410	Cause I think Bluetooth
6411	Yeah ,
6412	I know it from the cell phone .
6413	It is use a lot of
6414	well
6415	Well , cell phones have integrated Bluetooth also and , well , it is it seems to work quite okay .
6416	Yeah .
6417	So technically it will be possible .
6418	But you ca not you ca not use Bluetooth all the time , twenty four hours a day .
6419	No , you cannot .
6420	Okay .
6421	Does it
6422	It is over ?
6423	Okay .
6424	Gentlemen , I am afraid we do not have any more time .
6425	Okay .
6426	so we will go back to our own work .
6427	next meeting starts in thirty minutes and , well , you know your o your individual actions or your personal coach will probably email you about th it .
6428	so
6429	this was it .
6430	 
6431	Welcome back .
6432	Hello .
6433	Hello .
6434	let me see .
6435	There is one of mine .
6436	Okay .
6437	Roo , welcome back .
6438	Hello , Flores .
6439	The waiting is for Sebastian .
6440	There he is .
6441	We have a slight problem .
6442	Is there any time for a cup of coffee ?
6443	Can I get a cup of coffee ?
6444	Okay .
6445	I opened the CD ROM box guys .
6446	Sorry ?
6447	no .
6448	You ca not ,
6449	sorry .
6450	So
6451	just cancel it .
6452	Well ,
6453	during my work I have no time either .
6454	So
6455	I think so too .
6456	Well ,
6457	this is life .
6458	Sorry
6459	, Roo .
6460	Yeah ,
6461	I opened the CD ROM box .
6462	Okay .
6463	Accidentally .
6464	Okay .
6465	But it is alright .
6466	People , welcome back with the second meeting .
6467	for now on the schedule are a few points .
6468	first of all the opening , which we are doing now .
6469	second , I received some new project requirements .
6470	I am not sure if you received them as well ,
6471	but I will tell you about it .
6472	then the three of you prepared a presentation , I think ?
6473	Sebastian ?
6474	Roo ?
6475	Ruud ?
6476	Almost , okay .
6477	Yeah .
6478	Almost .
6479	Then we will do your one as la the last .
6480	the top goal of this m
6481	we will figure that out .
6482	But you ca not upload your presentation from here , I believe .
6483	Okay .
6484	Ca can you try to
6485	Yeah ,
6486	w we will see .
6487	if it if it if it is wireless
6488	I could just put it in the .
6489	I do not think it is wireless here .
6490	it is , yeah .
6491	It is .
6492	Or it is .
6493	It is .
6494	Yeah ?
6495	Okay , great .
6496	okay .
6497	Yeah .
6498	the top goal of this meeting is to reach a decision on the product , on the target group and and the functions of the remote control ,
6499	so keep that in mind .
6500	we have forty minutes .
6501	So
6502	it is now
6503	Yep .
6504	Okay .
6505	the new project requirements , first of all , we did not speak about it , but we should not support teletext in the remote , because our b board feels that teletext is out of date and internet is replacing teletext .
6506	So we are not even going to try to implement it in our product .
6507	It is a board decision .
6508	the remote control should only be used for television , because it is not f feasible ,
6509	it is not w
6510	we we cannot make it because of the time to market that we have to deal with .
6511	Yeah .
6512	Time ,
6513	yeah .
6514	the third requirement is that we should focus on customers that are younger than forty , which is important for you , Ruud , and as well for Roo .
6515	Because the product should be interesting and and should be bought by people younger than forty .
6516	then for Roo , as well important , the corporate image should be recognisable in our product .
6517	So the colour colours and the slogan do have to be in the product .
6518	Yes .
6519	Is that clear ?
6520	Any questions on these requirements ?
6521	No ?
6522	Okay .
6523	the individual presentations ,
6524	I th
6525	Roo or Sebastian , who of you would like to start ?
6526	yeah .
6527	Yeah , I will start .
6528	Yes .
6529	Okay ,
6530	great .
6531	Oh ,
6532	how can I
6533	Geez , and sli and show .
6534	Just press it .
6535	yes .
6536	Alright .
6537	well
6538	w we we had discussed this already in the fin in the previous discussion .
6539	the method of the remote control is just
6540	the function of remote control is basically to send messages to the television set .
6541	So that was the main important thing what a remote control should do .
6542	Yeah .
6543	Then I found two different kind of remote controls , the multi function remote control with many possibilities , but the lack of the feeling I already mentioned in the previous discussion .
6544	And the ease of use remote control with the less p possibilities but a great feeling in in touching the buttons .
6545	Yeah .
6546	but yeah .
6547	My personal preferences were ease of the easy to use remote control ,
6548	because the user friendliness and it can be more trendy in in user design .
6549	But your new goal f was for people than less than forty years old .
6550	Uh huh .
6551	So maybe the multi function can be implemented in in our design .
6552	But it should b
6553	I think it should be a combination ,
6554	but teletext buttons are not in our design .
6555	So it should take out , well , eight buttons or so .
6556	But my in my opinion , the the easy to use RC is the best possi possibility for us .
6557	Okay .
6558	Ruud , did you get that ?
6559	Okay , so
6560	the important thing here is In the market ,
6561	yeah .
6562	Yeah , b most .
6563	Yeah .
6564	And it is also i indeed Ruud is insight in the in the topic .
6565	Oh ,
6566	user friendly .
6567	Yeah ,
6568	what what does the market want ?
6569	I I do not know .
6570	Yeah , okay ,
6571	w we will s we all
6572	Yeah .
6573	Just for for user desi user friendliness I should choose for the the ease of use remote control .
6574	Okay .
6575	Sebastian .
6576	Okay .
6577	Excuse me .
6578	Scusi .
6579	Okay ,
6580	it is still the right thing .
6581	Okay .
6582	well ,
6583	there are some changes in the design requirements , so there are some changes in the method also .
6584	basically all this device has to do is send messages to a TV set .
6585	And the m most easy way to do this is by sending pulses of infrared light to a TV set .
6586	Well ,
6587	I th
6588	I tried to implement a picture here , but it is hardly readable .
6589	Energies and
6590	Yeah .
6591	Can you see it ?
6592	No ?
6593	Well ,
6594	there is a energy source here .
6595	No , it is not visible .
6596	And basically
6597	there
6598	it is connected to three things .
6599	The user interface connected to a chip , which is connected to the sender , which generates messages using infrared light , which are sent to the receiver .
6600	That is basically the idea .
6601	And there is a little picture , just for your imagination , how a device like this should look or can look .
6602	Okay .
6603	what have I found .
6604	Usually these kind of things consist of a battery , infrared diode , buttons , chips , and circuit board .
6605	That is all .
6606	It is cased together , nothing more than that .
6607	It is almost every piece of equipment every piece of every TV set is controlled infrared .
6608	There are some exceptions , but most of all have infrared controls .
6609	And the more luxury remote controls have lithium buttons .
6610	And I think that is what we w
6611	yes .
6612	The glow in the dark concept we discussed .
6613	In the
6614	and it is a little more a little bit more fancy also .
6615	So maybe we should consider that .
6616	Yeah .
6617	Okay .
6618	Okay .
6619	I have a basic scheme of the things which are implemented .
6620	basically this is all there is .
6621	There is just one chip .
6622	There are a few buttons connected .
6623	the buttons are lit .
6624	And the whole thing is transmitted by a infrared li diode , and there is not a power source here .
6625	So
6626	that is basically the total design of this piece of equipment .
6627	There is nothing more to it .
6628	So it is fairly easy .
6629	It is fairly easy .
6630	It is been done many times before , and I think we should we should c s succeed in in our plan to do this .
6631	Okay .
6632	Succeed in it also .
6633	Okay ,
6634	good .
6635	So Okay , so
6636	personally I think we should infra use infrared ,
6637	because otherwise our device cannot communicate with almost every TV set .
6638	So I think that should be clear .
6639	Okay .
6640	another important point is we really should use energy sparse , friendly components .
6641	there are specially designed energy friendly components which consume far less power than conventional components .
6642	And if we want to use a rechargeable design or a energy save design , we should really implement them .
6643	for cost effectiveness , we should really use a very low cost circuit board ,
6644	because most of the production cost are are in this part of the equipment .
6645	Okay .
6646	And the money we save on using this we can use for elaborate fancy lighting techniques , blinking LEDs and all that kind of fancy stuff .
6647	I think our users will really will really like that .
6648	And what is the
6649	if we use the LEDs , i does it use much more energy
6650	or
6651	Okay .
6652	No , they are p f power friendly LEDs also .
6653	So we can use them .
6654	So that is no problem .
6655	For the same costs ,
6656	it is can be in our
6657	Combined with the low cost circuit board
6658	so it is
6659	Yeah .
6660	no , they are they are a little bit more expensive ,
6661	but by making
6662	We can we can make its I think .
6663	Well
6664	you could only lit the buttons the buttons that are used most .
6665	So , the channel switching .
6666	Yeah .
6667	Or
6668	, true .
6669	Yeah ,
6670	but but the question is whether two or four buttons makes m makes such a difference in the costs if you already plan to include fancy lightning techniques , I guess .
6671	Okay .
6672	But I think
6673	Yeah ,
6674	I think it is the same as in the cell phone , just light in in the device that that shines on all the buttons ,
6675	and not for
6676	Yeah , but not for each button one LED , I think .
6677	Yes .
6678	Well ,
6679	it is not one light ,
6680	it
6681	there are more lights in a in a in a mobile device .
6682	No no
6683	no , no .
6684	That is right , that is right .
6685	Okay .
6686	So well ,
6687	this should be it .
6688	Okay .
6689	have a think about it .
6690	Yeah .
6691	Okay ,
6692	Ruud .
6693	Oh , mine is already outdated .
6694	Okay well ,
6695	we ar we are very curio curious to what the market will feel about such a product .
6696	Since
6697	Okay ,
6698	make
6699	Well
6700	then I am sure the target market is ten million units .
6701	So any income is welcome .
6702	Input .
6703	Of of which we should sell about forty percent to make the five million .
6704	Could you step a little bit more to the right ?
6705	Yeah ,
6706	thank you .
6707	Okay .
6708	But since the other part is forty percent of the market ,
6709	I thought earlier we might want to constrain that portion of the market .
6710	But since the requirements changed ,
6711	that is not a good idea .
6712	well ,
6713	skip this .
6714	Yeah .
6715	Well ,
6716	it is
6717	this till true , of course .
6718	That they only use ten percent the buttons .
6719	The buttons to zap are used the about fifteen hundred times , when the power button is only used one time .
6720	And the volume button is only four times .
6721	So they are obv obviously the most important buttons .
6722	And lots of people complained they kin ca not find their remote control .
6723	So we might want to build in a feature to support them .
6724	Some audio signal .
6725	Like home phones .
6726	Okay .
6727	Or
6728	Yeah .
6729	Well ,
6730	that is interesting .
6731	Or a find a finding function ,
6732	you know .
6733	Yeah .
6734	Yeah ,
6735	that is definitely interesting .
6736	That is quite a
6737	yes .
6738	It it separates our product from others as well .
6739	Sound signal .
6740	Yeah .
6741	Okay ,
6742	go on .
6743	Yes .
6744	Well ,
6745	I just said that .
6746	And well ,
6747	this obvious , and he also said it .
6748	Okay .
6749	So
6750	that is what the market tells us .
6751	that is about it , yes .
6752	Yep .
6753	Okay .
6754	The volume and the zap buttons are the mostly used .
6755	mo zap buttons most .
6756	So
6757	Yeah , well
6758	it should just have a design
6759	The perfect design for those only those buttons .
6760	Volume , they are use a lot .
6761	But more than all the other buttons .
6762	So
6763	Yeah , that is a problem .
6764	Yes .
6765	And first
6766	Yeah .
6767	Yes , we should focus on that , I guess .
6768	Yep .
6769	Well ,
6770	the technical there
6771	I think there are no technical difficulties .
6772	There is no elaborate technique used in this kind of equipment .
6773	So
6774	I do not think we have any hiccups there .
6775	So we can fully concentrate on developing a product that is really what the market needs .
6776	So maybe it is a good idea to think about these buttons and and and a sound signal .
6777	Yeah ,
6778	the sound signal .
6779	Just one thing
6780	I am just wondering , the sound signal , from where do you execute th the s sound ?
6781	Another device is not a solution .
6782	Well
6783	Yes .
6784	Th that is a bit of that is a problem .
6785	Yeah .
6786	Well
6787	maybe maybe like clapping in your hands , like turning on and off the the the lights .
6788	Usually
6789	Oh yes .
6790	It should be
6791	Yeah ,
6792	but maybe you will get some new technologies for it .
6793	Yes .
6794	Well ,
6795	there there are some devices who incorporate this technique already .
6796	there are video sets and they have a special button , the find the remote control button .
6797	You press it and your TV set starts to make a kind of weird sound , and your remote controls then start to beep .
6798	Reports rep respend response to it .
6799	And
6800	Yes .
6801	Yeah ,
6802	just like the phones
6803	the
6804	But but TVs do not have all buttons .
6805	Yes , that is it .
6806	Yes , same thing .
6807	Yeah .
6808	But th
6809	Yeah ,
6810	because we do not have a a a a a home
6811	Okay .
6812	No ,
6813	so we we should use something else .
6814	And you
6815	Yeah ,
6816	and usually
6817	And even if the TV set would have such a button , you would have to walk to your TV ,
6818	and it is
6819	And b
6820	So if if you would be watching a movie , it would constantly beep .
6821	But I believe you will have an
6822	I am convinced Sebastian will find one solution for us .
6823	We do not control the TV set so well .
6824	Yes , m yes .
6825	S
6826	and we b we want to make
6827	so it is is easy as possible for our customers ,
6828	so we should think about
6829	It is quite complicated .
6830	So
6831	what about the clapping technique ?
6832	because you se
6833	Well ,
6834	you see it a lot in in light lightning
6835	Yeah , a peak .
6836	Well ,
6837	it is quite complicated .
6838	Because how can you separate the clapping sound from other sounds .
6839	Yes , yes .
6840	Well , basically
6841	the characteristics the characteristics of clapping is just an increase in the volume , the amplitude of the sound , which is generated a few times within a certain period of time .
6842	Yeah .
6843	Yeah .
6844	But there are many other sounds which are exactly the same from the point of view from a remote control .
6845	Yeah , that is true .
6846	Yes ,
6847	so we do not want that .
6848	But we can have just a home stat f a base station next to the TV .
6849	Maybe we can
6850	Something like that .
6851	Just a little antenna or something .
6852	Well
6853	if you lost th
6854	I do not think people would bother walking to the TV and press that button because they lost the their remote .
6855	Well ,
6856	is there not something
6857	f something more easily
6858	Well ,
6859	I do not think .
6860	Well
6861	Yeah .
6862	that is just
6863	just a base station next to the TV is the best possibility .
6864	No ,
6865	and y the
6866	the most important thing for people is that there is a central point to which they can go and b perform a a some kind of .
6867	And then the remote control reports itself ,
6868	so
6869	w we should use have
6870	we should use something like that .
6871	You do not want another device , which can be everywhere in the house , which you have to find first before you can find your remote control .
6872	Yes , something like that .
6873	But that will be very costly , I think .
6874	So that is not a good idea .
6875	Yeah ,
6876	m maybe w we we do agree on on the thing that the remote should have such a function , if it is possible within the costs and all that kind of things .
6877	Yeah .
6878	maybe Sebastian should have a detailed look later on and come up with a solution ,
6879	because that is his his field of expertise .
6880	I will .
6881	Yeah .
6882	Yes .
6883	Yes .
6884	But before I do that I w I want to warn you that by implementing this kind of a function the technical design will become more complicated and it will become more costly also .
6885	Yep .
6886	Because there will be additional components which which will be used .
6887	And there are some implepe imp
6888	Well ,
6889	I I think so ,
6890	because when you have a p newspaper over your remote control , you cannot see it .
6891	And do we even prefer the sound above the the LEDs , the lightning function ?
6892	It is a unique item It will be an a unique feature of our remote control .
6893	So
6894	Okay .
6895	Yeah , it is a distinction in the market .
6896	It is a different
6897	exactly .
6898	Yeah .
6899	It is an uni an unique feature , and I think it is worth looking and and probably more i interesting than than the lights .
6900	Yeah .
6901	And just about the user interface , I came up with an easy remote control and an advanced remote control .
6902	Yeah .
6903	What should we choose in in design ?
6904	Well , the extra functions .
6905	Yeah .
6906	Well ,
6907	according to Ruud , people do not use all the extra features very very often .
6908	So
6909	Okay .
6910	I have the numbers r I have the numbers right here .
6911	Well , t
6912	we wo not support teletext which which was the third most the second most used function .
6913	Used option .
6914	Okay .
6915	Well ,
6916	we we do have a wise board ,
6917	so I am not questioning that .
6918	well yeah ,
6919	channel selection is obviously the most important .
6920	Yeah .
6921	Okay , so
6922	on the relevance scale the channel selection , the volume selection and the teletext .
6923	So
6924	Yeah .
6925	Well ,
6926	we skip that .
6927	Yeah .
6928	So
6929	Nope .
6930	Well ,
6931	so it just th the basic functions .
6932	Okay .
6933	And we do not have to use it for DVD players and all kind of stuff .
6934	No , no .
6935	No .
6936	So
6937	Yeah .
6938	So
6939	that is out of the question .
6940	Yeah .
6941	So
6942	I think also .
6943	Just through the easy design .
6944	I think we should go for the easier one .
6945	We can make a nice design when when there is not mu much buttons in it .
6946	Yes .
6947	So
6948	just a few buttons , trendy design , nice lightning effects wh and the sound .
6949	Well ,
6950	we should save costs by not implementing a lot of functions
6951	and the money that we can save from that we should use for having a nice design and thinking about the user interface
6952	and
6953	Yeah , that is right .
6954	No .
6955	Yeah .
6956	Okay ,
6957	Ruud , how do you feel about that ?
6958	do you agree ,
6959	do you think the market would would respond to a simple
6960	well
6961	if we include other innovative functions then they might , cause young people like new features .
6962	yeah .
6963	So
6964	And if you use that stick for volume control and channel selection , you have the m two most important functions in one button .
6965	Okay , so
6966	this is is kind of
6967	Yeah .
6968	Okay .
6969	Well ,
6970	is it
6971	maybe there is another possibility .
6972	You can make it look like an easy s piece of equipment , but it is quite elaborated ,
6973	because it has many functions .
6974	Maybe it is more important to make the make it look like a very friendly , easy to catch piece of equipment ,
6975	but nevertheless
6976	But but are we not in in the in the manual
6977	I mean if you have few buttons , no display , I mean I guess it is l it is working with with a shift functions and one button
6978	can
6979	But but how does how does the remote report r give back to the user w in what state it is ?
6980	Because we do not implement a user history .
6981	Ok like that .
6982	Well ,
6983	I was more thinking about a more elaborate way of controlling , by by these kinds of sticks or something like that .
6984	I do not know if if it is user friendly .
6985	That is your field of expertise .
6986	Yeah ,
6987	I do not know yet .
6988	There is no , but there is no way to do that , because we cannot implement that kind of the system .
6989	I know , but
6990	but if we use like a stick , for example ,
6991	Yeah .
6992	W
6993	Well ,
6994	maybe we can use a light for that .
6995	When you move the stick to a to a position , maybe a light next to it can lit up .
6996	So you know I have just pushed the button , or I changed the channel or t turned up the volume .
6997	Something like that .
6998	Yes .
6999	and we could have other buttons for the for the advanced functions .
7000	But does it I
7001	then should n just use i instead of the stick , like many cell phones , just a round
7002	m
7003	well ,
7004	should we just use a it is already
7005	oh , we have a blank .
7006	Yeah ,
7007	draw draw it on the board .
7008	Oh .
7009	Oh
7010	yeah , something like that .
7011	It is not really a stick ,
7012	but
7013	Yes .
7014	It is just an easy way of of a round button what which can be pushed in four directions .
7015	Yes .
7016	Instead of a stick .
7017	A stick is v vulnerab vulnerable when it is falling down
7018	or
7019	just a round button should be the trick , I think .
7020	Yeah , it can break down .
7021	Yes , yes .
7022	Yeah .
7023	And
7024	Yes , and this also looks more fancy , I think .
7025	I think it it will attract more public , I think .
7026	Yeah .
7027	A younger Huh .
7028	But you are the marketing man .
7029	And it is also quite easy to use , so it will it attract younger people because well new , and it might attract older people because it is easy to use .
7030	Geez .
7031	Well ,
7032	volume and something like that .
7033	Uh huh .
7034	The programme up and down .
7035	Okay , yeah .
7036	And the vol
7037	yeah ,
7038	the pen does not really does what I want .
7039	Okay , that is good .
7040	Okay ,
7041	but w we still we are still in the question of putting in advanced options .
7042	Ruud just told us the market is interested in some advanced new techniques .
7043	however , keeping it simple is is important for the costs and all all those kind of things .
7044	We need to find a balance between the advanced techniques and and the user friendliness .
7045	But I think our our next step to look at is just that .
7046	So I do not think it is we have something to do .
7047	we ca not discuss it right now , because n no one of us have has the information to discuss about that , I think .
7048	well ,
7049	for
7050	we do have to decide this this meeting .
7051	Yes ?
7052	Yeah .
7053	We need to have the the user function the functions decided and our target audience .
7054	Okay .
7055	Kay ,
7056	but teletext is so is just scrapped .
7057	Okay .
7058	Do do you want a list of functions ?
7059	Do you want an explicit list ? which incorporates all function available on the device ?
7060	Okay .
7061	well ,
7062	I do not want a full
7063	it is not necessary to to have a full list , but I want the kind of functions , for example th the most important are volume and programme selecting .
7064	Okay .
7065	The ten digits .
7066	Well ,
7067	for example , that that is what we should think about .
7068	l
7069	how is the remote going to look ?
7070	Not not in the user interface , but
7071	Yeah .
7072	Oh ,
7073	and just one function .
7074	The the the the programme to programme button , the switch to two channels , when you have something on channel four and something on channel six , just one button which which can change
7075	yeah .
7076	Yes .
7077	A bit of a split mode .
7078	Change .
7079	l like Yeah .
7080	Yes , yes .
7081	Dual channel watch .
7082	Yes .
7083	Yeah .
7084	Okay , well
7085	m maybe I should write that down .
7086	Well
7087	you are the secretary .
7088	Ruud , what is your last name ?
7089	Mielsen ,
7090	because I I was writing it down in the last
7091	Mielsen .
7092	Mielsen .
7093	Right .
7094	I put all the minutes I make into the shared folder .
7095	So if you want to have a look at it , you know where to find it .
7096	okay ,
7097	but make a s make a sub folder for it ,
7098	because it is starting to fill up already .
7099	Alright .
7100	Yeah ,
7101	that is that is
7102	if you want to do it , Sebastian .
7103	Yeah .
7104	Sure .
7105	Our BSC W
7106	The ten digits ?
7107	Yeah , I believe so .
7108	Okay ,
7109	Okay ,
7110	so so
7111	Volume .
7112	Programme .
7113	dual channel .
7114	And and do we want the ten digits ?
7115	Yeah .
7116	Yes , that is important .
7117	Well ,
7118	are are you sure ?
7119	I am not so sure .
7120	Well ,
7121	if you want to go to channel ninety
7122	and you have th that button .
7123	Yeah .
7124	Well ,
7125	that is complicated ,
7126	but is that so relevant ?
7127	Because I do not think
7128	but you should shou you should know that .
7129	I would not buy it personally .
7130	If it were so .
7131	A remote control without the ten digits .
7132	Okay ,
7133	I can imagine when
7134	I can imagine when you are when you have a satellite decoder and and you have , well , about six hundred channels , I can imagine you want this .
7135	and I think the most
7136	Just elder elder people would would buy it ,
7137	but
7138	Yep .
7139	I agree actually .
7140	Well
7141	But
7142	Yeah ,
7143	and if if we
7144	And if we are targeting at the younger audience , they will probably watch more channels than the older people .
7145	But if you are a regular TV user , and you just want to watch the the Dutch television networks , well , you can you can use about ten buttons .
7146	But we do have thirteen different Dutch channels .
7147	That is enough .
7148	The older people only use five of them .
7149	Well ,
7150	but how how often do you watch all these channels ?
7151	No , you are probably right .
7152	Often .
7153	So
7154	Well
7155	And
7156	And there are some numbers about speech recognition here that younger people would like it .
7157	Yeah .
7158	Okay .
7159	But I think these ten buttons look a bit dull .
7160	Do not you think ?
7161	The design .
7162	Well ,
7163	it depends on the on the on the looks ,
7164	on the on the
7165	You c you can d make them very fancy
7166	by
7167	I mean Nokia , they have ten digits on their phones
7168	and it still looks very fancy .
7169	On the design .
7170	Okay .
7171	Well ,
7172	y
7173	then there should be should done be done something specific with it .
7174	Yeah .
7175	So I am I am
7176	I do not agree
7177	Exactly , exactly .
7178	Okay ,
7179	so you can experiment by with with shape or with size or with colour , that kind of thing .
7180	Okay .
7181	it might be expensive and hard to implement ,
7182	but it would be a solution for
7183	Yeah .
7184	Okay ,
7185	speech .
7186	Well ,
7187	maybe it can be combined with the find the remote control .
7188	Yeah .
7189	So
7190	when you add speech recognition to your remote control , it is very easy to change the channel .
7191	Yeah .
7192	That is one thing .
7193	And it is very easy to find your remote control .
7194	To find
7195	yeah .
7196	So maybe that is a possibility ,
7197	but I am afraid it will be a bit costly .
7198	But maybe when we
7199	If if we would drop the ten digits but keep the programme and the volume ,
7200	because maybe people do not always want to use their voice ,
7201	Yeah .
7202	Okay .
7203	Okay , okay .
7204	Especially elder people do not like voice recognition .
7205	So then we should implement such a but
7206	Yes .
7207	But we do focus on younger people .
7208	We d it
7209	it is a board decision .
7210	Okay .
7211	Well .
7212	I I think it should should work , it sh we should manage that .
7213	So
7214	we have to i to make a decision between the ten digits or the voice recognition .
7215	Okay .
7216	Yes .
7217	Well ,
7218	the voice recognition has the main adva has another advantage .
7219	It is mas it makes it very easy for us to implement the find find the remote control button remote control function .
7220	So that is that is a big advantage , I think .
7221	Okay .
7222	Okay , g good .
7223	Okay .
7224	There is only one disadvantage by implementing this .
7225	the power saving power saving will be a bit more difficult .
7226	So we can expect that there will be a less longer life to the batteries .
7227	But maybe can we we can think something smart about it .
7228	Yep .
7229	There are some hybrid hybrid devices which incorporate a solar panel and rechargeable batteries .
7230	Okay .
7231	So when you just leave the device in a in a light room , it charges itself .
7232	But But but can we manage it bu for the costs ?
7233	Because it seems like a very
7234	Is a cradle very cheap ?
7235	I know ,
7236	b but there should be an adapter as well .
7237	You have to do nothing for it .
7238	M
7239	And if we if we could inc include a c a cradle in which it could recharge , then there would not be a big problem .
7240	Twelve dollar fifty .
7241	Maybe , maybe not .
7242	I will have to find that out .
7243	Yes .
7244	So
7245	No ,
7246	that is very cheap .
7247	Cause when
7248	Yeah .
7249	It is
7250	Oh ,
7251	it is very cheap .
7252	That is no problem .
7253	It is just a a case with two metal contacts .
7254	It is
7255	Yes ,
7256	but they are they are mass production .
7257	They are very cheap .
7258	So it will cost us p practically nothing .
7259	Okay .
7260	Okay .
7261	We we have about ten minutes left this meeting .
7262	I would like to hear maybe
7263	maybe you all have th things not spoken about ,
7264	yeah ,
7265	but that are important .
7266	Ruud , you you came up with the voice recognition data .
7267	are there other things about the market we should know ?
7268	Okay .
7269	I think we dealt with the most important information .
7270	Just that the younger part of the market is not the forty percent we want to sell to .
7271	So we we should for least a bit look at the older people .
7272	But with buttons like that , which are easy to use , we might attract them too .
7273	So I do not think that is a big problem
7274	Yes .
7275	Okay .
7276	Yeah .
7277	Okay , so
7278	although we are focussing on younger people to make it profitable Profitable .
7279	Profitable .
7280	Yeah , profitable .
7281	We we
7282	yeah ,
7283	we still need to take in account the the bit older people .
7284	Yes .
7285	Okay .
7286	O okay .
7287	Roo .
7288	I have nothing nothing to add , I think .
7289	Nothing to add .
7290	Sebastian ?
7291	Yeah ?
7292	Great .
7293	I just want to make a summary of all all things spoken and the different possibilities .
7294	so basically
7295	we have decided to implement a seemingly easy design .
7296	So
7297	on the outside it looks easy , but we can make it easy on the inside or elaborate on the inside .
7298	So that is one the
7299	those are the choices we have to make .
7300	But I think there is a big advantage in making it more elaborate by implementing speech techniques , voice recognition , that these kinds of things .
7301	Yeah .
7302	it makes it also more attractable , I think , to our audience .
7303	there are some advantages and some disadvantages , and the main advantage is that we can implement fancy techniques , which I think our customers will like .
7304	The disadvantage is that there are some concerns about the the costs and the things like battery lifetime , energy saving .
7305	Yep .
7306	another advantage is that the circuit board will become much more easier if we do not do not implement these buttons .
7307	If we just add a chip which does the voice recognition , our circuit board will become even more cheap .
7308	So that is another
7309	well ,
7310	it wa it w
7311	it was an issue ,
7312	but we also thought that
7313	we already thought we should do it as cheaply as possible .
7314	Yeah ,
7315	and that was the main issue ,
7316	right ?
7317	The the board
7318	Yeah .
7319	And this even makes it more cheapy .
7320	But the cheaper the ch the the chip or th what was it ?
7321	The circuit board .
7322	The board .
7323	The circuit board .
7324	The fewer buttons you can use on it .
7325	The fewer buttons you have , the ch ch the cheaper the circuit board , yes .
7326	No ,
7327	it is th
7328	yeah .
7329	Yeah , okay .
7330	It is the other way around , yeah .
7331	Yeah .
7332	And it is very cheap to incorporate an integrated circuit , a chip .
7333	So that is that is another advantage .
7334	It should not be a big issue .
7335	Well
7336	it
7337	then we should just take a look at the costs and especially for the voice recognition .
7338	So
7339	Yes ,
7340	because I do not know
7341	Yes .
7342	I d
7343	I really do not know .
7344	So
7345	It can be costly .
7346	No .
7347	Okay .
7348	Maybe not .
7349	I am not sure how how we will f determine the costs ,
7350	I will have a look at it .
7351	Maybe you will get some information on that .
7352	Yes .
7353	I am not sure how how that
7354	Yep .
7355	Yes ,
7356	I al
7357	I
7358	I hope my personal coach will have a lo look at it .
7359	Okay , great .
7360	well ,
7361	I think we are qui quite done .
7362	We are done , I think .
7363	for now we will have the lunch break .
7364	How nice .
7365	I am do not know how long the break will be , but we will find out .
7366	Me neither .
7367	then we will have thirty minutes of time to perform our individual work , and I am sure your personal coaches will assist you with it .
7368	I will put the minutes I just made in the project documents folder .
7369	If you want to look at it well , just do .
7370	the Interface Designer , I would like to the next meeting I would like to receive the components concept .
7371	I am sorry ,
7372	yeah ,
7373	I am sorry .
7374	Interface industrial .
7375	Yeah .
7376	User Interface Designer , Roo , I would like to see the user interface c concept .
7377	Well ,
7378	we understand .
7379	And Well ,
7380	i it should be easy , that is w w what we concluded .
7381	the only problem is it that it depends on the divisions the decis decisions Sebastian makes .
7382	Well
7383	yes .
7384	About the voice recognition .
7385	Well
7386	Yeah .
7387	It should be an easy interface with not so much buttons .
7388	S just a a p a p a volume and a programme one .
7389	And yeah , some some fancy lights .
7390	I think that is what we decided .
7391	So we drop the voice recognition ?
7392	Or
7393	Oh .
7394	No no
7395	no , we did not
7396	but it should not be integrated
7397	yeah ,
7398	it is of course it is user interface , but i I was talking about really the design of the
7399	No .
7400	Okay .
7401	Well
7402	do we really have to decide now or can we decide next meeting ?
7403	Okay .
7404	We can decide the next meeting .
7405	Yep .
7406	Because I will have some updated info on that Adapt .
7407	Yeah .
7408	I guess all of you have i updated info .
7409	I am sure the marketing expert will receive t you will do some trend watching .
7410	Yep .
7411	And I am sure the market will will change , adapt
7412	and so
7413	we will see that .
7414	Adapt .
7415	Left .
7416	yeah ,
7417	that is it for now .
7418	That is it .
7419	Kay .
7420	Any other questions
7421	or can we have the lunch ?
7422	Yeah , okay .
7423	 
7424	Do you need to change anything on it ?
7425	Because otherwise I will already open it .
7426	, do not think so .
7427	Okay .
7428	Unless things have suddenly change again .
7429	Is it much changes ?
7430	I did not
7431	No no .
7432	do not know .
7433	Maybe you have got new information , like last time .
7434	I do hot have Only the same information .
7435	Okay .
7436	Hello , Sebastian .
7437	Hello hello Mister PM .
7438	I believe Miss Tentel is with us as well , in the control room .
7439	Well ,
7440	that is where the thinking goes on .
7441	Oh ,
7442	it is that Roo again , always late .
7443	Bongiorno .
7444	Bongiorno .
7445	I think you should punish him .
7446	You are the PM .
7447	Punish .
7448	I see some interesting
7449	okay .
7450	Possibilities , yeah ?
7451	Yes .
7452	You wish .
7453	People , welcome back .
7454	Welcome .
7455	The third meeting .
7456	Yeah .
7457	Oop .
7458	I have some points I would like to some some issues I would like to point out .
7459	first of all , if you make minutes yourself as well , like Sebastian does , could you put them on the shared folder ?
7460	If you do not make minutes , no problem ,
7461	but it is easy for me to see what you wrote down ,
7462	so I could can use that in the in the report .
7463	the second thing , I was th s thinking to myself , I have this little remote control , and I am talking to it ,
7464	but I still need to point to the television , because it works with infrared .
7465	That is quite strange .
7466	Okay .
7467	So
7468	Not at all .
7469	We will come to that later ,
7470	I g I think .
7471	the agenda for now
7472	are there any pre discussion questions ?
7473	Okay .
7474	No .
7475	No .
7476	we wi we will have your individual presentations , then the decision on the remote control concept , and the closing .
7477	Forty minutes in total for this .
7478	So
7479	I think we we can immedis immediately start with the individual presentations , the progress you have made .
7480	Okay .
7481	I think it might be smart to look at Ruud is information first ,
7482	because I understood there are some significant changes in the market situation .
7483	Kay .
7484	Oh .
7485	Alright .
7486	Just press the okay button , it works .
7487	Yeah ,
7488	Okay .
7489	yeah .
7490	Yeah .
7491	Yeah .
7492	My method ?
7493	Well ,
7494	findings .
7495	How surprising .
7496	Ease of use is important , but innovation is more important , and a fancy look and feel is even more important .
7497	And some fashion watchers have found out that the young target group likes fruit and vegetables in their clothes , shoes and furniture , and that they want spongy material .
7498	Probably watch too much Sponge Bob .
7499	the older group still prefers dark colours .
7500	Simple shapes m material .
7501	But we since we are concentrating on the younger group
7502	Kay .
7503	w wait a sec wait a se
7504	could you go to the previous slide ?
7505	because I am taking minutes
7506	were the important themes enclose .
7507	Oh wait wait up .
7508	Yeah
7509	okay .
7510	The feel of to be spongy
7511	Okay , so so , yeah ,
7512	it might not be t it
7513	it should not be too hard .
7514	so do you think when fruit and vegetables are important for clothing and shoes that they are in remote controls also ?
7515	Not something dull .
7516	Well ,
7517	one example given was this ,
7518	so
7519	I assume they just want something colourful .
7520	Not specifically an apple as a remote control or something .
7521	Okay .
7522	But they like dark colours ,
7523	you said in the p
7524	Okay .
7525	No , the younger group likes more colourful objects .
7526	Well
7527	then I suggest that
7528	the corporate colours are grey and yellow .
7529	But
7530	Which one ?
7531	This ?
7532	Yes .
7533	I had
7534	Or we could make oh .
7535	But can you can you go back to that slide ?
7536	The
7537	just one slide back , no no no .
7538	Yes .
7539	Okay ,
7540	and the feel of the material has to be spongy .
7541	Has it something to do with that natural feeling also , do you think ?
7542	Okay .
7543	well ,
7544	it might .
7545	But personally I would not like a sponge as a remote control .
7546	But
7547	Maybe soft material or something .
7548	But not a real sponge .
7549	It it
7550	maybe it rubber
7551	or or
7552	yeah .
7553	Yeah , exactly .
7554	Okay .
7555	Yeah ,
7556	and like the older group likes familiar materials , but that does not mean we should use wood ,
7557	So
7558	Well ,
7559	this this is an example of what they would like .
7560	But since we are conten concentrating on the younger group ,
7561	I think we should use soft materials and make it colourful or like cell phones , exch exchangeable covers .
7562	Yeah .
7563	So we could provide both for the young and the old what they like .
7564	Well ,
7565	that is interesting .
7566	It is quite interesting .
7567	You could make a few v very colourful ones , and a very traditional co cover .
7568	Yeah ,
7569	o o
7570	I am thinking about the Bananarama telephone telephone from Siemens .
7571	Yes .
7572	The yellow rubber telephone .
7573	Yeah ,
7574	yeah .
7575	It is the it is the rubber cover .
7576	Yeah , it is , it is i
7577	yeah .
7578	And it is colourful .
7579	It looks likes a banana .
7580	Yeah .
7581	We have the fruit , we have the colours .
7582	Do you know the phone ?
7583	It is the Siemens C twenty five , I believe it is it is the one the Post bank gave away ,
7584	the very
7585	You kn you know , Ruud , as well ?
7586	About th
7587	Okay .
7588	We have the simple design .
7589	I do not know the phone , but I can imagine it .
7590	thirty five .
7591	Oh , that one , yes .
7592	And the b
7593	the light blue and it is also in yellow .
7594	Now I kn
7595	oh , I know , I know .
7596	Yes ,
7597	I I have seen it .
7598	I have seen it .
7599	I have seen it ,
7600	but
7601	Kay .
7602	Okay .
7603	okay .
7604	Do you have thit that was
7605	Okay .
7606	that is about it .
7607	Okay , so
7608	the the m important findings are innovation is more important than ease of use for the our target group .
7609	Yes .
7610	And colouring is important and and soft materials .
7611	soft material .
7612	Okay .
7613	So So
7614	ease of use is important , but technology is twice as important .
7615	And what was even more important ?
7616	Okay .
7617	the fancy look and feel .
7618	So
7619	that is the most important thing for our customers .
7620	Yes .
7621	Apparently .
7622	Okay ,
7623	Roo ,
7624	could you do your presentation ?
7625	Okay , well
7626	it is good to to sum up the things we already thought about .
7627	Yeah .
7628	Well ,
7629	I do not ha really have much to add , because most of things we already said in the previous discussion .
7630	the previous ideas were voice recognition and the round button for the p channel programming and volume .
7631	Well ,
7632	a few interface I I found on the internet are are these .
7633	These are both with with voice recognition , but they are very advanced and very high tech and just , well , a weird shape .
7634	Shape .
7635	So I suggest I could not
7636	I had a small mock up sign on the on paper .
7637	But it did not work .
7638	My pen did not load the information .
7639	So I made a really simple f a shape on in PowerPoint .
7640	But we could make a round an oval remote control .
7641	But it is it is kind of it is kind of o organic ,
7642	so that is very good .
7643	yellow .
7644	Yeah .
7645	Yeah .
7646	And what I am thinking about , maybe we should make very light but a grip
7647	I mean this is how you hold a remote control .
7648	Yes .
7649	it should not be too glatt , too slippery ,
7650	s because
7651	Yeah .
7652	Slippery .
7653	But if you have something like the Siemens phone , it is rubber .
7654	You have to grab it .
7655	So it is easy in your hand indeed .
7656	Yeah , exactly .
7657	Yeah .
7658	Yes .
7659	There are there are also remote controls who have a little shape underneath where you can put your fingers in , so you can get a really good grip on it .
7660	Yeah , ex for your fingers , yeah .
7661	Yeah .
7662	So you you do not have to attain much pressure to it .
7663	It is it is a lot easier .
7664	Yeah .
7665	So
7666	m
7667	Yes .
7668	It grips automatically .
7669	Yeah ,
7670	okay .
7671	But I will I will go into that deeper in my presentation .
7672	Okay , good .
7673	Great .
7674	Oh and
7675	to add on Ruud is information ,
7676	in this interface we can have high tech with the voice recognition and , well , the the fancy colours and and so on , and still have the ease of use , because we have an easy interface .
7677	And all the other remote controls are high tech in buttons and and so on .
7678	Yeah .
7679	Way too much
7680	I think for our goal ,
7681	yeah .
7682	Yeah .
7683	So if you have the voice recognition , you can you can programme like thirty thirty c controls on it .
7684	Okay ,
7685	b
7686	but I think we will
7687	yeah .
7688	Okay ,
7689	but I will I will go into that ,
7690	because there are are some possibilities and some impossibilities .
7691	I had a talk with our manufacturing division , and we had a talk about all the different components who are in this design .
7692	these are the things we have looked at .
7693	And of course I used the web to find my information .
7694	About the casing , we have three different casing possibilities .
7695	We have the uncurved or flat case .
7696	that is the most common remote con control form we are used to is just a it ju
7697	it is just a box .
7698	I am sorry
7699	I
7700	I do not have any pictures of of this thing .
7701	We have a curved one .
7702	It is curved in two dimensions .
7703	You have to imagine it is a bit like a wave form .
7704	So it is a little more advanced in its in its shape .
7705	Okay .
7706	and we have an even more advanced shape , which is curved in three dimension .
7707	I c
7708	I think you can compare it a little bit with the big grey image you had in your presentation .
7709	Yeah .
7710	The the big remote control , something like that .
7711	Right .
7712	But it is quite advanced and it is it is quite daring to to use I think .
7713	for these casings we have different types of finishing .
7714	We can use plastic , which is very slippery and maybe not so nice , but you can give it any colour , which is the same for rubber , but it is not slippery .
7715	We can use wood and titanium .
7716	Well ,
7717	we cannot use the titanium on the double curve cases .
7718	And these latex cases , there is there is just the plastic ones wo not allow the use of solar cells as an energy source source .
7719	Which brings me to the different energy sources .
7720	well ,
7721	we even seem to have hand dyn dynamos for powering our remote controls .
7722	You really have to imagine like winding up your
7723	I d
7724	It would be very new ,
7725	but it is a kind of a retro style , I think .
7726	Great .
7727	Well ,
7728	it would be very new to the market ,
7729	but
7730	Yeah .
7731	Well ,
7732	this is quite interesting .
7733	there is there is also a kinetic energy supply .
7734	So
7735	when you are watching TV or when you are you you have to make some kind of energy kinetic energy by shaking the remote or throwing it against the wall , whatever you wish .
7736	Like the watch .
7737	It have it
7738	it has to move , that is the the sense of it .
7739	And you can store the energy in the in the thing .
7740	I think , if if I can hook on to that , the kinetic thing is very funny .
7741	It is very funny indeed .
7742	I mean solar is of course
7743	it is nice ,
7744	but it is , well , your your calculator has a solar panel .
7745	Indeed .
7746	hand dynamo
7747	Well ,
7748	maybe m
7749	Yeah , I know .
7750	But if you are watching a movie , how many times you take the the remote control and and
7751	if if you have a watch ,
7752	you have the kinetic idea in a watch also .
7753	You you walk
7754	and but
7755	you you are sitting on a couch .
7756	Yes .
7757	Yeah .
7758	But you know you know from your own watch your watch uses a minimal con it consumes a minimal amount of energy .
7759	the the shaking of your body , which is almost every activity makes your body shake , it charges it .
7760	But the problem here is that it it supplies a a very little amount of kinetic energy .
7761	So I think you have a problem when you are watching a movie
7762	and you have not moved the remote
7763	i remote control in a in an amount of time , and you want t to switch the channel or something ,
7764	well ,
7765	m
7766	it might not work .
7767	Yeah .
7768	And wha
7769	Okay .
7770	So that is something you have to keep in mind .
7771	So ,
7772	but maybe maybe there is a possibility com to combine it with m traditional batteries ,
7773	so we can save on the batteries
7774	and when there is enough kinet kinetic energy , use the kinetic energy , and otherwise use the batteries .
7775	Yeah .
7776	Okay ,
7777	because I guess the voice recognition feature u consumes quite a f a lot of power .
7778	yes , it does .
7779	Yeah .
7780	I will come to that later .
7781	Okay .
7782	And we of course have the traditional solar power , which is just a piece of material on the remote control which transfers light energy into electricity .
7783	The user interface controls , of course we have the push buttons and we also have scroll wheels .
7784	And these scroll wheels can also be integrated with buttons .
7785	So it is just like a mouse .
7786	You can scroll them , you can also push it .
7787	in the indicators we have the LCD displays , which means you can watch in a display w which channel you have chosen or something like that of the li amount of volume which is currently and we also have double scroll buttons , which are just two of these things .
7788	So we do not really have the the kind of button we had in mind in our in our last meeting , the the thing with the the round with the four
7789	Yes .
7790	Oh ,
7791	we can just make four push buttons in a form of a round .
7792	That is possible too .
7793	Yes .
7794	But I th I do not think
7795	the scroll wheels I had some
7796	I had some information about it too .
7797	I do not think there is any possibility for us to use scroll wheels .
7798	Well
7799	This will be the remote ,
7800	right ?
7801	with maybe a channel selector .
7802	I d
7803	I ca not see any scenario where you would use a scroll wheel with a button on it .
7804	Well ,
7805	mayb
7806	well ,
7807	m me neither .
7808	Maybe when you integrate some functions .
7809	Yeah .
7810	What about integrating a scroll bar on this side ?
7811	Because this is how you keep it Volume ?
7812	Well ,
7813	what about mute ?
7814	Thi i
7815	i
7816	m
7817	I guess th
7818	this is my volume button .
7819	Yeah , that is a possibility ,
7820	but
7821	But Flores , think about a scenario where y where you would use the scroll button for
7822	A
7823	volume , okay .
7824	it is do it is done before .
7825	Yes .
7826	It is quite quite good , yes .
7827	Well ,
7828	it is it
7829	well ,
7830	i
7831	what he means is there is an button integrated in the scroll wheel .
7832	There is no scenario where you use the button in the scroll wheel .
7833	You just use the wheel .
7834	About mute .
7835	Well ,
7836	yes .
7837	Okay .
7838	Yes .
7839	And I can either on this side or this side
7840	And click it to muten the device .
7841	Well ,
7842	okay .
7843	Well ,
7844	that that that is one possibility , okay .
7845	Well ,
7846	okay .
7847	And and it makes it different from the traditional devices on this market .
7848	It is quite goods .
7849	So
7850	I am looking for a way to make it a little different than the traditional ones .
7851	Yes .
7852	So maybe I guess that that is something you two need to think about .
7853	Yeah .
7854	Ruud , wha what do you thing about a scroll bar ?
7855	scroll wheel .
7856	well ,
7857	it is obvious obviously new .
7858	Wheel .
7859	So it might attract the young customers .
7860	Okay .
7861	But it is done before , there are many other devices like telephones and our radio , pocket radios .
7862	We use this .
7863	Yeah .
7864	And Well ,
7865	it is it is been done years ago
7866	and I do not see it anywhere now .
7867	So maybe it is not no .
7868	Well ,
7869	all the Sony telephones use it , for example , for volume .
7870	Nokia has a well , okay , it is not really a scroll wheel , but on their side th the the volume button is on the side , because you gri grab it like this .
7871	Yes ,
7872	but it uses two separate buttons .
7873	Yeah .
7874	I know , it is not really a scroll wheel .
7875	It does not use a .
7876	No .
7877	Yeah .
7878	Well .
7879	something for Roo here .
7880	For you too ,
7881	yeah .
7882	Yeah ,
7883	I believe if you have what we have earlier said , the grip places in in the remote control .
7884	You have your hand on one place on the remote control , so you have to place all the buttons in a range of your thumb .
7885	Wi within reach .
7886	Yes , you have to .
7887	So in that case the volume button on the side of the remote control would be perfect .
7888	Yes .
7889	yes .
7890	Yeah ,
7891	yeah .
7892	Okay .
7893	Okay .
7894	Sebastian .
7895	Yeah .
7896	Okay ,
7897	we have to know ,
7898	if you want to use these rubber double curved c case , you must use these push push buttons .
7899	There is no way you can integrate LCD displays .
7900	There is no way you can integrate scroll wheels , because it is all curved .
7901	There is there are no flat areas where you can incorporate these things .
7902	So that is a limitation .
7903	About the components , just the hardware .
7904	We basically have three types of chips we can use and these chips incorporate all the Logica and hardware that is needed to send to send a signal .
7905	we have a simple , regular and advanced chip .
7906	And there is something like a sample sensor and sample speaker , which is a little cryptic to me .
7907	But I think that is the the voice recognition thing that we are thinking about .
7908	Yeah yeah ,
7909	you can
7910	I have some information about it .
7911	in the voice recognition you say a word you can programme words like v volume up .
7912	Okay .
7913	Okay .
7914	So so
7915	okay .
7916	Of mute , let is say mute .
7917	you programme it , you m mute and you
7918	g you give an an action to it that that is really the mute function and when you speak in the the remote control , it repeats your saying .
7919	Yeah .
7920	So
7921	that is the sample sensor .
7922	Okay .
7923	So if you say mute , it says mute again , and then it is well ,
7924	I believe it is
7925	Yeah ,
7926	and then he he repeats its action what which he believes it is .
7927	It performs the action .
7928	Yeah .
7929	Okay .
7930	So you say mute , he repeats mute and you makes a computer sound mute , and then goes to the mute function .
7931	Yeah .
7932	Okay .
7933	Okay ,
7934	so that is basically the the voice recognition item we were searching for .
7935	Okay .
7936	This sample sensor requires an regular chip , I thought .
7937	no op I am not very sure .
7938	No , it is not in here .
7939	If we want to use the LCD display , we really need the advanced version , which is a bit l little bit more costly .
7940	If we want to use the scroll wheels we need the regular version .
7941	And if we do not want to use any of these more advanced functions we can keep with the simple chip , which is a bit cheaper .
7942	Okay .
7943	well
7944	d did we already decide on the display ?
7945	To
7946	No .
7947	Okay .
7948	no ,
7949	but I think that is something for Roo here to think about .
7950	Yeah .
7951	Well ,
7952	I do not have
7953	I have not looked for for information about it ,
7954	but I do not think information
7955	y I do not think you need it on a display .
7956	Especially when when we have to look at a cost , I do not think cause all any TV can can view a digit on on screen ,
7957	yeah .
7958	I I do not think either .
7959	No .
7960	I do not think you need it .
7961	On screen display .
7962	Yeah .
7963	Okay .
7964	Okay
7965	th
7966	Okay .
7967	Okay , well
7968	my conclusion , unfortunately the market has decided the a little other than I thought .
7969	I thought the market would like a sort m sort of titanium casing , but they seem to like natural stuff .
7970	So maybe we should think about wood finish .
7971	I have chosen the more battery with solar cell solution for the energy .
7972	It is more reliable , it is cheaper .
7973	So I do not think we should use the dynamo thing .
7974	Good .
7975	Kineti
7976	okay .
7977	The kinetic thing it it is it is a possibility .
7978	It is it is more advanced ,
7979	but I am
7980	I think you should combine it with batteries .
7981	Okay ,
7982	it is maybe a bit too too flashy ,
7983	too
7984	yeah .
7985	Otherwise it will not too advanced ,
7986	well .
7987	It is in in in some way it can give us an advance , because you will save on your batteries .
7988	But
7989	Yes .
7990	Yeah ,
7991	but that that is the same with the solar cell .
7992	That is no different .
7993	And I think it is more robust .
7994	It is more it is more functional .
7995	Yeah .
7996	Okay .
7997	But what about the markets wants colourfuls designs ?
7998	So if you use titanium
7999	Okay .
8000	No no ,
8001	but the that is what Sebastian said .
8002	The titanium thing we have to skip it .
8003	He said this is what this is my personal preference .
8004	But but yet , I understood that the market is different .
8005	Oh ,
8006	sorry .
8007	Yeah .
8008	So
8009	No ,
8010	r
8011	rubber with colours .
8012	So
8013	I think we should skip the titanium stuff , and we should use wood or something like that .
8014	Yeah .
8015	And
8016	yeah ,
8017	the
8018	yeah ,
8019	the older people liked wood .
8020	And I would think
8021	And they can be implemented with a regular chip ?
8022	Okay ,
8023	but we also
8024	we already need the regular chip for the sample sensor speaker
8025	oh ,
8026	evalu
8027	But most infrared remote controls do not have to be pointed at all .
8028	Oh okay ,
8029	sorry .
8030	So it it needs to be rubber .
8031	No the
8032	Yeah ,
8033	the younger people liked soft material .
8034	Colourful
8035	and
8036	Yeah .
8037	Okay .
8038	Okay , spongy materials .
8039	Yeah .
8040	Okay , well
8041	these scroll wheels , I think they they can be they can be handy .
8042	So
8043	Yes , they can .
8044	But they really need the regular chip , you cannot use the sa simple
8045	Well ,
8046	I am not very sure .
8047	Maybe that is an a different
8048	I think so , if you if you stick with the the simple straight forward not curve design , i it is too dull .
8049	But but do we want the curved design ,
8050	or I
8051	it is too dull .
8052	Yeah .
8053	Yeah .
8054	I do not think c our customers will like it .
8055	And if you take the double curved , then you cannot you can only use the rubber buttons and you cannot use the scroll wheels .
8056	Yeah .
8057	So I think this is the best of two worlds .
8058	Okay .
8059	Okay .
8060	Okay ,
8061	what about the issue I addressed at the beginning of the meeting ?
8062	the voice function w with the infrared issue .
8063	Yes .
8064	Because it it is of cour
8065	Yeah .
8066	It is it is I
8067	I can imagine it is very dull to talk to a device
8068	w if you have to point to another device .
8069	It is very unlogical .
8070	Well
8071	the
8072	there has to be some pointing at .
8073	Well
8074	It depends also on your on your
8075	Well ,
8076	it depends on your walls actually .
8077	But
8078	All lights get absorbed ,
8079	yeah .
8080	Well ,
8081	if you if you take your hand before it ,
8082	okay , it wo not work , but you can point it just to the other wall .
8083	If you have have smooth walls , it it
8084	it
8085	probably you are probably right .
8086	Yeah .
8087	But if you have carpets on the wall , which our natural loving friends probably do have , then yeah , th th it might be a bit more of a issue .
8088	Yes ,
8089	because the walls they they reflect the infrared light .
8090	So
8091	Yeah .
8092	So it has an
8093	it is easier .
8094	I suggest we use the the sensor sample .
8095	the sample sensor and sample speaker .
8096	with a with a regular chip .
8097	And the regular chip .
8098	I think it gives us the advantage of
8099	Yes , yes .
8100	And and the scroll scroll wheels .
8101	Yeah .
8102	I like the scroll wheels idea .
8103	And skip and skip the LCD part .
8104	Yeah .
8105	I do not think it it is any value added thing .
8106	No .
8107	So
8108	Okay .
8109	Think so too .
8110	Well ,
8111	it looks
8112	yeah , well
8113	according to Ruud , the the the market likes new flashy technology ,
8114	and I mean LCD is
8115	well ,
8116	ok I know ,
8117	but it is m
8118	it is
8119	less s standard
8120	than than
8121	Well ,
8122	we are not very w
8123	we do not know much about the the f the financial part .
8124	Technology .
8125	Yes .
8126	It is not very flashy and new .
8127	Standard ?
8128	Nah , n no , I do not think so .
8129	That is the problem .
8130	Because if we do have enough space in in our finance , I would say do integrate it ,
8131	because it it adds a little ext extra high tech feeling to it .
8132	Yes .
8133	But we already have the scroll wheels , the sp the speaker the speak recognition , the rubber , the fancy colours .
8134	yeah .
8135	I think our customers will go insane .
8136	Okay , okay .
8137	It is it is too much .
8138	Yeah .
8139	Okay , I I agree .
8140	I think i
8141	Ruud , do you have any anything you would like to add or or maybe thoughts
8142	or
8143	No ?
8144	Sebast
8145	nee ,
8146	Roo ?
8147	Roo , do you have any other
8148	Nothing more .
8149	M
8150	no .
8151	Nothing more .
8152	Sebas
8153	Well ,
8154	we we need to describe decisions now .
8155	Okay .
8156	the n the next phase will be the not the
8157	what is the next phase
8158	f Flores ?
8159	Okay .
8160	So
8161	on the energy , well , we decided .
8162	So i
8163	Okay .
8164	Chip .
8165	Okay .
8166	The case rubber with c one one one curve .
8167	Okay , okay .
8168	User interface
8169	then the corporate identity should be in the product .
8170	but ca not scroll wheels work with one one curved case ?
8171	Yeah , okay .
8172	Yes , they can work .
8173	Sorry ,
8174	yeah .
8175	They cannot work with double curved .
8176	Oh ,
8177	sorry .
8178	That is that is problem .
8179	Yeah .
8180	I will check it for you .
8181	I guess that is something for Roo and Sebastian .
8182	you talked about it before , the colours , grey and yellow .
8183	Yeah .
8184	Keep it in mind .
8185	And the buttons , well we talked about it now .
8186	The next phase , Sebastian , is the design of the look and feel .
8187	Yes .
8188	The user interface design .
8189	And for you , the product evaluation .
8190	I am sure your personal coach will give you more information on that .
8191	and the ID and the UID need to work together on the prototype drawing on the SMARTboard .
8192	Okay .
8193	And I am going to plan my holidays .
8194	Okay .
8195	So you will be on the Bahamas .
8196	The project drawing is for the next
8197	Yeah , right .
8198	Okay .
8199	Yeah ,
8200	it is it is
8201	when we come back in thirty minutes , you will have a prototype ready .
8202	So
8203	can you give us a summary of all decisions we have made ?
8204	I will do .
8205	Yeah ?
8206	I can .
8207	maybe one of you could write it down .
8208	Great .
8209	you you need to help me .
8210	The casing is curved , single curved .
8211	Okay .
8212	W
8213	start with the casing .
8214	Single curved .
8215	Okay , single curved case .
8216	Okay .
8217	What about the energy source ?
8218	I I think they can .
8219	Traditional batteries and solar .
8220	But can there be wor can they work together ?
8221	Or do we have to choose between them ?
8222	Cause if we have to choose
8223	yeah ?
8224	Okay .
8225	No , they can be complementary .
8226	al al I
8227	Every device
8228	Yeah .
8229	Yes .
8230	Well ,
8231	It it should be .
8232	What if not ?
8233	Okay .
8234	There should be really no problem .
8235	They can be supplementary .
8236	That is no problem .
8237	So
8238	So
8239	just the energy source is the batteries and the solar .
8240	Okay ,
8241	th
8242	Battery and solar , yeah .
8243	Okay .
8244	What about the finishing of the case ?
8245	We have decided we wanted to use the rubber ?
8246	Okay ,
8247	and I think we should use the company colours .
8248	Yeah , with colourful rubber .
8249	Yeah .
8250	if it is possible with different covers , but I am not sure if our suppliers can can help us with with such a wish .
8251	Something like black and red .
8252	black and yellow .
8253	grey and yellow or black and yellow .
8254	Grey and yellow .
8255	Grey yellow , okay .
8256	Yeah .
8257	Yellow case and grey buttons , I think .
8258	Yeah , although I do not think that is very colourful .
8259	Except for the yellow of course ,
8260	but I could think of a more attractive c set of colours .
8261	Oh ,
8262	I think it is it is not very dull .
8263	It is quite modern actually .
8264	Do not you think ?
8265	Well ,
8266	I was more thinking about the fruit colours that the Ruud showed us before .
8267	I believe the But you have already
8268	you must have a red on and off button .
8269	And
8270	Well well Well ,
8271	there is .
8272	Well ,
8273	it it does not have to be red .
8274	I mean th
8275	I think these colours are really what our young people are looking for .
8276	so maybe it should not even be two colours ,
8277	it should be a full colour cover with such an image
8278	or or
8279	I mean thinking in two colours is is too black and white for our m c market group , I guess .
8280	Okay .
8281	Or black and yellow .
8282	Black and yellow , yeah .
8283	Okay ,
8284	but I am afraid it is not possible to print a picture on the device .
8285	Because I agree it would be nice to have have something like that on the device itself .
8286	But
8287	Oh ,
8288	I have read .
8289	Just a week ago , a keyboard manufacturer would print ,
8290	with and
8291	No .
8292	Yeah .
8293	Yes .
8294	Yes ,
8295	but our manufacturing department is not so advanced in its techniques .
8296	They are actually very slow in its techniques .
8297	Okay ,
8298	so we have to deal with wh what is possible here .
8299	So So I am afraid it is not possible .
8300	Yeah .
8301	Okay .
8302	more f more more decisions we made .
8303	The scroll heel .
8304	A scroll wheel .
8305	Yes ,
8306	the voice recognition we already decided .
8307	Voice recognition , of course .
8308	Okay , so
8309	scroll wheel .
8310	But there will be some additional buttons , I guess .
8311	Yeah .
8312	And th the they should be spongy also ,
8313	because they are they are rubber too .
8314	I am going to leave that up to you two .
8315	What what did you say ?
8316	Yeah .
8317	Well
8318	you can use
8319	well ,
8320	when you use the buttons , they will they will be made of rubber too .
8321	So it has th the spongy feel also .
8322	Yeah .
8323	Yeah ,
8324	or you could use plastic buttons .
8325	In the rubber .
8326	I think rubber is nice .
8327	Because it
8328	i
8329	I mean what do you touch
8330	the button ,
8331	and what do they want
8332	spongy devices ,
8333	or or i .
8334	Yeah ,
8335	b
8336	But then you just have the the fact that the drawings on the buttons will disappear eventually .
8337	What I said in the in the first discussion , the digit six on the button , it will disappear when it is from rubber .
8338	is that
8339	does our our supplier say so ?
8340	Yeah .
8341	It is not something
8342	it is no information I read about it or so ,
8343	but it is just from
8344	No ,
8345	but but it
8346	Yeah , b yeah .
8347	did not did we inc include the digi digits or leave them to the speech recognition ?
8348	Cause things like volume could be placed next to the button .
8349	You could place a
8350	this this would be the button .
8351	There the icons .
8352	The scroll wheel , I mean .
8353	And you could place the indica th th the signals the
8354	No no , there is no painting ,
8355	only yellow or
8356	But it is into the rubber .
8357	Yes .
8358	That is okay .
8359	Yeah , that is possible ,
8360	but then you have still the images on the rubber of the case .
8361	So still then , if you feel li if you feel your remote control , you just rub on the cover , so you rub on the painting .
8362	Yeah .
8363	Yeah ,
8364	but but the the plus or the minus .
8365	Yes , the signs .
8366	You have to draw the
8367	Yeah ,
8368	it is on the cover .
8369	Yeah ,
8370	but this is on the pla
8371	yeah , I know .
8372	I think I know which you understand
8373	af
8374	I know what you mean .
8375	So if you
8376	You just move the problem .
8377	What about making this rubber and making this plastic ?
8378	Yeah .
8379	I see what you mean .
8380	Well ,
8381	maybe that is possible ,
8382	because our manufacturing division also offers plastic finishing .
8383	So maybe they can combine these two .
8384	Well actually ,
8385	we should have it the other way around , I guess .
8386	A plastic cover with rubber finishing .
8387	I mean , this is this is the finishing .
8388	This is what is on the edge .
8389	What you feel .
8390	Yeah .
8391	But the front , on which the the buttons are does not have to be rubber .
8392	I mean
8393	I know ,
8394	but do you touch this or do you touch this ?
8395	I mean , I I never touch between the buttons .
8396	Well ,
8397	I am I am not so sure ,
8398	I think it c should be
8399	Well ,
8400	I am not sure ,
8401	I have to ask with manufacturing ,
8402	but I am I am not sure that is what you want ,
8403	because our customers specifically ask for the spongy feel , and that is what you get with rubber .
8404	Y
8405	can you separate these these
8406	I do .
8407	So if you want the spongy feel , you need to make these buttons all all of rubber .
8408	I think both .
8409	I do .
8410	Or the s the sideways .
8411	I think
8412	Okay .
8413	Or the the back .
8414	Yeah , the side , exactly , the sideways .
8415	Or the back .
8416	The side ,
8417	but do you touch between the the these buttons ?
8418	Okay .
8419	I think
8420	Yes , especially when there are l a few buttons on it , you have a lot of space to touch .
8421	So you just have it in your hand completely or or i you play with it .
8422	Well ,
8423	we do not have very much time left .
8424	I guess you two have to figure that out .
8425	Yeah .
8426	I am going to leave the decision to you ,
8427	because you have to make its prototype ,
8428	and yeah
8429	y
8430	you have the most knowledge about the suppliers , the possibilities
8431	and
8432	so I am going to leave it the decision with you .
8433	Yeah .
8434	Sebastian , did you write enough decisions down ?
8435	Yeah .
8436	not quite .
8437	what about the chips ?
8438	We use the regular chip ?
8439	Okay .
8440	Regular .
8441	And
8442	Well
8443	no , I think that is about it .
8444	Use with .
8445	Yes .
8446	Okay .
8447	With those regular chips we can still control advanced functions .
8448	The chip is is not really
8449	Okay , well .
8450	The only difference between the advanced and the regular version is that the advanced version of the chip supports LCD .
8451	That is all .
8452	And we have decided not to use LCD .
8453	Yeah .
8454	So
8455	Okay .
8456	Okay .
8457	okay ,
8458	then I think we are quite finished .
8459	I will see you guys in thirty minutes
8460	and
8461	Yeah ?
8462	Yeah ,
8463	if you write wrote anything down ,
8464	could you put it on the shared folder ?
8465	Yeah .
8466	For the finishing touch .
8467	Okay .
8468	yeah .
8469	I know ,
8470	but
8471	well
8472	Great .
8473	 
8474	That is the same as on the top of it with the the round button .
8475	Like this one .
8476	But we do not we do not
8477	we do think it is well
8478	what if with ease of use , w which prefers the which the the customer of the user prefers .
8479	It is important .
8480	I think th this is device which which has a learning curve .
8481	novice users u use this device as normal users use a c a remote control .
8482	And after a while they start to develop some skills in the the voice recognition functions , and then they will not use this dial as often .
8483	But other users who are new to this device need something like that .
8484	Okay .
8485	They n they need to understand what how to change channels and change the volume , so it is easier for them
8486	Yeah , maybe so .
8487	Could could I see the scroll bar as as as a sort of shortcut ?
8488	A a and the voice recognition as well ,
8489	th maybe you could could
8490	Yeah .
8491	Yes ,
8492	it is
8493	Well ,
8494	it is it is it is another approach ,
8495	it is more that our .
8496	There are there are many ways of doing things on such a device .
8497	It is it is quite easy .
8498	Okay .
8499	Okay ,
8500	good .
8501	And and the case is is rubber ?
8502	And the buttons ?
8503	Okay ,
8504	and the colouring ?
8505	with with grey or black .
8506	Yes , rubber ?
8507	There are plastic or rubber .
8508	Plastic or rubber .
8509	Well ,
8510	yeah .
8511	yellow with
8512	grey or black or something like that .
8513	Whatever cost cost the least .
8514	Okay ,
8515	we will we will come to that later .
8516	okay .
8517	Anything else to add
8518	or
8519	Yeah .
8520	No .
8521	maybe we should think about these buttons .
8522	Well ,
8523	you could use two of them to programme the channels on the two channel button ,
8524	cause you have to assign two channel new channels .
8525	But
8526	Yes ,
8527	but it
8528	but these are tasks that are only executed once , I think .
8529	M
8530	yeah .
8531	Or not ?
8532	Well
8533	okay .
8534	M m
8535	but maybe you do want a programme button to for example activate the voice recognition , or train the voice voice recognition .
8536	You
8537	Yes .
8538	Okay ,
8539	yeah , that is right .
8540	Or something li like that .
8541	And a button for disabling the voice recognition .
8542	Yeah
8543	al although by pressing the button for I n do not know two , three seconds , you could also say it you would disable it with a little beep and and
8544	but o okay ,
8545	that that is not really really important .
8546	Yes .
8547	Yeah .
8548	That is the basic idea , yeah .
8549	The basic
8550	okay .
8551	Of our prototype .
8552	Okay .
8553	you thought of some evaluation crit criteria ?
8554	Okay .
8555	my name is not name
8556	but
8557	well ,
8558	I used the the documents .
8559	You are nameless .
8560	And these were the most important criteria .
8561	It should be .
8562	yeah ,
8563	that is how the fashion guys state it .
8564	Is it spongy ?
8565	I believe it is fancy too .
8566	Fancy look and feel .
8567	So
8568	well
8569	appar
8570	Yeah ,
8571	but apparently we should not evaluate yet .
8572	So
8573	just walk through it step by step .
8574	I mean , is it fancy ,
8575	everything I believe
8576	I believe it is fancy .
8577	No .
8578	Oh ,
8579	sorry .
8580	So
8581	Yeah , I think these are the most important criteria .
8582	Okay .
8583	Okay , so
8584	this
8585	these are the cr the criteria .
8586	Okay , well
8587	the then we will switch to my presentation .
8588	So
8589	that is about it .
8590	The production costs .
8591	The costs are not under Can I this is the
8592	Yeah ,
8593	it is it is w way above above the the the twelve Euro fifty .
8594	Twenty two .
8595	Yikes .
8596	And what makes it very expensive is for example the solar cell .
8597	Well
8598	it is very expensive .
8599	So I guess we should skip that ,
8600	because it is not that important .
8601	Okay .
8602	Why does the price and and the s
8603	oh ,
8604	one exa
8605	yeah .
8606	Yeah ,
8607	the the price , the the number of items and the the sum .
8608	The number of
8609	yeah .
8610	Okay .
8611	well ,
8612	this is what I would call our luxury model .
8613	if you would
8614	if you look at the w w w what we could do to make it more to make it just between the twelve Euro fifty , then I did the following changes .
8615	And and does it
8616	But that is that is only for the buttons .
8617	Twelve Euro forty cents I came up with by leaving out the solar cells , by not using the voice recognition feature ,
8618	because it is it is a four Euro addition to the price .
8619	Yeah ,
8620	I believe , push button ,
8621	well
8622	It makes it the thirteen
8623	yeah .
8624	Push buttons are buttons are are not the most expensive , but do add extra cost .
8625	So yeah ,
8626	th this design is not within our price model .
8627	Okay .
8628	Yeah .
8629	But I am afraid it is not complete .
8630	Because we use spec specic special materials , the last item .
8631	And you have not added one item there .
8632	So it is c way too expensive .
8633	It is still too expensive , yeah .
8634	I I guess if we leave the if we leave this one out ,
8635	oh .
8636	So the button we can use plastic .
8637	And maybe not use the special form .
8638	And the pla
8639	And a plastic b just plastic buttons , a plas instead of rubber .
8640	But it
8641	Yes .
8642	It becomes a very dull remote control , I know .
8643	But it is the board decision .
8644	And
8645	yeah .
8646	Well , b basically
8647	it
8648	when when this is our only option , we should even consider changing the casing ,
8649	because I think there is very little added value in an enhanced case with these dull functions .
8650	Yeah .
8651	Yeah , I know .
8652	So
8653	Type of m maybe another market segment .
8654	Maybe we should look at an focus on another
8655	Yeah ,
8656	m
8657	maybe not not all that fancy , but just way way more easy basic and m maximise the profits
8658	and
8659	Yeah .
8660	Yeah .
8661	Yes .
8662	That is maybe that is better .
8663	Maybe we could we should go for straight and simple ,
8664	but that is not what has been asked .
8665	Yeah .
8666	I know , I know .
8667	So
8668	we should kick the board is
8669	Well
8670	Yeah .
8671	Although I think we yeah , but we could still make a remote control that ap applies more to young people
8672	by giving it another colour already .
8673	so
8674	it is possible to make a device that attracts a little bit more to young people .
8675	Yes .
8676	but I agree it is it is not a fancy high tech device .
8677	Definitely not , no .
8678	It is not that innovative .
8679	Or however you s pronounce that .
8680	so , okay .
8681	Yeah , too bad .
8682	Oh ,
8683	this is the wrong one .
8684	So
8685	that means redesign .
8686	We do not have the time o now to to redesign the product .
8687	but we can evaluate the process and the satisfaction on how things went .
8688	I am not sure if we need to evaluate the device first .
8689	I guess
8690	Yeah .
8691	well ,
8692	since we are not going to manufacture it anyway
8693	Yay .
8694	Yeah , that is true .
8695	Well ,
8696	maybe it is good to do it anyway ,
8697	because if we evaluate it , we we can also determine if our objectives are good .
8698	We l we can learn .
8699	Yeah .
8700	Yeah .
8701	So
8702	Is it fancy ?
8703	I think so .
8704	I agree .
8705	Well
8706	I d
8707	it is it is
8708	Yeah , I think so .
8709	Is it ?
8710	Is it fancy ?
8711	So
8712	one ?
8713	Is it And w
8714	yeah ,
8715	w what they want wanted was colours and soft materials .
8716	the yellow rubber , I think so .
8717	You like the rubber , Roo .
8718	I am into it .
8719	But it is not that fancy .
8720	Yeah .
8721	No , I will I will I will give it a two .
8722	I mean
8723	I think I think it would have been more fancy if we used the titanium housing the casing .
8724	It would be even more
8725	oh , you really like titanium .
8726	You like tita
8727	That is a flavour as well .
8728	I am I am into it .
8729	It has flavour .
8730	Yes , that is right .
8731	You should taste it .
8732	Right .
8733	Yeah , I know ,
8734	but but it but that is fancy in the way
8735	I mean fancy has has a lot of
8736	Yeah .
8737	It has to do with fashion , I guess .
8738	So
8739	do
8740	Okay .
8741	It is trendy trendy , fun
8742	yeah .
8743	So in that way It it is fancy .
8744	Yeah .
8745	It applies .
8746	It
8747	yeah .
8748	Well ,
8749	just give it a two .
8750	Yeah .
8751	Yes .
8752	I think I th
8753	I think it would have been
8754	I would have think
8755	it could have been more fancy by using the double curved case .
8756	It is not the ultimate fancy two , but
8757	Yeah ,
8758	but that is sti that is
8759	Looking at the user needs , we only do not we do not have the double curved case .
8760	It would have been even more fancy ,
8761	but we decided not to , because if we use a double curved case , we could not use solar .
8762	So
8763	Yes .
8764	We w we do have the rubber , we do have the colours .
8765	That is two out of three .
8766	So I believe we are close to two .
8767	Yeah , I I agree .
8768	Yes , I agree too .
8769	It is okay .
8770	We did
8771	yes ,
8772	we did good .
8773	Okay , and
8774	was it innovative ?
8775	Yep .
8776	Well ,
8777	with the voice recognition feature
8778	and
8779	No ,
8780	we are evaluating this this design now .
8781	But that is not in it .
8782	Ov or can we
8783	Okay .
8784	Well ,
8785	let is let is this product .
8786	So I I
8787	I think it is .
8788	This prototype .
8789	I think it is innovative .
8790	Yeah .
8791	And the scroll wheel .
8792	The solar not many remotes have the solar , I think .
8793	No .
8794	It could have been a little bit more innovative u by using the kinetic energy source ,
8795	but it is it is way too
8796	yes ,
8797	but
8798	I think it is a two .
8799	Yeah , and So
8800	also a two ?
8801	Is it easy to use ?
8802	Well
8803	the p
8804	the most important function is easy to use .
8805	That would have been a thrill .
8806	Yep .
8807	I am not sure .
8808	Yeah .
8809	I am not sure .
8810	Well yeah ,
8811	the voice recognition of course is hard to learn , I think .
8812	Well ,
8813	hard
8814	it is not for the for the e for the elderly .
8815	Well ,
8816	but there are two parts in this remote control .
8817	They wo not use it .
8818	What you see here is is the basic part .
8819	Everybody can use it ,
8820	so that is easy to use .
8821	Yeah .
8822	That is for a novice user .
8823	When you have a more advanced , elaborate user , well , such a user really would like to explore all these additional functions .
8824	So in that in that way it is advanced ,
8825	and I think it is easy to use for for both types of users .
8826	Yeah .
8827	So
8828	It is maybe it is not very easy for
8829	Okay .
8830	I think I think a three .
8831	Would not give it more .
8832	I am doubting doubting as well .
8833	The the zapping , channel switching , volume .
8834	But the more advanced functions are probably a bit harder .
8835	Okay .
8836	two or three ?
8837	Three ?
8838	Wha wh what would be your guess ?
8839	I mean ease of use does not only apply to the most basic functions .
8840	It is the it is it is overall .
8841	Is the device easy to use ?
8842	Yeah .
8843	Yeah , that is right .
8844	You are right in that ,
8845	but I I guess an advanced user will will find the voice recognition function easy to use , because he is already he or she is already an advanced user .
8846	Yeah .
8847	So
8848	After all , I think personally I would give a two .
8849	Okay .
8850	But
8851	So , it is two , two and three .
8852	Roo , a three ?
8853	Ruud ?
8854	Okay .
8855	Yep .
8856	Good question .
8857	I will go for the two .
8858	Two threes .
8859	So that is ten .
8860	So
8861	I could make it e easy ?
8862	Roo .
8863	If you make it a four it will be three in general .
8864	So that is w
8865	No ,
8866	two and a half .
8867	If he makes it a four .
8868	Six and four .
8869	Not a three .
8870	Six and four is ten .
8871	Divided by four is two and a half .
8872	So
8873	Yes .
8874	Darn .
8875	Nee .
8876	Huh ?
8877	Yeah .
8878	A seven , a three
8879	No .
8880	A four and a three together .
8881	I yeah .
8882	Four ?
8883	Two ?
8884	Divided by four .
8885	Yeah , you have a two , he has a two .
8886	Yeah , two , two , three
8887	No .
8888	Three ?
8889	And a three ?
8890	Nee .
8891	No ,
8892	I have not said anything yet .
8893	I know .
8894	Okay ,
8895	but if I would say a three , then it is six , and four is ten .
8896	Divided by four is two point five .
8897	Yes .
8898	So if you want to have the conclusion as a three three .
8899	Then you would make a four .
8900	If you fill out a four
8901	Yeah ,
8902	we have not re re really worked it out ,
8903	but you c you can you can just say find and he repeats find .
8904	That is not even
8905	But that is not possible to fill in ,
8906	so we have to round it .
8907	But I am filling in a three .
8908	Does it will
8909	so it will be a two point five .
8910	Yes , it is .
8911	I have a veto .
8912	Exactly .
8913	It is not about the content ,
8914	it is about
8915	okay ,
8916	is it easy to f
8917	Yeah , definitely .
8918	Is it easy to find ?
8919	Yeah , I agree .
8920	Yes .
8921	It it most definitely is it is very easy .
8922	Yeah ,
8923	or beeps
8924	or
8925	yeah .
8926	Yeah ,
8927	but that is the that is the the basic idea of the the speaker
8928	But even without it
8929	Yeah .
8930	Yes .
8931	Maybe I
8932	I think I think
8933	something like that .
8934	I am here , I am here .
8935	Maybe you have to programme it once , so to that l respond to a certain word or a certain sentence , something like where are you ,
8936	and then it will sing I am here .
8937	Yeah .
8938	Yeah .
8939	Yeah .
8940	So something like that .
8941	So ,
8942	I th
8943	Yeah , me too .
8944	Well , I
8945	we should not stay too long on this subject because of the time ,
8946	but I personally give it a one .
8947	Sebastian ?
8948	Right , well .
8949	Me too .
8950	The feel of the remote control is spongy .
8951	Well ,
8952	it ca not be more spongy .
8953	So
8954	No okay ,
8955	but but
8956	for the options given , it is the most spongy one .
8957	Well ,
8958	it can be .
8959	There are cases in which the outside casing is can be how d how do you prono is is moldable .
8960	Was it one of our options ?
8961	So , in the in
8962	Yeah .
8963	No , it is not one of our option ,
8964	but when you look in the market , when you look
8965	yes ,
8966	but that is not that is not what they are talking about , I think .
8967	No .
8968	this this was a most spongy option .
8969	Because we compare all these characteristics characteristics with market with with the real market .
8970	Yeah .
8971	So
8972	there are remote controls out there which are a lot more spongy .
8973	Yeah .
8974	They are out there .
8975	They are out there .
8976	But I think in this case in this case we have done the best we could .
8977	Yes , but it is not good enough , so it is a two .
8978	Yeah .
8979	I will give it a one .
8980	I wan
8981	I will take one .
8982	You take one ?
8983	What do you give it ?
8984	No no no .
8985	Well yeah ,
8986	it depends ,
8987	cause it is the most spongy we could
8988	but
8989	yeah .
8990	Yeah , I know ,
8991	but you have to name a fig a number .
8992	Because we need to go on in for the time .
8993	Well ,
8994	if I give it a one there will be one hell of a calculation .
8995	It will be a one .
8996	So I will just give it a two
8997	and make this a one point five .
8998	I will I will change it ,
8999	I will make it m
9000	my my mark will be a four .
9001	You are
9002	okay .
9003	The remote control offers enough features .
9004	Well ,
9005	Ruud , what what do you think about it ?
9006	Yeah .
9007	Well ,
9008	the basic layout does not offem offer much , but the voice recognition could add a lot .
9009	So
9010	Yeah ,
9011	depends .
9012	Basically it is it is completely programmable .
9013	You can add very m much functionality by using the voice recognition mode .
9014	Yeah , I know .
9015	So it is quite advanced .
9016	What what we did not talk about is
9017	I think it has .
9018	Yeah ,
9019	but it ha does not has the digits .
9020	I believe it is
9021	If you ask yourself it offers enough features , I do not I do not think it is it has all the features a normal remote has .
9022	depends on what you implement in the speech feat
9023	Signal .
9024	Yeah .
9025	Bec because you can
9026	we did not talk about it , but you do have remote controls that are able to adapt another signal .
9027	Yes .
9028	So ,
9029	you place a a regular remote control in front of the other one , hit the one or the two or the three , whatever , and it r records the the the the signals .
9030	Has the signals sent to it .
9031	Yeah .
9032	So you could enter any comment you like , as long it is able to as long as our device is able to reproduce the infrared signal .
9033	So I think th this this is a a remote control with a very high level of features .
9034	Absolutely .
9035	Although there are i a few buttons , but the inside is is quite advanced .
9036	Yes .
9037	But that that is its power , I guess , because a regular programmable remote control contains , well , really a lot of buttons .
9038	Yeah .
9039	At at least forty buttons .
9040	Yeah .
9041	So it is it is quite s complicated to get to get used to .
9042	And this is quite s simple .
9043	You can use your voice to to programme it .
9044	Yep .
9045	It is
9046	Yeah , I will give it a one .
9047	Yeah .
9048	Okay ,
9049	let is give it a number .
9050	I will give it a one .
9051	For for the for this t type of market , I think it is a one .
9052	I will give a two .
9053	I think think a one ,
9054	cause v with a voice recognition you could add anything you want ,
9055	so that is like
9056	Maybe even because it does not look advanced .
9057	Yes .
9058	I I have I think we have succe succeed in in developing a product that is actually quite good , but not for this kind of market , and not for this kind of price .
9059	So
9060	Yeah .
9061	So high quality , low acceptance .
9062	The product is is is b high qua has a high quality and and is advanced .
9063	Yes .
9064	But whether or not our clients are are willing to pay twenty five Euros for this kind of device is doub is well , is not sure .
9065	D do you agree ?
9066	Yeah .
9067	Yes , I agree .
9068	I
9069	Yeah , okay .
9070	Maybe we should have a radar function .
9071	But
9072	Yes .
9073	But we could could not what
9074	what is the selling price ?
9075	Fifty ?
9076	twenty five .
9077	Twenty five Euros .
9078	And costs were twelve fifty .
9079	Yeah .
9080	But even now , if only our production costs w were exceeded the double ,
9081	Think .
9082	Production cost was were t was twenty two ?
9083	So
9084	selling price would be
9085	yeah .
9086	M about fifty Euros .
9087	That is quite ex
9088	well ,
9089	it is not it is not very expensive for a remote control that that has this functionality .
9090	That is price , but w w
9091	No .
9092	An original remote control of any TV kind , a Phillips remote control , y you pay
9093	Yeah ,
9094	I kn I know from a few years ago , it it it costed hundred Gilders .
9095	Yes ,
9096	it is more than fifty Euros .
9097	It is quite expensive , yes .
9098	Bu but well
9099	yeah , I know ,
9100	but you are paying for th for the brand , because there are remote controls which control your stereo , television , DVD , CD player , for under twenty five Euros .
9101	Yes .
9102	Yes ,
9103	but you can you c
9104	Yes ,
9105	but you can learn this thing , all these functions .
9106	And it is easier to use because those remote controls do not offer voice recognition and this one does .
9107	Yeah .
9108	Yeah .
9109	So I think it is worth its price .
9110	Okay .
9111	you had an overall rating .
9112	That is counting .
9113	Yeah ,
9114	but with these ratings
9115	should be about one point s seven ,
9116	yeah .
9117	Well ,
9118	it is it is about one point five .
9119	Four six seven eight .
9120	Something like that .
9121	Okay .
9122	Nine divided by six .
9123	Okay .
9124	we will go further on with the the rest of the evaluation .
9125	About the project itself , not about the product .
9126	What did you think about the process , the project process ?
9127	Ruud ?
9128	Try to translate that .
9129	Well Well ,
9130	I think
9131	Any any other
9132	, Roo ?
9133	Roo .
9134	Yeah ,
9135	I think
9136	The process was good .
9137	The prices .
9138	But w we were not aware of the prices of the costs .
9139	Yeah .
9140	And and that was the the big deal .
9141	I if we knew that before , we c we could have made
9142	the the choice between what
9143	yeah .
9144	Actually ,
9145	we had
9146	Yes .
9147	Better decision .
9148	We had we had too little information actually .
9149	Yeah .
9150	So And
9151	the the the
9152	well ,
9153	looking at room for creativity , there was w way too the the choice of components was way too narrow .
9154	Less .
9155	So there was not really a process of
9156	Well
9157	Yes .
9158	Yeah .
9159	So we could we we could be we could have been creative .
9160	But it was tempered by the choice of components and the the price .
9161	Well ,
9162	in the first meeting we we already were very creative .
9163	We we thought of possibilities who are not possible with the the current offer of manufacturing components .
9164	Yeah .
9165	So
9166	We are tempered by that , yes .
9167	Yeah .
9168	Okay ,
9169	Roo ?
9170	Any other thoughts on that ?
9171	Ruud ?
9172	You agree , okay .
9173	No , no .
9174	I agree .
9175	leadership .
9176	Fantastic .
9177	Okay , Roo is on for his promotion .
9178	Yeah , okay .
9179	Okay .
9180	I think we are a good team .
9181	I think so too ,
9182	it is it is it is of course a laboratory environment .
9183	I missed it to be able to contact you in between and say , hey Roo .
9184	Yes .
9185	Yeah .
9186	Yeah .
9187	Well ,
9188	I tried once , but that was not allowed .
9189	So Yeah ,
9190	but but si w w w
9191	when taken in account the the situation , I think we performed pretty well .
9192	I think so too .
9193	Yeah .
9194	Yeah .
9195	the means , the SMARTboard , the digital pen .
9196	Did you like them ?
9197	Because of the response
9198	or
9199	Okay .
9200	The digital pen was okay , but SMARTboard was really bad .
9201	Yeah .
9202	It it is
9203	The response is very slow and the possibilities are very limited .
9204	Response
9205	and it it has
9206	yeah .
9207	It is not accurate .
9208	Okay , so
9209	it it had to be better aligned , or what is the word ?
9210	yeah .
9211	Yeah , it is not accurate .
9212	The p the pointing of the pen is not the place where it it writes
9213	its where it
9214	Yeah , where it draws .
9215	Draws .
9216	It is
9217	the drawing on on the b on the board is r right from the pen .
9218	So
9219	You to take in account that your you m
9220	yeah
9221	It is too slow
9222	Maybe it is it needs to be calibrateds .
9223	It it was calibrated just before this meeting .
9224	the one before , the third meeting .
9225	It is ?
9226	Okay .
9227	So it is not the calibration , it is the thing itself , I think .
9228	Okay .
9229	Ruud , w did you use the pen a lot ?
9230	Or not at all ?
9231	Not at all .
9232	No .
9233	Not really .
9234	Okay .
9235	I thought it was quite a handy thing ,
9236	although I would like to see OCR .
9237	I I think so too .
9238	Yes .
9239	Yep .
9240	Yes .
9241	If it has OCR , I think I would use , but I I just took notes for myself and
9242	and and that is it .
9243	Yeah .
9244	It w it w
9245	yeah .
9246	It was necessary for me to
9247	Yeah ,
9248	because if I want something on the computer , I just type it .
9249	To digitise them .
9250	Yeah .
9251	I type faster than I write .
9252	So
9253	Economic .
9254	Yeah .
9255	But I think it is a great solution for for a known problem , writing down some notes , some some inf information , and then forgetting your notebook somewhere and losing all that information .
9256	Yeah .
9257	Because you have everything in one place
9258	and it is quite easy quite easy
9259	it is it is possible to make this information digital and share it with others in a quite easy way .
9260	Yeah .
9261	I think it is a good product .
9262	I only think it is th the the shape of the pen is too big .
9263	Yeah .
9264	It is not quite ergonomic .
9265	Eco ergonomic .
9266	I know .
9267	Yeah .
9268	Okay .
9269	What w
9270	Ruud , what did you think about the SMARTboards ?
9271	Yeah .
9272	Oh ,
9273	I only use it to draw a rabbit ,
9274	so ca not say much about it .
9275	Okay , you ca not really decide .
9276	No .
9277	I missed a feature to easily select a slide and distribute it to the laptops .
9278	I think that would be very easy if you could say okay
9279	, I want to use this for my own work or my own presentation further on
9280	or
9281	Or the other way around ,
9282	that you could show but m
9283	I know .
9284	Yes .
9285	No ,
9286	or the other way around .
9287	Yeah .
9288	Yes , yes .
9289	That is quite what PowerPoint does .
9290	But y you can
9291	if you save this image , you can open it in your shared work folder .
9292	Yeah .
9293	I know ,
9294	but
9295	I know ,
9296	but we could not use that feature , so I missed it .
9297	So it is almost
9298	yeah .
9299	Yep .
9300	We were not able to do that .
9301	At least the I was not explained how to do such a th
9302	Okay .
9303	A and the function of of filling an an an oval or an an object .
9304	An object , yes .
9305	Yes .
9306	The drawing cap capabilities are very limited .
9307	I it is not possible
9308	yeah .
9309	And and w you were when you are using Windows , you are used to a certain interface and certain buttons , which you can use for drawing .
9310	Yeah .
9311	And a lot of these buttons do not appear here .
9312	So it is
9313	Not not n not way .
9314	Oh it looks like paint actually .
9315	Okay , so
9316	y it
9317	it is not even as advanced as paint .
9318	Yeah .
9319	It is quite limited .
9320	Okay .
9321	no .
9322	Yeah , the project is evaluated .
9323	but , well ,
9324	we need to redesign the product .
9325	Okay .
9326	Oh ,
9327	very good ,
9328	celebration .
9329	Celebrate
9330	Pop pop up the champagne .
9331	Great .
9332	It was a privilege working with you .
9333	Okay .
9334	you are dismissed .
9335	No , I think we are ready .
9336	Okay .
9337	To private rooms ?
9338	But you see the problem ,
9339	y you ca not continue your your line .
9340	I see some action over there .
9341	Private room , Roo .
9342	That sounds quite scary .
9343	Okay .
9344	No , let is find the way to .
9345	we are done , we are finished , I believe .
9346	So ,
9347	are there any more cycles in this process ?
9348	I think not .
9349	I do not believe so .
9350	Well ,
9351	maybe we would get an email .
9352	Thank you for your Forty minutes .
9353	But how much time did we get for this meeting ?
9354	And how much time is left ?
9355	Ten minutes .
9356	A minute or or ten maybe .
9357	M
9358	Yeah , ten or five .
9359	Okay .
9360	Okay .
9361	So ,
9362	we can redesign our I would like to
9363	Oh .
9364	Well ,
9365	I think we we we all know what the redesign should be .
9366	A simple , dull , one coloured box .
9367	And no added value .
9368	No ,
9369	it is it is just the same product that is already on the market .
9370	At all .
9371	So
9372	In interesting design .
9373	Yeah .
9374	Well ,
9375	it is fluffy alright .
9376	Spongy .
9377	What is that ?
9378	It is a giraffe eating a eating leaves from a tree .
9379	A giraffe ?
9380	Right .
9381	Yeah .
9382	It is blue tongue .
9383	Yeah .
9384	This is a new model .
9385	But
9386	Blue tongue .
9387	So you are actually promoting Bluetooth .
9388	Or blue tongue .
9389	Oh it it does have a natural feeling .
9390	So
9391	Yeah .
9392	It is spongy .
9393	That is it is a new feature next to Bluetooth to disable all Bluetooth devices .
9394	Blue tongue .
9395	Okay .
9396	Yeah ,
9397	we are done here .
9398	Let is wrap it up .
9399	Gentlemen , thank you for your cooperation .

9412	That is my
9413	that is the agenda for today .
9414	Well ,
9415	of course we are new to each other ,
9416	so I would like to get acquainted first .
9417	So let is do that first ,
9418	I mean
9419	Let is start with you ,
9420	can you introduce yourself ?
9421	You are our Marketing Expert .
9422	Yes .
9423	my name is Dirk , Dirk Meinfeld .
9424	I will be Pr Project the Marketing Expert .
9425	And I will see what the user wants and what we can do with the new produ project product .
9426	Okay , excellent .
9427	And you are User Interface
9428	Yeah .
9429	Nick Broer , User Interface Designer .
9430	I am going to look at the technical design from the user point of view .
9431	Excellent .
9432	Okay .
9433	My name is Xavier Juergens , I am the Industrial Designer , and there are three main questions that I have to find an answer to today .
9434	First one is what happens inside the apparatus , second is what is the apparatus made of , and the third is what should it look like .
9435	What should it look like ?
9436	Okay .
9437	Oh ,
9438	let is kick it off .
9439	Oh , there we go .
9440	So ,
9441	our new project is about
9442	we need design a remote control for television set ,
9443	so ,
9444	which has to be original , trendy and user friendly .
9445	I took this off our corporate website .
9446	It is
9447	I think well it sums up what we need to do .
9448	We are inspired by latest fashion , not only electronics , but also the latest trends in clothes and interior design .
9449	That is why our product will always fit in your home .
9450	So apparently we need to be very at very open to what is currently hot in the market .
9451	So that is what you need to do to bring us the latest info and what people want .
9452	Yeah .
9453	Yeah .
9454	So So
9455	we put the fashion in electronics .
9456	So that is what we need to go for .
9457	Anyway , we will take this project in three steps , three pha three phase of design .
9458	First step will be the functional design .
9459	Yeah .
9460	And that is basically what we are going to do .
9461	Everybody has a piece of individual work and a meeting afterwards , so we can share information
9462	about
9463	So
9464	I am going to keep this short ,
9465	since we had a technical problem .
9466	So skip through this .
9467	Okay .
9468	Every meeting we everybody can present their their views and everything , so to help with these , you have we have the SMARTboards here .
9469	We can use a regular PowerPoint presentation .
9470	I am supposed to give you an introduction on this doodling board ,
9471	so it is
9472	actually it is very easy .
9473	Like it says , very simple ,
9474	you just take out the pen .
9475	Like you see here , I will just take the take here .
9476	That is it , you just put it on the board .
9477	You see a pen here .
9478	You go here , just like using a pen .
9479	You can just draw whatever you want .
9480	It is like the eraser , can erase whatever you want .
9481	And so it will be easy just to illustrate your views , if you want to change the format , you just either take out jus just like the pen , and whatever you want , your current colour , your line width , just to make the line bigger .
9482	So it should be really easy .
9483	Okay .
9484	This is to take the
9485	just take a new slide and back again .
9486	We are just going to keep using this board all the time ,
9487	so I think it will be
9488	it is very clear for everyone , I suppose .
9489	So
9490	I will take this out .
9491	Okay .
9492	We will use that later .
9493	Anyway .
9494	Yeah , just just
9495	just stuff that you want to share , just put it in the in the project folder ,
9496	like I put my presentation now .
9497	I will put the the minutes of every meeting , I will put them there too ,
9498	so everybody can read up if they have to leave early or whatever .
9499	So
9500	next , been here .
9501	Well ,
9502	going to give the electronic white board a shot .
9503	So
9504	basic idea is we have a blank sheet .
9505	Just try whatever you want , and like it says , draw your favourite animal .
9506	I think the creative genius should go first .
9507	The creative genius ?
9508	Thank you very much .
9509	So , draw us your favourite animal .
9510	Well ,
9511	I am more into the technical aspects of drawing ,
9512	so I am not really good at drawing animals ,
9513	but the animal which I Oh .
9514	Draw us a technical animal .
9515	Yeah , it is still erasing .
9516	Pen .
9517	format .
9518	Else my animal will be like king size .
9519	I pretty much like a dolphin ,
9520	because of its its freedom basically .
9521	Let is see .
9522	A head .
9523	actually worked with this .
9524	It is like it is a very high tech .
9525	Bit low responsive though .
9526	Prefer pen and paper .
9527	So that is what we do not want .
9528	We want a high responsive product .
9529	So
9530	It looks more like nuclear bomb .
9531	Very nice dolphin .
9532	It does not look like a nuclear bomb .
9533	This thing is not doing what I am What I want .
9534	So
9535	Yeah , well it does look like a nuclear bomb .
9536	Let is go easy on it .
9537	I will just finish up real soon ,
9538	because I am
9539	So it does not really look like a dolphin , but then again , this is all new for me .
9540	Anyway , it should It
9541	It is supposed to be a dolphin , you like the freedom that it that it represents .
9542	Uh huh .
9543	Like the ocean , like swimming .
9544	Do that in my spare time ,
9545	so that is basically an
9546	Now we can forget this ever happened .
9547	What do you like ?
9548	Okay .
9549	Well ,
9550	our Marketing Expert .
9551	Show us an animal .
9552	an animal .
9553	I like the elephant .
9554	Pick a pick a
9555	pick a clean sheet .
9556	Oh .
9557	What ?
9558	Yeah .
9559	Take a clean sheet first .
9560	Oh yeah .
9561	Just press next .
9562	That is it .
9563	Oh , a blank .
9564	Okay ,
9565	next .
9566	Free ,
9567	I like the elephant .
9568	It is big , it is strong ,
9569	so Oh ,
9570	it is a little bit
9571	You have to hold it ,
9572	right ?
9573	It is not really that responsive , no .
9574	It is a beautiful animal .
9575	Oh ,
9576	you have to p press it pretty hard .
9577	With a smile on it ,
9578	it is very important .
9579	It is a cute elephant .
9580	Yeah .
9581	And not to forget its tail .
9582	Oh .
9583	It is a nice beard .
9584	Yeah , it is okay .
9585	And you was making comments on my dolphin .
9586	Yes .
9587	I will beat the dolphin .
9588	No .
9589	Okay , so
9590	it is just a bee .
9591	Yeah .
9592	So
9593	I suggest you make us the elephant in the market .
9594	The big and strong player in the market .
9595	Yeah .
9596	This would be good .
9597	Yeah .
9598	Okay , excellent .
9599	On to the next one .
9600	Okay .
9601	yeah .
9602	Okay ,
9603	you should press next .
9604	Yeah .
9605	Press next .
9606	Yeah , it is up there .
9607	Okay .
9608	That is it .
9609	Okay , well
9610	the animal I would like to draw is a tiger .
9611	You picked a hard one , did not you ?
9612	Got it .
9613	Experience with the tiger .
9614	My drawing skills are really bad , so .
9615	What ?
9616	They are Okay uh huh .
9617	They are really bad , my drawing skills .
9618	Sure looks smooth .
9619	Oh .
9620	I am not sure how the legs should go ,
9621	but
9622	these are stripes .
9623	I have picked this animal because it is very fast .
9624	It is
9625	it knows exactly what it wants .
9626	it hardly ever wastes any resources .
9627	What does it want ?
9628	Okay .
9629	well , basically
9630	it hunts for prey , but it does it always in a very well thought way .
9631	it knows exactly what it wants .
9632	It never kills an animal just for the killing , so it is very efficient .
9633	And it tries to do everything as fast as possible .
9634	And it always goes for security , in seeking a hide spot and and doing everything , security , speed and efficiency is important .
9635	And I think those things we can use .
9636	I agree .
9637	Okay .
9638	Yay
9639	, I am supposed to draw the animal next .
9640	I introduce to the world the amazing ant .
9641	hard worker .
9642	Great team workers .
9643	Yeah .
9644	Yeah .
9645	Do everything to
9646	really small , but together they are really strong .
9647	So I am going to give it a smiley face .
9648	Yeah ,
9649	yeah .
9650	Oh .
9651	Not sure where the p .
9652	Just put them here .
9653	Whatever .
9654	Think it need shoes .
9655	So
9656	I am just too lazy to draw it all black , so
9657	That is the coolest ant ever .
9658	You have done this before , have not you ?
9659	Well ,
9660	I basically had a question .
9661	I love to draw ants .
9662	It is my hobby .
9663	Anyway Nah .
9664	Just
9665	I think it is very representative what we drew , I guess .
9666	Like you take just take your freedom and use a a trendy interface that you design for us .
9667	Yeah .
9668	Just Yeah .
9669	You are supposed to make i make it different from from what other people have , and just make it a little distinct .
9670	Anyway .
9671	another beep to stop the meeting .
9672	See .
9673	Warning .
9674	Finish meeting now .
9675	put this down .
9676	Examples .
9677	Well
9678	I guess we have a little little time extra ,
9679	but
9680	Just a little quick discussion to to open open our work .
9681	So what do you guys think about
9682	The first idea is just very short .
9683	I will start with you .
9684	What are y
9685	What are your first ideas for the new product ?
9686	What
9687	The project I got was just for a TV remote control .
9688	Do
9689	Are we going to introduce a multi remote control ?
9690	Is it just the TV
9691	or do we want to in
9692	Just for TV remote control .
9693	Yeah .
9694	Yeah , I guess so .
9695	Okay .
9696	Well ,
9697	I was thinking about design remote control , with our motto and all .
9698	But
9699	Yeah .
9700	thing to keep in mind is that we need to stick to what people are familiar with .
9701	No rational changes or whatever , cause it revolutionary changes ,
9702	yes .
9703	Okay ,
9704	so very intuitive design , I guess .
9705	we might have to consider other design aspects of our product .
9706	So that was something I wanted to add ,
9707	and perhaps some usability aspect .
9708	TV is becoming central in most homes .
9709	Do we want people who are disabled in any way to , yeah , to be able to use it as well ?
9710	Yeah .
9711	Yeah , we want
9712	I suppose we want almost everyone to be using it .
9713	So I think I mean , really disabled people , yeah , might be a problem ,
9714	but I think it is a little take it into consideration .
9715	yeah .
9716	I think we really need to cut the meeting short .
9717	You have anything you want to share quickly ?
9718	It should be light , okay .
9719	Only one thing that has to be added according to me
9720	is the the material it is made of , it should be something light .
9721	That is
9722	it speaks for itself ,
9723	but some
9724	Yeah .
9725	Yeah .
9726	, let is see ,
9727	where did I
9728	Let is skip that .
9729	Oh , this is it .
9730	Sorry ,
9731	I skipped this sheet .
9732	Selling price .
9733	What do we
9734	This Quick
9735	What we are going to
9736	Selling price , twenty five Euros .
9737	That is for you .
9738	The production price , twelve and a half Euros , approximately .
9739	Okay .
9740	Just go go for that .
9741	We will reach the reach that profit .
9742	Okay .
9743	Okay , well
9744	that is not that much to work with .
9745	international .
9746	No , it is not much to work on .
9747	I am sorry ,
9748	I skipped it .
9749	Anyways , that is
9750	Yeah ,
9751	this is it .
9752	Do you have anything you you came up with yet ?
9753	About marketing transfer , whatever ?
9754	Marketing

9756	about what ?
9757	Marketing ?

9759	but I have some ideas
9760	and I will say it

9794	We are about to start ,
9795	so have a seat .
9796	Okay ,
9797	welcome again .
9798	Today , functional design phase .
9799	I will take you over the minutes of last last meeting .
9800	Okay ,
9801	that was just to get to know each other , have a little thoughts on what your vision is and on this project ,
9802	so
9803	I put the minutes on the I made on the on the p the the project share , so if you want to review them , they are there .
9804	I will do so after every meeting ,
9805	so if you have some information you want to take back you can find it there .
9806	Anyways ,
9807	today three presentations , from every one of you .
9808	after that I got some new project requirements from project board , so we are going to go af go after over this later .
9809	But I want to start with stuff you did first ,
9810	so we can see what everybody came up with .
9811	And after that we can have the new requirements and share some thoughts ,
9812	so .
9813	Who would like want to go first ?
9814	Take it .
9815	Yeah , sure , no problem .
9816	Go ahead .
9817	there was a little problem with my computer so not the whole presentation
9818	Yeah .
9819	Anyway ,
9820	let is see what you have .
9821	Okay ,
9822	I want to open the my s
9823	oh no .
9824	it is still a bit open .
9825	You should close it on your own notebook , I guess .
9826	Yeah .
9827	Oh no , that is okay .
9828	So there ?
9829	Okay .
9830	slide show .
9831	Yes .
9832	The functional requirements , it is very important for the user ,
9833	he he wants to
9834	yeah .
9835	The the method we used it it is not m not a slide , because it went wrong , but the method we use , we tested it w with a hundred men , and we asked them to w what the remote f feel like and what what is important .
9836	If I can cut in ,
9837	is it people or men ?
9838	Is it people , okay .
9839	People ,
9840	sorry .
9841	Both women and men ,
9842	yeah .
9843	Cause I thought it was only men ,
9844	so
9845	Kay .
9846	Okay .
9847	the findings seventy five percent of the users find most remote controls ugly .
9848	Yeah ,
9849	and
9850	yeah ,
9851	most th th
9852	they want to spend money for a better system , for better remote control ,
9853	so we can do a l a little nice things with it ,
9854	and they use
9855	yeah ,
9856	they use zap a lot ,
9857	fifty percent say they only
9858	So
9859	that is the most important things .
9860	That is pretty shocking .
9861	So we have to s we have to do something about that .
9862	Okay .
9863	oh yeah ,
9864	not all of it is it on mine on my PowerPoint presentation , but the relevant buttons are the power , the channel selection and the volume selection .
9865	Okay ,
9866	just talk ahead .
9867	It is the most basic buttons that a user wants to use .
9868	less important is tel teletext , they use it , but it is not very important on the scale of zero to ten they six and a half
9869	and
9870	but not important is the channel selection ,
9871	the the
9872	Oh ,
9873	the the
9874	no no no no
9875	no ,
9876	that is very important , but w and not important in the audio settings , display settings
9877	and
9878	Yeah .
9879	Okay , that is okay .
9880	That is a little weird .
9881	Which channel selection ?
9882	Oh , okay .
9883	Okay ,
9884	we can we can hide those under a menu or something ,
9885	okay .
9886	new preferences preferences .
9887	beep to find your control ,
9888	was
9889	that was in the test , the the most people f find it irritating when they cannot find a rem their remote control ,
9890	so I think it is a bee beep to sound it
9891	and you can find it .
9892	That is like a button on your TV ?
9893	Remote , okay .
9894	And another thing they want was speech recognition
9895	so they can say what they want to let is go to channel one and that is kind of things .
9896	Okay .
9897	And they want maybe an LCD screen
9898	to to look it
9899	wh what is on every channel and what do I want with it ?
9900	Yeah .
9901	We want to have a little preview on the remote control .
9902	Preview what is on the channel .
9903	Okay .
9904	Is that manageable ?
9905	Cause it sounds pretty expensive too .
9906	That sounds too
9907	It is possible ,
9908	but I think it is expensive ,
9909	but do continue .
9910	Yeah .
9911	Okay .
9912	Yeah .
9913	my personal preferences is a button for my favourite channel ,
9914	so I can I dunno ,
9915	so I can zap to my f quick to my favourite channel
9916	wh
9917	what I
9918	so , the remote mu must see or must see wha what mine preferences are for which channel ,
9919	so I can zap t to
9920	What ?
9921	Yeah .
9922	Okay ,
9923	you do not set it yourself , it just remembers the channel that you are on most , for example .
9924	You want the you want it to be programmed , for example
9925	y programmed f
9926	or you want it to recognise your favourite channel ?
9927	Let is see ,
9928	you you spend twenty minutes each day on that channel , so it recognises your favourite channel .
9929	Yeah .
9930	Recognise
9931	Yeah .
9932	Yeah , that is what my personal preference like .
9933	Okay , so
9934	it is it
9935	it does
9936	it recognise itself , you do not have to set it
9937	Okay .
9938	No , itself .
9939	Maybe it is easier to to sell it ,
9940	but
9941	I do not know it is manageable , but we will we will see .
9942	Okay .
9943	I see .
9944	Yeah ,
9945	it is a little bit
9946	it is the end of it .
9947	It is a little bit I lost it , the computer crashed ,
9948	so .
9949	Okay .
9950	Okay .
9951	No problem , it is it is okay ,
9952	that is
9953	Yeah , go ahead .
9954	Shall I go ?
9955	Okay .
9956	Yeah .
9957	So ,
9958	some technical functions .
9959	Darn computer .
9960	Basically I have some issues which you discussed earlier .
9961	Yeah .
9962	let is just start with the method .
9963	It sounds really easy ,
9964	what does the user do , what does the th remote control do ,
9965	but there are quite some issues .
9966	So
9967	the things I am going to concentrate on are the user aspect ,
9968	because the technical aspect , that is pretty much covered .
9969	We can do that .
9970	What goes wrong at the user .
9971	Gets the remote control .
9972	Where is the remote control ?
9973	We have all had it once ,
9974	I want to watch some television , where is the remote control ?
9975	That was one of your ideas which you posted in the network folder ,
9976	a really good idea .
9977	Yeah .
9978	Yeah .
9979	That seems very good .
9980	these are just the issues .
9981	I come to some personal experience , findings , possible solutions later .
9982	Searches for the button .
9983	There are many buttons on a remote control which are not clear .
9984	so either we lose those or we try to make it a little bit more clear .
9985	also symbols tend to fade after a while .
9986	There is nothing more annoying than faded symbols ,
9987	because you do not know which channel is this button ,
9988	so possibly we could find something for that ,
9989	yes .
9990	Okay , so
9991	have it more make it more durable actually .
9992	Okay .
9993	covered that .
9994	Oh yes ,
9995	user presses the button .
9996	usually when you have a lot of buttons , buttons are small .
9997	So you press more once remote control goes kablouey or something like that ,
9998	so we have to pay attention not to put too mun too many buttons on the remote control .
9999	Okay , so
10000	the buttons should be
10001	Yeah .
10002	And possibly also the size , so more important buttons , bigger
10003	si
10004	So
10005	this is basically what I h had in mind in the fade proof symbols , locator , a sound ,
10006	so
10007	clear we should stick to existing symbols , but maybe we could do a little investigation to see whether some symbols are need to be replaced by others .
10008	Wow .
10009	The s
10010	Yeah .
10011	Make it make them bigger .
10012	Even more durable .
10013	Okay .
10014	This I pretty much covered .
10015	So what we want to go to is not this one , but more less buttons , easy , some bigger buttons .
10016	Yeah , it is true .
10017	Yeah .
10018	So
10019	that is basically what I had in mind .
10020	Yeah , that is clear .
10021	This is not the final design , this is just a general idea of how I would like to see basically the general idea .
10022	No , of course
10023	Yeah .
10024	I must say that it
10025	So
10026	that was it .
10027	That was it .
10028	Okay ,
10029	that was good .
10030	So we agree on the the part that we need to get something on the on the remote to find it somewhere and increase it the durability of of the thing ,
10031	so
10032	The other aspects , we will just see how what you came up with and what is possible for that budget .
10033	Yeah , I think it is a really good idea .
10034	Yeah .
10035	Yeah .
10036	Okay .
10037	Okay , that is fine .
10038	Okay , now
10039	work a little with me .
10040	Okay .
10041	Well ,
10042	let is start it as it is .
10043	Okay ,
10044	the method .
10045	There are a few questions that need to be answered , you already talked about it a little bit .
10046	Which buttons are wanted ,
10047	is our remote control universal or should it be programmable .
10048	if it should be programmeab grammeale then we need something like a mode that you can switch it .
10049	Because then the buttons have to send out a different signal then they would normally do .
10050	And how big is the remote control going to be ?
10051	I will tell you why that is important to me .
10052	there are a lot of technical parts in the remote control ,
10053	so that is why I also would like to say go a little bit easy on the designs ,
10054	I heard ab you talking about beeps and about video screens , but the material inside and the technical aspects are quite complex already .
10055	So keep in mind that everything that you keep think of , it has to b to be built .
10056	So
10057	it is
10058	that is not as easy as it s might look like .
10059	Yeah .
10060	Of course , .
10061	Okay .
10062	material study , I am working on that for the the costs .
10063	I have to check out how far I can go with that .
10064	Normally , a circuit board is made of fibreglass and the wires are made of copper .
10065	that is how it is done and all the remote controls work that way ,
10066	I think we can just go on with that .
10067	then I have read more integration of materials means less cost for the production .
10068	The more we can make at once in one piece , that is cheaper .
10069	You mean integrate them all into the circuit board .
10070	Exactly , so if we make a circuit board with the the connections already on it , then that is cheaper .
10071	Okay .
10072	Yeah , okay .
10073	So we have to make something that is not too difficult in design again .
10074	So you have
10075	This is what look like looks like if you press one button , so this is not the entire thing .
10076	You have the the power coming in , then you have like a switch .
10077	The switch if you p press it then some electrical charge goes into the processor , that thinks over a Morse code ,
10078	that is how you should see it .
10079	The Morse code goes to the amplifier , then the signal is sent to two light bulbs .
10080	You have infrared
10081	and an interv
10082	how to say it ?
10083	a light in indication , light that you know that it is functioning .
10084	here again , that is my story about the different modes , if you do want to make remote universal , then the processor has to make up a different Morse code when some button is pressed .
10085	That makes it much more complex ,
10086	so we really need to have a look , do we want that or not .
10087	I do not have any personal p preferences so far ,
10088	except for the materials to be used light , that they are light .
10089	Okay .
10090	Okay .
10091	That was it ?
10092	I will get back to my thing then .
10093	That was it .
10094	Okay ,
10095	back this up to the screen .
10096	So
10097	I got some new information on the project specifications are changing a little .
10098	Like you said teletext is not not very popular anymore because the the internet , nowadays people do not use the teletext anymore or hardly ,
10099	so it can either
10100	Well ,
10101	I do not think we should remove the button ,
10102	because there are always people who are using it .
10103	Yeah .
10104	But I do not think it should be very it should be one of the big buttons for example .
10105	Just put it somewhere or under second option or whatever .
10106	It is not important anymore .
10107	we are targeting young people now ,
10108	because our
10109	This is a new product and with this new product we want to appeal to younger people ,
10110	which are
10111	the younger people were defined under forty .
10112	Yeah .
10113	I
10114	so I think it is
10115	that is also good with the fashion and everything ,
10116	so yeah .
10117	B
10118	Yeah ,
10119	and they want to pay for it
10120	and With more Where
10121	with more technical specifications
10122	in the
10123	Yeah .
10124	They want to pay for it , people are willing to spend money actually to buy a remote that they like .
10125	If they like the way it looks , the way it functions , so they are actually going to spend spend money on it .
10126	Yeah .
10127	see how far we can go with it anyway , so And one thing that should be important is that the corporate l colour and slogan are recognisable , which is apparently black and yellow ,
10128	but I am not sure if we
10129	I think we should keep the the logo in mind ,
10130	because with colours you can have a lot of fashionable colours and everything on it , which suits everybody is taste .
10131	So
10132	With that concept I started thinking , so why not just steal Nokia is idea and just make changeable covers for your
10133	I mean those cost hardly anything I think , and people could even spend extra money on buying a cover and so have an entire new remote control that they like to see .
10134	Oh .
10135	Yeah .
10136	Or we can sh
10137	for example we can make a different a basic design .
10138	And sell the covers separately , for example .
10139	That is just a little marketing idea that could be applied ,
10140	so you can p
10141	it appeals to really everyone .
10142	So you do not have to I think you do not have to make entire remote controls .
10143	We make a basic one and manufacture this cover separately .
10144	So
10145	that was that was my idea on what we could do to appeal this product to everyone .
10146	So
10147	just
10148	I am not sure if you came up with anything in the meantime , after making a presentation .
10149	Yeah .
10150	Would you like to share ?
10151	Okay .
10152	No ,
10153	I think this is a good idea .
10154	But
10155	Go ahead .
10156	But oh ?
10157	Yeah ,
10158	with with an LCD screen you can
10159	Why ?
10160	Nokia w
10161	Is it manageable ?
10162	Is it easy ?
10163	Yeah .
10164	Oh yeah .
10165	I think we should lose the LCD screen ,
10166	like you said .
10167	Y
10168	Yes , I think so too .
10169	I think for example it is it is huge
10170	I think the LCD is huge , it consumes batteries like hell .
10171	I think it takes up a lot of a lot of power .
10172	And it costs too much to fabricate , so we are on a tight budget here .
10173	It costs a lot , I think .
10174	Okay ,
10175	Okay .
10176	What we could do , what could be possible , is maybe not an LCD screen but with a preview ,
10177	but y
10178	I am not sure if it is even possible .
10179	For example , a little TV guide .
10180	Like you have a little
10181	just just a text only , not colour , just a little text thing
10182	so you can use your remote as a TV guide .
10183	Yeah .
10184	I am not sure it is even possible ,
10185	but maybe okay , make it
10186	Yeah ,
10187	find a little compromise in that ,
10188	but
10189	What did I write down ?
10190	I think the p yeah , the beep is a very simple thing to imple implement , just make a button on your TV and just hit the button , it beeps somewhere .
10191	I have to check that out ,
10192	I am not sure .
10193	Yeah .
10194	That must be possible .
10195	I think it is easy to implement ,
10196	we should go for that .
10197	Ja .
10198	I am sorry ,
10199	whe where do you want to hit the T you want to
10200	we want a button on the television .
10201	And it is
10202	Maybe just a slap on sticker with a button which sends out a small signal .
10203	speech recognition .
10204	I thin
10205	Yeah ,
10206	I mean where else should you put it ?
10207	Yeah ,
10208	but how are you going to use that if your
10209	I mean if your remote control is lost , how are you going to press where are you going to press the button ?
10210	A slap on sticker .
10211	In th
10212	okay ,
10213	but that rules out a universal remote control .
10214	Because that is not possible .
10215	Yeah .
10216	Exactly .
10217	Oh ,
10218	you mean as like a separate thing you can attach to your TV .
10219	Yeah , exactly .
10220	Yeah , that could be possible .
10221	A little little box you can attach to your TV is fine then , okay .
10222	Okay ,
10223	then I would I would like to know now if we want the universal remote control or not ,
10224	because that is determines everything I am going to do .
10225	I think it is universal .
10226	I think we should go for universal ,
10227	because apparently we are a separate company making separate c remote controls to sell to a lot of diverse people .
10228	If not
10229	Okay .
10230	Yeah .
10231	I think universal remote control should be possible .
10232	Everyone wants to buy it ,
10233	so we w
10234	yeah .
10235	Okay ,
10236	then I go for that .
10237	Yeah ,
10238	I think we are targeting everyone ,
10239	so remote
10240	Okay , universal is good .
10241	Yeah .
10242	Okay .
10243	No ,
10244	it is fine with me ,
10245	but then I know what to look for .
10246	Speech recognition , I think it is very hard ,
10247	because we are selling across multiple countries .
10248	So I think implementing speech recognition is such a small apparatus , it is very hard to do .
10249	Yeah .
10250	Or one .
10251	Or when you say one two i it it is enough ,
10252	right ?
10253	But
10254	Oh yeah .
10255	And it is
10256	Besides that , the technology is not really super yet ,
10257	so that is a problem in implementing this .
10258	Yeah ,
10259	but I do not see Arabian people speaking one , two whatever .
10260	It is
10261	Yeah .
10262	Yeah .
10263	It is not a mature technology , I think it takes a lot of memory and everything in in a remote control ,
10264	so
10265	I do not think it should be implemented in a remote control yet .
10266	Okay .
10267	It is a good idea , but it is just not I do not think the market is ripe for that yet .
10268	Uh huh .
10269	Yeah .
10270	What else do we have ?
10271	well
10272	you should you should look into the in into the materials that are real durable .
10273	So the the the symbols wo not fade ,
10274	maybe a little harder plastic
10275	or especially li we do not
10276	maybe we do not have have to do all the buttons , but especially the ones that are the popular buttons ,
10277	so those always fade first .
10278	Exactly .
10279	I already noted that .
10280	, okay .
10281	Okay .
10282	the thing is the most important things that we have now .
10283	Let is see .
10284	If we make a remote control with changeable covers , then we can also make a cover for every language area .
10285	That is fo is
10286	especially for older people , that they can read it read it in their own language .
10287	For example ?
10288	Well ,
10289	we are not we are not targeting older people ,
10290	we should remember that .
10291	Yeah .
10292	Everything we target is under forty ,
10293	so .
10294	That is
10295	okay
10296	, okay .
10297	You assume that that they read correctly
10298	and I think they are
10299	The most important thing about young people is that they are really sensitive to to trends that are passing through the world ,
10300	so
10301	No , of course .
10302	Huh .
10303	But b But every
10304	Oh .
10305	okay .
10306	But should the exchangeable covers include the buttons themselves
10307	or just the C
10308	that is a problem with the with the text then .
10309	No ,
10310	I think it is just something you you put over them ,
10311	because
10312	Yeah we c
10313	Yeah , you ca
10314	Well ,
10315	tha that is not a that is not a bad that is not even
10316	it is not even a bad idea .
10317	I mean , for example , if you are if you are into the durability issue
10318	you could
10319	For example , if your buttons are faded , after I mean if you make a durable remote , they are faded , you can just buy a new cover .
10320	I am not sure it is it is hard to make .
10321	Okay .
10322	but I know that the buttons are like a Nokia telephone on one sleeve ,
10323	so you do not have to change your whole cover .
10324	So it is a good and a bad idea .
10325	we can make something that you can only remove the sleeve .
10326	Know what I mean ?
10327	It works the same as a Nokia telephone ,
10328	it is it is in my kay .
10329	Oh yeah ,
10330	I know what you mean .
10331	Yeah , I know ,
10332	it is just just a one one piece of rubber for example ,
10333	okay .
10334	Yeah .
10335	Exactly .
10336	Yeah .
10337	Yeah ,
10338	that is what I
10339	something I have to look into .
10340	Either either change both the buttons and and the cover or just the cover ,
10341	I am not sure which which is easier ,
10342	so
10343	anyway , yeah ,
10344	this is what we are going to do afterwards , just lunch break and have more individual work after that ,
10345	so let is see what we let is see we
10346	So
10347	you have to come up with a components concept ,
10348	yeah .
10349	I want some
10350	you should do some trend watching , because even if we are if we are going to do those covers and everything , what people really want , that is what we need to know in this phase ,
10351	because that is going to be the essential final design that we are going to come up with .
10352	Yeah .
10353	Yeah .
10354	Okay .
10355	Yeah ,
10356	I think user interface is fairly obvious .
10357	I mean it should be very intuitive ,
10358	s
10359	Yeah ,
10360	it should speak for itself .
10361	Pretty straightforward .
10362	for example I bought a remote control last week with a new TV ,
10363	it was it l
10364	it is like all buttons
10365	and you have no idea what it does at first , and I am total TV new , anyway .
10366	So
10367	I think it should be have less or l very little buttons and maybe a second second level menu for the advanced things .
10368	Or maybe just stick them under a menu ,
10369	like you said the the sound options and the surround and whatever , they are more complicated ,
10370	just stick them under one menu
10371	and give it a
10372	just put it in in s in a software piece , you can menu and you can select everything you want to to set on your TV .
10373	Is it techni technically possible to send a signal to a television and then pops up a menu ,
10374	because we are working with different types of television ,
10375	so we are going to work with that ?
10376	It is an in built menu ,
10377	is not it ?
10378	Yes .
10379	Yeah .
10380	That is true .
10381	I do not think so .
10382	No , that is true .
10383	No , I do not think so .
10384	Because the television needs to respond to the signal ,
10385	and if it does not know how , it is
10386	Exactly ,
10387	that is not possible .
10388	Yeah , that is true .
10389	So basically
10390	we
10391	Or we could use a double sided for less used functions
10392	you
10393	Yeah ,
10394	with the cover .
10395	I am not sure if it is impossible ,
10396	but there is a chance it is not ,
10397	so .
10398	A double sided remote control ?
10399	I do not think that is useful .
10400	I
10401	it is basically an idea to overcome these issues ,
10402	because
10403	No ,
10404	but basic functions
10405	but functions which are not frequently used .
10406	Yeah ,
10407	but then you are going to have a lot of wasted buttons .
10408	For example you have a Sony TV and the half of the buttons wo not function if you have a for a Sony that wo not for a Philips TV .
10409	Yeah .
10410	Because if we use a universal remote control , we are going to have to have most buttons on it ,
10411	so
10412	Yeah .
10413	I do not think we should
10414	Yeah ,
10415	for exam I am not s
10416	yeah ,
10417	for ex
10418	you have to make it a little decision between the part if you want a universal remote control that it should do what people usually do with their TVs , not not the very complicated settings
10419	that you can usually do that with either a old old remote control if they really hate that thing , but you ca not you cannot take into consideration all the different brands of TVs .
10420	yeah .
10421	But that might be broken .
10422	I think there is
10423	I think there is a standard for example between because usually the the menu is
10424	the menu button is is usable between different brands .
10425	Especially the big ones , the big brands ,
10426	so .
10427	Cause everybody
10428	I have a universal remote control and it can use the menu button ,
10429	so I think
10430	I am not sure ,
10431	if you can put some research into that , if it is possible .
10432	I think just a b
10433	and the navigation is very basic , it is usually the same thing .
10434	okay .
10435	But I think there must be a way to invoke the more complicated functions of a television .
10436	For instance , if your old remote control is broken and you buy ours , then you should be able to get everything out of the television that is in it .
10437	Yeah .
10438	Yeah , that is true .
10439	Yeah .
10440	Because otherwise you will lose functions by buying our
10441	Okay , I thi I think so too .
10442	I think so
10443	we need to put some research into that if if we can open the menu ,
10444	I think it is possible ,
10445	just the way how to .
10446	Yeah .
10447	Yeah ,
10448	yeah .
10449	Yeah ,
10450	then then you could do everything I suppose , because usually the TVs have tha
10451	that inside in this other little piece of software ,
10452	so it is okay .
10453	And I think that our r remote control should not look like any other .
10454	For instance Sony makes all their remote controls exactly the same for all their devices , and you always grab the wrong one because formatting of the buttons is exactly the same , only the labels are different .
10455	Yeah .
10456	Yeah I think it should be a little distinct from everything else ,
10457	because it is either it is both mayb
10458	maybe the shape can be a little different .
10459	We should not do that .
10460	Exactly .
10461	Yeah .
10462	Yeah ,
10463	I have some ideas .
10464	I have some ideas .
10465	Maybe it is a little more curves or whatever .
10466	yeah .
10467	that is your division .
10468	And with different colours .
10469	So
10470	Yeah ,
10471	this .
10472	I will put some on paper and present them next time the ideas that I have .
10473	Not sure what
10474	because we have forty minutes , I am not sure how much time we have left for the meeting anyway ,
10475	so .
10476	Okay .
10477	I heard a beep go .
10478	Yeah ,
10479	but it was not me , it was him closing something .
10480	Yeah .
10481	So anyway
10482	, yeah ,
10483	we could do some
10484	i do some work now on on the design for example .
10485	I mean what do you want ,
10486	do you want , but
10487	Yeah ,
10488	may maybe something like this .
10489	Yeah ,
10490	but we like some some curves
10491	or
10492	Yeah .
10493	But though smooth inside .
10494	So you have the transmitter here for example .
10495	Let is see that you what would be handy .
10496	I think that the the buttons should be the channel buttons should be on their own .
10497	And a light
10498	Volume .
10499	Let is see
10500	one , two
10501	God damn it .
10502	Oh ,
10503	we get the general ideas , yes .
10504	Yeah , okay .
10505	Another one here .
10506	Let is see what I think this should
10507	these are always on top of the of the control ,
10508	so they should be here .
10509	Yeah ,
10510	and since you are holding it like this , I suggest you put the channel up channel down and volume
10511	yeah yeah .
10512	Think it is like this .
10513	Withi within the
10514	Yeah ,
10515	just take it .
10516	So
10517	you have the up channel the down channel
10518	the volume , do we want that horizontal or vertical ?
10519	This is basically what people are accustomed to ,
10520	so
10521	Yeah ,
10522	but this is just a g general idea .
10523	Do you take triangles
10524	or I think it should be
10525	I think it
10526	Maybe we should make them bigger or whatever .
10527	it is it is fine , I think .
10528	Yeah .
10529	Oh d
10530	Yeah .
10531	Yeah .
10532	maybe the menu button can go i in the middle .
10533	Yeah , in the middle .
10534	It is it is usually there ,
10535	but
10536	Whoa .
10537	Perhaps we should also make something like a flash on it , if you if it is lost , for people that are deaf .
10538	They they wo not hear the the beep .
10539	Yeah ,
10540	but for example if it is lost in your armchair , we will not see the flash .
10541	You wo not be able to find it .
10542	Yeah .
10543	And flash takes up a lot of batteries again .
10544	Yeah , it is true ,
10545	but it is it is only has to do so when you press the button that it is lost .
10546	Just
10547	And LED on it .
10548	Yeah .
10549	We could make a combination that it goes beep and that you that some light lights up .
10550	So .
10551	deaf people ?
10552	I have another idea , I am not sure if it is possible .
10553	Yeah ,
10554	I thought about for deaf people for example ,
10555	so .
10556	We could do that .
10557	Just a light on it
10558	or
10559	Very important .
10560	let is see .
10561	So we have the basic channels we have got here ,
10562	the power button somewhere over here ?
10563	I usually press it on top .
10564	Oh yeah , it is true .
10565	that thing should be central .
10566	You should not be
10567	you should not press it by accident ,
10568	but it should not be stacked away somewhere .
10569	Oh ,
10570	that is It is
10571	And But you r
10572	And you are reading from the t
10573	you always read from the top to the the bottom of it .
10574	At least that is what I am accustomed to .
10575	Yeah .
10576	Yeah ,
10577	like that is going to work .
10578	What would you like to ?
10579	Okay ,
10580	mute button .
10581	Yeah ,
10582	I thought maybe we should move the buttons down and put it here for example
10583	to
10584	From top to bottom .
10585	Yeah , that is true ,
10586	you should
10587	I think the bu the power button should be on top ,
10588	cause it is the first thing you do , turn it on .
10589	Yeah ,
10590	so it is
10591	Yeah .
10592	So power button on top .
10593	Mute .
10594	Is that somewhere here ?
10595	Is that used often ?
10596	The mute button ?
10597	Do people use that often ?
10598	Cause I am pretty much accustomed to it right over here , at least in general ,
10599	but
10600	It is not that important , no .
10601	Do we hardly
10602	I think it should be at the bottom somewhere .
10603	So i it is
10604	sorry ?
10605	No , it is no .
10606	Mute .
10607	Turn the sound off .
10608	I do not think it is important ,
10609	but I think it I think it should be you c
10610	you could put it somewhere here .
10611	Or or with the volume selection .
10612	No ,
10613	because it
10614	Yeah ,
10615	people are accustomed to that ,
10616	it is
10617	Can I have that ?
10618	That is j
10619	Take this out and here see
10620	are we going to take triangles anyway ?
10621	I am drawing triangles , but
10622	Yeah ,
10623	it is maybe a bigger lesser than thing .
10624	Around not not at top at the around the volume selection .
10625	I do not know where exactly ,
10626	but Wha
10627	No .
10628	Sure .
10629	That is pretty much what people are accustomed to ,
10630	are not they ?
10631	Well ,
10632	I am accustomed to the channels being on top .
10633	So anyway ,
10634	I think this is should be the channels
10635	and or sh
10636	Here ,
10637	okay .
10638	Yeah .
10639	Yeah , me too .
10640	Yeah , that is better .
10641	Okay ,
10642	should we chan
10643	okay ,
10644	this two , channel up and down .
10645	On the right .
10646	Shall we also look if it is possible to make a rechargeable remote ?
10647	That you do not have to buy new batteries if every
10648	, yeah .
10649	Yeah .
10650	Well ,
10651	for that is it is
10652	on one part it is it is a good thing to recharge it
10653	Maybe we should what
10654	what could be possible is one with rechargeable batteries for example .
10655	Maybe it is more ex expensive .
10656	You have
10657	just put Penlite batteries that are rechargeable ,
10658	because it is an it is
10659	it is it is very annoying .
10660	But that is already possible .
10661	But is not that expensive in the entire package ?
10662	But again , is not that too expensive ?
10663	Cause that means that we have to implement rechargeable batteries , a docking station
10664	And do people actually want that ?
10665	To pay extra they want to pay for rechargeable ?
10666	Can can we save this or
10667	Yeah .
10668	Yeah .
10669	I am not sure y I am not sure it is if it is expensive ,
10670	but just take a look at it ,
10671	because it might be a very good idea .
10672	Because if it is it is useful to have it rechargeable , but at the same time , if you do not want recha if you forgot to recharge it
10673	and you want to watch TV now , you want to be able to put different batteries in it , use it now and not in half an hour .
10674	Yes .
10675	Yes .
10676	Okay .
10677	you could make a device , but I am not sure how that is possible with the costs , that you can put in normal batteries , rechargeable ,
10678	but it you are
10679	the remote also can act as a recharger .
10680	I think I have a nice idea .
10681	So then you can choose , you have every decision .
10682	Know what I mean ?
10683	You can put in normal Penlites , rechargeable Penlites , but they can also be recharged with the remote , with a wire .
10684	Not exactly .
10685	Yeah yeah .
10686	I think it is it is a pretty good idea
10687	to have like sort of a maybe a base station that you put on the TV .
10688	So but
10689	But I think that will cost a lot .
10690	Yeah ,
10691	that is g
10692	But Which
10693	Yeah .
10694	Could be flat , you could insert your remote into it .
10695	a normal wire would be better .
10696	I am not sure .
10697	Like a like a PDA , a hand held .
10698	A what ?
10699	Well ,
10700	we were talking about the fact that we wanted to insert either a beep or a flash into the thing with a little separate signal
10701	or
10702	So you could put that on a TV for example .
10703	You can just put it in the electricity and it charges itself , you do not need basic station .
10704	Yes .
10705	That is possible , that is true .
10706	It could be very flat , could be very small .
10707	It is a very small
10708	Yeah ,
10709	I am drawing it big now ,
10710	but
10711	So you can put your remote on flat for example .
10712	And at the backside of remote just just just a little hole for example you just put it down , it recharges for example .
10713	Yeah .
10714	Yeah .
10715	I do not think it is very expensive .
10716	Yeah .
10717	I am not sure if it costs a lot ,
10718	that that is what he r
10719	That is that you
10720	that is what you buy yourself .
10721	Yes .
10722	I am going to try to find that out .
10723	I am not sure if there is information available on this ,
10724	but
10725	It is just an idea ,
10726	we have to find out if it is possible .
10727	But
10728	Yeah , they want to pay for it .
10729	Do they want
10730	but they want a rechargeable one ?
10731	I am not sure ,
10732	you should find out if it is if rechargeable is important .
10733	Yeah .
10734	Th there was not a el ask esque
10735	But
10736	But f
10737	Yeah .
10738	These are comfort issues .
10739	So I think people will pay they wanted to pay for comfort .
10740	Well ,
10741	this is comfort .
10742	They want to pay for comfort ,
10743	we just assu we
10744	we could either make a separate station which just sends a signal to the remote control to either beep or flash to find it ,
10745	and Yeah ,
10746	we have to either that or make it integrated with a with a docking station .
10747	Yes .
10748	Yeah .
10749	Exactly .
10750	I think this is a brilliant product .
10751	I would buy it myself .
10752	I think it would be good actually .
10753	I like the beep part anyway .
10754	So
10755	let is go through the
10756	Covers is covers is good .
10757	I like the covers .
10758	That is a brilliant idea .
10759	I never thought
10760	I hope if I have information about that ,
10761	I am going to
10762	Yeah ,
10763	it is
10764	Oh
10765	we can save this .
10766	Up and saved .
10767	We even saved the ant .
10768	Okay .
10769	So
10770	what we have is you have
10771	I think you have to do a lot of work on if it is possible for the cost .
10772	Maybe
10773	yeah ,
10774	or maybe you can find out i what people are willing to pay .
10775	Yeah .
10776	We are going for twenty five Euros sales price ,
10777	but just try to find out what they are willing to pay for it , because if they are willing to pay more , we could lose a little profit and maybe attract more customers ,
10778	we just have to see what it looks like .
10779	Yeah , okay .
10780	Yeah
10781	yeah
10782	yeah .
10783	Yeah .
10784	Yeah .
10785	I would like to make a decision .
10786	What it costs and what kind of materials that we can choose what we want in it
10787	and
10788	exactly , I need it .
10789	Yeah , if you have some financial information that that would be nice ,
10790	so .
10791	Could you post some other essentials of what people want ,
10792	so that I can work with some buttons , where to put it You seem to have information on that , I would like to see some of it .
10793	Yeah .
10794	Was it not possible to send emails around the office ?
10795	Not .
10796	No , it was not was not allo
10797	it was possible , not allowed ,
10798	so .
10799	No , it is not .
10800	No .
10801	So that is why I am not sure that you are allowed to share documents on the on the draft .
10802	Yeah .
10803	My computer crashed ,
10804	so
10805	I lost my presentation ,
10806	but I have the
10807	Yeah ,
10808	but I
10809	Here I have the the s the homepage of our internet ,
10810	and here is my
10811	here is my marketing report ,
10812	maybe you ca you can look at that
10813	and
10814	yeah .
10815	Yeah , okay .
10816	I do not care .
10817	I have not heard any complaints yet ,
10818	so .
10819	Oh , your computer .
10820	Okay .
10821	Yeah ,
10822	the oh , they inc
10823	they include the new one .
10824	Well ,
10825	I have your PowerPoint presentation , I can get some inf information out of that .
10826	Let is see .
10827	Or just for you .
10828	Oh ,
10829	where would we
10830	Where would we want the teletext button ?
10831	Because we decided that it is n not that important .
10832	Oh
10833	no , I did not have that .
10834	And one And wha what people want
10835	, I have
10836	I have another thing
10837	Yeah .
10838	All it tells just let is make make a new
10839	tick the new one .
10840	Do we put it somewhere over here ?
10841	Or maybe this is something for the next meeting ,
10842	I can draw out some ideas .
10843	other side .
10844	Yeah ,
10845	let is increase it a little
10846	because
10847	Yeah ,
10848	draw us up some some designs of of possible just keep in mind that the important buttons should be on top and either big ,
10849	so the more less important
10850	More or less .
10851	Yeah .
10852	Well ,
10853	we have decided more or less the basic structure .
10854	I can put the other buttons in
10855	Yeah .
10856	Just play a little with this ,
10857	put l
10858	shift a little up or down and we will see what looks best .
10859	What what did you want to say ?
10860	Or just po post your designs from time to time on the product share .
10861	what I al already said is the the the remote controls are always lost , but it it is also for people , they want to learn it fast ,
10862	not they want to
10863	No
10864	It is
10865	yeah ,
10866	it is easy to learn
10867	wi and And
10868	The If If
10869	Another thing I want to say is that we are looking at the market for the age younger than forty .
10870	Yeah .
10871	Maybe another idea .
10872	Yeah , so
10873	we do not want we want very little buttons , just the buttons you use a lot .
10874	Yes ,
10875	but it should cover all the functions ,
10876	so possibly , just an idea that popped in
10877	Yeah ,
10878	but we could go a step further ,
10879	because some TVs have the possibility to adjust brightness , that kind of menus .
10880	Well
10881	what
10882	we had function that what people do ,
10883	so .
10884	People change channels , people they change the volume and they they change channel , they turn TV off and on , for example .
10885	That is the basic fu
10886	that is what you do I am not sure who present that again , but those are the basic function that people use it for ,
10887	so those should be very well represented .
10888	That is true ,
10889	but that is what we stick under the menu button .
10890	Everything is
10891	you say in every TV that is configured under the menu .
10892	Yes ,
10893	but it Because we are making
10894	We need to adjust to the technology .
10895	But that is the question ,
10896	is it ?
10897	Because it needs to be configured in the television under the menu .
10898	Yeah , but
10899	But I think most modern TVs have it in their menu .
10900	If it is not , then we cannot reach it .
10901	I think so too .
10902	I think so too .
10903	True .
10904	is not there a possibility to do research on that , so we know that for sure ?
10905	If you rule out functions , then and that gets known , then people are not going to buy it .
10906	Then the consumer bond or something says you cannot do this and that with it .
10907	No , I thi
10908	Oh , we are not going to be able to sell it for twenty five then , with an LCD screen .
10909	That is a bad bad com commercial
10910	for
10911	okay .
10912	we will we will see what we can come up with .
10913	Under forty .
10914	Yeah ? .
10915	That is true .
10916	on my report , I did not ish I did not show it in my presentation , because my computer crashed .
10917	Yeah yeah .
10918	they want to pay for an LCD screen and speech recognition .
10919	The want to pay for
10920	Oh .
10921	So
10922	i
10923	yeah .
10924	Did they really said it like that ?
10925	Those two things .
10926	Yeah ,
10927	and
10928	Yeah .
10929	Do they realise how much that costs ?
10930	That is almost undoable .
10931	shall we ?
10932	Younger , age sixteen and forty five .
10933	but If if they
10934	So
10935	we can
10936	We can look at the possibilities for an LCD
10937	and
10938	I dunno .
10939	That is all here ,
10940	here it says
10941	Yeah ,
10942	age sixteen forty fi interest in main features more critical .
10943	No ,
10944	that is that is .
10945	Even if i if we have this lost unit , then we cannot do it for that price .
10946	Okay , so
10947	we are not focusing on this .
10948	All the interest in features , not really the LC
10949	oh
10950	here .
10951	Would you pay for speech recognition in a remote control .
10952	, okay ?
10953	Speech recognition is quite
10954	Yeah , just look at the possibilities then ,
10955	because if
10956	apparently it is what people want , it is supposed to be a luxurious remote , maybe it is not even that expensive .
10957	Yeah , that is true .
10958	Yeah .
10959	How much it will cost
10960	and It will come
10961	Yeah .
10962	Or find a compromise , maybe just a black and white or for some extra information on it , on your programmes .
10963	I
10964	But I really need finance information .
10965	Well
10966	I doubt it ,
10967	but
10968	Well ,
10969	I had basically
10970	Something like this .
10971	Me too .
10972	I mean we all do .
10973	We all do .
10974	Right .
10975	I think it is something we should put into consideration .
10976	Apparently it is what people want ,
10977	so .
10978	We should see if what it costs , if it is possible .
10979	Yeah .
10980	Yeah ,
10981	we should do a little thing about design ,
10982	because it looks boring really to me .
10983	Even if you put it even if you put a different cover on it , it looks still looks boring ,
10984	so .
10985	Different colours maybe .
10986	And the design , it should differ .
10987	But all
10988	Okay .
10989	This is Philips ,
10990	huh ?
10991	Philips has this .
10992	I have no clue .
10993	I just drew something what which would fit into your hand easily .
10994	Okay .
10995	To make it kind of futuristic .
10996	Oh ,
10997	I realise if we make it small , then it needs to be a little thicker ,
10998	because I need to put all the electronics in it .
10999	I think it is a very
11000	Sorry ?
11001	Yeah ?
11002	Okay .
11003	If we make it s smaller , less wide , then we need to m make it a little thicker ,
11004	because I have to put all the electronics in it .
11005	Yeah ,
11006	but you have to j just keep in mind it should not be too heavy .
11007	I mean we can stick it in in there , I think .
11008	No .
11009	Huh
11010	even if in the worst case we can even
11011	Could you give me the pen back ?
11012	So
11013	let is say that people would want an LCD thing .
11014	So
11015	what kind of
11016	Yeah , sure .
11017	Let is take take the basic design again , what we oh , crap came up with .
11018	I will just make it a little bigger now .
11019	So
11020	a transmitter here .
11021	Anyway .
11022	We could
11023	let is say we have an LCD screen , people want an LCD screen .
11024	So then we should probably put it here .
11025	It does not have to be really big , but just just have to be has to be there .
11026	Think it is a good place ,
11027	people do not
11028	No ?
11029	It is not that it is not the most important function , it is just an extra thing ,
11030	it just
11031	you press the buttons on top , because your finger is on top .
11032	If you are reading from top to bottom , I think it is better to put it at the top .
11033	Me too .
11034	It is j
11035	but .
11036	But i if you if you are going to put the LCD on it , I think it is very important to use it ,
11037	because it is use it But nee the function of it .
11038	How can you use an LCD screen ?
11039	Yeah ,
11040	but why
11041	I I am not sure .
11042	So you can use it maximum , because it is a lot it costs a lot .
11043	So
11044	Yeah .
11045	Now it is pretty much tucked away in your hand .
11046	if you t if you press a button , you can see it ,
11047	ri I am not sure wha
11048	I am trying to imagine myself what it would look like .
11049	No .
11050	M
11051	I personally would prefer it on the top .
11052	I am
11053	I am still not convinced of the
11054	Yeah .
11055	You would prefer it
11056	n
11057	Okay .
11058	Huh .
11059	So we have three people saying it should be on top .
11060	Okay ,
11061	but then you would would s have to stack away your buttons somewhere else .
11062	But it
11063	Anyways .
11064	It is expensive to build it ,
11065	so
11066	you must use the maximum of it .
11067	this looks a little
11068	About the LCDs thing .
11069	Well if it if it is
11070	if it is possible wi if it is not too expensive , we should include it ,
11071	because it is it is cool .
11072	They want it .
11073	We should just try to make that if it is possible .
11074	If it is possible we should really do it ,
11075	but we need that information .
11076	Huh .
11077	Also keep in mind again , the LCD screen is very flat , but it needs transistors , resistors , I do not know what more and that needs space .
11078	But
11079	Yeah , I know .
11080	So I have to look if that is possible .
11081	But if we
11082	So basically
11083	can I
11084	what we have to decide now is what goes on top .
11085	we have green now
11086	Or maybe we should m we could draw draw something a bit that has it on on on the bottom .
11087	Do we put the volume control and the channel control here ,
11088	or do we put it on he
11089	Would we like to press it in the middle ?
11090	Yes ,
11091	but we do agree that we keep this at the centre ,
11092	because it is basically the most important function .
11093	In middle of it .
11094	In the middle .
11095	Maybe in a circle for example , like we like in this example .
11096	I think this is not good ,
11097	but for
11098	we could make circular buttons for example .
11099	For up and down , ma make it a circle on it ,
11100	because it
11101	I think the channel button should be in the centre .
11102	Yeah .
11103	It is the most import
11104	yeah .
11105	Channel button should be st stick together , for example here in this section .
11106	Because it is
11107	We are not sure about the size anyway ,
11108	just a general design .
11109	Well ,
11110	that would make them quite small .
11111	So maybe you would put them here .
11112	You can make it as big as you want .
11113	For example if you take
11114	No ,
11115	let is see .
11116	Yes , but a big remote control probably not something which people would like .
11117	For example just
11118	Yeah .
11119	If we have a a space issue , we can also lose one battery .
11120	It is rechargeable ,
11121	so we can stick with one instead of two .
11122	That might be an option .
11123	I do not think if we if we even use an LCD screen , we need to , definitely .
11124	Yeah ,
11125	but if we need two batteries and an LCD screen , that means a lot of space that we need .
11126	Yeah ,
11127	but we have to see what the si what the size is .
11128	But it has to be a little bit heavier .
11129	Okay .
11130	The LCD does not have to nee does not need to be very big .
11131	No ,
11132	but the things behind it .
11133	space .
11134	let is see .
11135	Like a process .
11136	Finish meeting now .
11137	It is on your computer .
11138	Finish meeting now .
11139	Okay , we will .
11140	So
11141	would we like this
11142	or would we like the
11143	Let is see what we have here .
11144	So either
11145	We either we have to decide what what people want .
11146	I like this one more .
11147	Either this one ,
11148	this this could be the luxurious one .
11149	So we have channel buttons here .
11150	I am just drawing something .
11151	I think this would this would look cool .
11152	You could have it for example small buttons here for some extra functions ,
11153	so if your basic function is here , we should like we decided before , programmes up and down , and volume here .
11154	Or
11155	And what about speech recognition
11156	Yeah , yeah ,
11157	but or
11158	or an LCD or an speech .
11159	Well
11160	you can just
11161	no , I am not sure if we can do that ,
11162	but we could put a microphone in here for example .
11163	I think it is LCD is better now .
11164	Just to do research into both , w what it costs and what it takes for space .
11165	Yeah .
11166	I will try to .
11167	Yeah .
11168	But let is cut the meeting for now yes .
11169	One more thing I would like to say ,
11170	let is give this a name , and not like some vague serial number that no one understands , like with cars .
11171	Okay .
11172	Yeah , okay ,
11173	yeah ,
11174	that is
11175	yeah , that is okay .
11176	Shall we all try to think about a name ?
11177	Good luck .
11178	So I think of a name .
11179	Yeah , let is think of a name , okay .
11180	okay .
11181	Oh , good .
11182	Okay , at anyways ,
11183	the the minutes will be on the on the web shortly ,
11184	so there we go .
11185	So
11186	Yes ,
11187	go and finish up
11188	and I will see you at lunch .
11189	Yeah .
11190	Same .
11191	Yeah , I have
11192	 
11193	Did you manage ?
11194	Okay .
11195	Yeah , sh not quite .
11196	You will see
11197	Woah .
11198	Hello .
11199	Hello .
11200	So ,
11201	are you d
11202	what were j you guys discussing ?
11203	Okay .
11204	No ,
11205	just ask if if he could manage .
11206	Yeah .
11207	Did you find anything new ?
11208	nothing special .
11209	Yeah , the for the trendy stuff .
11210	I have a lot of new information .
11211	Great , great .
11212	A little bit .
11213	Come on .
11214	I now will show it .
11215	Hey ,
11216	everything alright .
11217	Well ,
11218	I had just a little bit of time , so I hope it is something we can work with .
11219	Did you manage ?
11220	Okay .
11221	Okay .
11222	What is here .
11223	But
11224	Well ,
11225	I heard that there was a new component speech recognition component , which was pretty much up to standard ,
11226	so we might use that
11227	I put that in my drawing , but again I did not not have that much time .
11228	Yeah ,
11229	I had the same .
11230	It just shuts itself down
11231	and
11232	Oh .
11233	Do you have a lot of new information ?
11234	Do you have a lot of new information ?
11235	That is true .
11236	And there we are .
11237	Huh .
11238	So
11239	Okay ,
11240	that is just super .
11241	Alright .
11242	I have a lot of new information .
11243	What the f
11244	oh , yeah .
11245	I have a complete list of everything that we can use , all the components that all av available .
11246	It does not do what I want it
11247	Okay fine ,
11248	that is too bad .
11249	I have no
11250	I still do not have any finance information , but at least we have a lot more to go on now
11251	Yep , that is right .
11252	Let me just
11253	You need to start it up first ?
11254	Okay .
11255	Yeah , I have to start our
11256	Kay .
11257	Okay ,
11258	go again .
11259	Well
11260	second phase , conceptual design .
11261	It is fine , everybody knows what we are talking about .
11262	So ,
11263	take you past the minutes of last meeting again .
11264	Yep .
11265	Again you get your three presentate to see what you came up with .
11266	So
11267	too bad we do not have any finance information apparently .
11268	So that is too bad .
11269	So then we will just have to d have to go on , you know , the information that we have to make the make final decisions on on a conceptual design .
11270	So Here we go .
11271	Anyway ,
11272	last w last w
11273	what discussed last time , you all remember that , that we have to keep the electronics size in mind .
11274	Same goes for you .
11275	We have to have an easy design with big buttons which are durable and there are people actually spen willing to spend money to do to get more features and among those features LCD screen and voice recognition are very popular .
11276	So we have to make a move on that area , I guess .
11277	S
11278	especially s when when the new component is applicable in our product , we will be fine .
11279	Anyways , well
11280	teletext was not important and that is what I took .
11281	And the consumer ,
11282	yeah ,
11283	we aim for young consumers ,
11284	so that is fine .
11285	And well actually we
11286	yeah ,
11287	we did need some more data on finances , but w
11288	yeah
11289	we still do not have that apparently .
11290	uh huh .
11291	That is too bad .
11292	Yeah ,
11293	we need to im de
11294	we are going to implement the beep and the flash thing to recover your remote .
11295	So
11296	one of these interchangeable covers apparently which will make it a more fashionable product .
11297	So anyway .
11298	Guess we will have to do this after the after the you give your presentations .
11299	So
11300	I will just close this one now ,
11301	and let is let is see , .
11302	Okay ,
11303	what t
11304	Okay , yeah .
11305	I bet
11306	Oh okay .
11307	We have a lot to tell .
11308	You had a lot to go on .
11309	So
11310	how about you go first .
11311	Let is see where my presentation is .
11312	Okay ,
11313	this I mentioned before .
11314	Every feature for our remote control needs to have their own operating electronic devices .
11315	We need to take care of that .
11316	Then warning , there has to be a chip in our remote control .
11317	And the chip requirements needed for a normal button is just a simple chip , scroll wheel , and LCD is an advanced .
11318	Of course this is more expensive than this .
11319	So we have to decide on that in a minute .
11320	Okay .
11321	The available components for energy are , we have a basic battery , a hand an dynamo , like in old torches .
11322	We have a kin kinetic provision , then you have to shake the remote control to get the energy .
11323	And we have solar cells .
11324	I suggest that we decide on that one immediately .
11325	Then I have all lists .
11326	So
11327	My personal fav favourite is the kinetic provision
11328	because I ha
11329	I think so , yes .
11330	Yeah .
11331	Does it provide enough energy ?
11332	Also if if we were choose the the LCD option , would it give enough energy
11333	Okay ,
11334	that is the just assume it takes .
11335	Yes .
11336	Yes .
11337	Because I had the information you take the remote control , you pick it up at least two times a day .
11338	So then it is already shaken and gives energy .
11339	Well ,
11340	I am not sure if it is shaken enough ,
11341	because
11342	No , I do not think so ,
11343	because watches can go on kinetic energy because they move all the time .
11344	Is that enough ?
11345	Because I do not really see people shaking their remote control before using it .
11346	Or Think
11347	But I am sure t
11348	I mean remotes lie
11349	still I think like ninety nine percent of the time .
11350	So I do not think that is
11351	a really good
11352	the other alternative were solar cells .
11353	I do not think that is applicable
11354	because I thin why
11355	why should not we take a basic battery ?
11356	Why not ?
11357	I mean everybody everybody knows how to use that .
11358	Other options are solar cells , hand dynamo and basic battery .
11359	No .
11360	And what does the hand dynamo
11361	oh , sorry .
11362	A rechargeable maybe .
11363	Only basic battery ?
11364	Okay ,
11365	but I think this is not a r .
11366	Re rechargeable basi
11367	Yeah .
11368	It is it is common .
11369	So
11370	and it is available everywhere .
11371	Yeah .
11372	So why sh I think better .
11373	Yeah ,
11374	but I think this rules out our unit our rechargeable unit .
11375	This is really a really basic battery , a normal battery .
11376	Yeah ,
11377	but it is
11378	Yeah ,
11379	it was not it was not in the options , a rechargeable m module actually .
11380	Oh .
11381	Huh ?
11382	Okay ,
11383	that is .
11384	Okay ?
11385	Okay ,
11386	but then we do not offer a re chargement function .
11387	Okay yeah ,
11388	b you c
11389	of course you could place re re chargeable batteries .
11390	Yep .
11391	Basic .
11392	But that is up to the consumer himself .
11393	So
11394	Well ,
11395	it is not in the list .
11396	That is what it says .
11397	So we cannot choose from it .
11398	So
11399	Okay , will just take regular batteries .
11400	Exactly .
11401	Alright .
11402	Right .
11403	Yep .
11404	Okay .
11405	Next one is curving .
11406	we can make a model that has one curve , two or three .
11407	And
11408	th the shape .
11409	Curves being ?
11410	Of the remote control itself ,
11411	okay .
11412	Of course the more curves the more expensive .
11413	Okay .
11414	Exactly .
11415	But But It dep
11416	But
11417	Yeah .
11418	Yes .
11419	I was thinking along the line of one curve .
11420	I will show that in my design .
11421	Okay , we will get back on that later .
11422	So
11423	we will get back to that .
11424	Just
11425	But what were the implications if you if put more curves it
11426	it is gets more expensive .
11427	I think one curve is fine .
11428	Yeah .
11429	Depends on the user .
11430	More expensive .
11431	Okay ,
11432	so I think with with the extras that we had there
11433	it is two curves I suppose .
11434	More difficult to make .
11435	Exactly .
11436	Okay .
11437	And I believe even that the r the number of options we have on putting things in it goes down with
11438	exactly .
11439	Also decreases , okay .
11440	Material .
11441	I have to offer a plastic , rubber , wood or titanium .
11442	if we choose plastic , we cannot choose solar cells for energy .
11443	If we choose titanium , we cannot use more than one curve .
11444	Okay .
11445	But we do not have that so fast .
11446	More than one curve , yeah
11447	okay .
11448	Okay ,
11449	I t
11450	I would go for plastic
11451	because I have a couple of curves in my design .
11452	We will just go Cause it
11453	yeah ,
11454	I am not sure .
11455	Yeah .
11456	Well ,
11457	g
11458	let is just get back to that .
11459	We will discuss that later .
11460	Okay ,
11461	we have
11462	so I think we can rule out
11463	I am not sure we can rule anything out .
11464	Yeah .
11465	Okay .
11466	We will do that when y when you get your design .
11467	No .
11468	But I think wood is not an option either .
11469	No , wood is not an option .
11470	No , wood i wood is not an option .
11471	No .
11472	Well
11473	it it is stylish ,
11474	but we can
11475	yeah ,
11476	but you can change your covers anyway .
11477	Okay .
11478	No .
11479	Okay .
11480	My personal thought was rubber
11481	because I had an email , I believe it was from you , f against falling .
11482	Yeah ,
11483	is it keep in mind that it it is it is it fal
11484	remote controls fall a lot on the ground .
11485	So you do not want it to break .
11486	So either have rubber edges or a rubber remote control is very durable .
11487	Okay .
11488	But
11489	Continue .
11490	Yeah ,
11491	but it does not have to be unbreakable ,
11492	because we do need to keep selling these thing
11493	Okay , well
11494	that that is definitely true .
11495	No .
11496	Do not have to be un breakable ,
11497	it is p it is a
11498	it is not supposed to ju
11499	yeah
11500	, break after one use .
11501	Yeah .
11502	I mean it they
11503	they fall a lot .
11504	So
11505	Well ,
11506	you have for if you if
11507	for example if you take hard plastic .
11508	I think we have to decide on this anyway .
11509	because if we make removeable covers , it has to be one of those mat materials .
11510	We have no more than this .
11511	So
11512	Because it
11513	well ,
11514	ru
11515	will rubber actually protect the remote control itself ?
11516	Because it
11517	Yeah ,
11518	but then you buy a new cover .
11519	If it falls it might crack .
11520	And rubber kind of softens the fall .
11521	But rubber
11522	Okay .
11523	I am not sure if it is the it is the entire cover you change .
11524	, it is could be .
11525	Are are we focussi focussing on on the But
11526	But Not that
11527	but are we focussing on the younger people or the elder people ?
11528	Younger , okay .
11529	You know what ,
11530	th
11531	we are focusing very much on the covers now .
11532	I think it is just w now
11533	we are going for the basic design .
11534	If we want to expand our options , f be fashionable , then we can get changeable covers .
11535	But I think the basic thing
11536	let is just rule out wood for now and continue .
11537	Okay .
11538	We are definitely focussing on the younger people , cause that was our main goal .
11539	Yeah , that is okay .
11540	Nah , that is
11541	But But th the younger people
11542	my investigation turns out that the younger people want a little bit material that that is spongy
11543	and So A
11544	sc
11545	Yeah .
11546	Alright .
11547	Then I proceed ,
11548	but I need to know after this meeting .
11549	So
11550	Interface , I have four things to offer ,
11551	pu
11552	normal push buttons of course .
11553	Okay okay , we will .
11554	we have a lot of expertise on that one .
11555	We have a large history , our company , on push buttons .
11556	Scroll wheels , those can be pushed as well , although that is more expensive .
11557	liquid crystal colour display
11558	and
11559	What is this ?
11560	Okay ,
11561	and if we use rubber , I already mentioned that , we can only use rubber buttons .
11562	So rubber can only match with rubber .
11563	Which one of those are we going to use ?
11564	Evident .
11565	Yeah , o of course we are going to use .
11566	But I did not I did not go on the thought of a scroll wheel actually .
11567	Yeah ,
11568	of cour
11569	Yeah ,
11570	but there is a
11571	is it really necessary
11572	cause a normal push button can do that job .
11573	Huh .
11574	I am still deciding on what what what could you use it for .
11575	No .
11576	Maybe for volume control .
11577	I think the channels .
11578	Channel , I think that would be annoying
11579	because it might accidentally scroll onto another channel .
11580	Oh .
11581	Yeah .
11582	I think a push button for channel would be better .
11583	I mean it
11584	for volume control it is it is a smoother motion ,
11585	you can just increase or decrease .
11586	Huh ?
11587	Huh .
11588	But not sure .
11589	For channels will be good .
11590	But
11591	Huh ?
11592	Oh .
11593	I do not think so .
11594	I have not I have not taken it into consideration .
11595	so
11596	but it looks cool .
11597	I do not think we really need one .
11598	no .
11599	Oh .
11600	flashy and
11601	yeah .
11602	I think would be cool , scroll wheel .
11603	It is not that much
11604	if we take a normal scroll wheel without the pushing , then it is not expensive .
11605	We can do that .
11606	But why do we need it ?
11607	If we do not need it , why put it in your why put it in your in your if it is if it is not something people are looking for or is useful .
11608	Yeah ,
11609	but why would we use it ?
11610	Perhaps .
11611	Think .
11612	we do not need it , but it is it is design a design thing .
11613	Yeah ,
11614	you get
11615	No .
11616	I think they are looking for that .
11617	Of course we have a young target group .
11618	Are they ?
11619	Yeah ,
11620	but if it is if it is not useful ,
11621	I do not think it I do not think it gives an extra function to the remote .
11622	So they might find that attractive in a remote con
11623	Okay .
11624	Scroll wheel ?
11625	I do not know .
11626	Yeah , that is it .
11627	Anyway
11628	What you
11629	what
11630	what would you get on the LCD screen ?
11631	Is it expensive ?
11632	Does it
11633	And how much more expensive is that ?
11634	Or
11635	No absolute numbers ,
11636	but it is just more expensive and takes more room
11637	I suppose in your in your design .
11638	So push buttons we will use .
11639	LCD screen ?
11640	Is that s
11641	I only know that if we are using that , we need ano an advanced chip in it .
11642	I have t
11643	I have two different
11644	Okay .
11645	Yeah .
11646	And that is more expensive .
11647	I have no idea .
11648	I have no absolute numbers .
11649	I only have
11650	Yeah ,
11651	but I do not think room is really an issue .
11652	Do not think it is an issue , okay .
11653	Oh let is go for
11654	let is say because it is very hot in n our target group I think ,
11655	we should take it take it t to consideration to build an LCD screen in it .
11656	I have two designs , one including an LCD screen , wh which is basically the deluxe edition .
11657	For the future .
11658	Okay .
11659	Yeah .
11660	And then I also have a standard edition , which wi we can also choose to develop too .
11661	Which basically has the same functionality , but lacks the LCD screen .
11662	Yep
11663	Yep .
11664	Exactly .
11665	Okay .
11666	But we will
11667	Yep .
11668	We will pick a we will pick from
11669	we will just combine everything later .
11670	Okay .
11671	Electronics , the first one is the chip .
11672	that is no longer an option , it has to be an advanced one now .
11673	Cause we have the LCD screen .
11674	Then we have an infrared sender , I think that is basic , we cannot do without .
11675	Basically ,
11676	it
11677	Oh ,
11678	I got
11679	I got an email that it is relatively small .
11680	Otherwise it is not s a remote control .
11681	And we have the sample sensor and speaker , the voice recognition thing .
11682	Are we going to do that or not ?
11683	I only have relative information .
11684	Once again I was would ask you if it is expensive , but apparently you do not have any data .
11685	So Well
11686	what d what was exact what you got on the on the new component ?
11687	That is small .
11688	So we can implement it .
11689	Yes ,
11690	let me just Get back .
11691	So why why
11692	if it is small and we can imp why should not we ?
11693	And there is get your mar marketing report ?
11694	What was the last number of how many people were interested in voice recognition ?
11695	Although it is hard for different countries of course .
11696	Oh
11697	how did you
11698	That goes also for the scroll wheel , by the way .
11699	The most of them more than sixty percent .
11700	But you have to programme it yourself , I suppose , with your own voice .
11701	More than sixty percent of the people would like voice recognition .
11702	Yeah .
11703	Mean of seventy percent I think .
11704	I am
11705	I have to look it up .
11706	If it is small , if it is fits , if if people like it , why not ?
11707	So
11708	Yeah ,
11709	but we got some data on people that actually are int are interested in that , and I do not think a scroll wheel offers new functionality , whereas speech recognition and LCD screen do offer new functionality in your product .
11710	Yeah .
11711	But do not we have any w information about scroll wheel ?
11712	Scroll wheel .
11713	If people would like that .
11714	No .
11715	No ,
11716	only
11717	That is strange ,
11718	because that is the same story .
11719	It is it is not necessary like an LCD , but it is just it adds something to the design .
11720	I do not know .
11721	On the most spee
11722	But
11723	Yeah ,
11724	for the future .
11725	No
11726	Oh that is r
11727	But I think we now already have to implement an advanced chip .
11728	I think so ,
11729	because if I think we are specially w if you are going
11730	maybe if you have the two editions you want to want to give out , probably you have one with with speech recognition
11731	and
11732	Yeah ,
11733	hold on a minute .
11734	So it is m
11735	No ,
11736	but that is that is okay .
11737	Well ,
11738	they b
11739	they basically can have speech recognition .
11740	I mainly focused on the LCD aspect .
11741	Were were you
11742	we are finished ?
11743	Or
11744	Oh .
11745	Because if there is something that Cause have
11746	did you have all the materials ?
11747	Or everything that you desc
11748	Okay , so
11749	just just go for design for now .
11750	Cause you wanted to see them ,
11751	right ?
11752	So this is basically the deluxe edition .
11753	There is still time .
11754	Yes , this was the last MS .
11755	I have a clear picture .
11756	Just m have a seat for a second .
11757	We will combine everything after this .
11758	Why is it s why is it squared ?
11759	Why did you pick square ?
11760	Or not square , but why is it yeah , sharp corners .
11761	I j
11762	Why is it square ?
11763	It
11764	cause it is designy .
11765	It is basically it has some futuristic Potentially ,
11766	yeah .
11767	Yeah .
11768	I do not really know .
11769	But I just thought that in normal remote controls you have like smooth curves and this and that , and this is something new , this is something different , something fresh .
11770	People Ri
11771	So only r right handed .
11772	Looks like a Star Trek phaser .
11773	It is true .
11774	And basically what you can see here is that it has a little ,
11775	yeah ,
11776	let is say gap
11777	which you can put your finger in .
11778	Yeah .
11779	Or Okay , so
11780	just yeah ,
11781	you can rest it on your finger .
11782	So you can you can hold it really comfortable , that is basically the idea .
11783	Okay .
11784	But it but it is only right handed then .
11785	Not for the left .
11786	Or left hand .
11787	No ,
11788	it just
11789	it is a curve inside a thing .
11790	Or
11791	Where ?
11792	Wher
11793	Oh in the back , okay .
11794	I
11795	does not really matter .
11796	So
11797	It is on the back .
11798	As you can see , this is the remote control you ca not really see it that well , but this is the LCD screen .
11799	Oh yeah
11800	yeah .
11801	Okay .
11802	So just imagine it goes that way .
11803	Yeah , I think it is okay .
11804	Oh yeah
11805	yeah .
11806	Then you can see you can hold it in your left or in your right hand .
11807	Okay .
11808	Yeah .
11809	Yeah yeah .
11810	And I also made a quick image , cause I did not have that much time , of the standard edition
11811	which has basically the keys are pretty much the same .
11812	Yeah .
11813	I thought it
11814	Well
11815	it it is
11816	yeah .
11817	Keys are probably the n the number keys , I suppose .
11818	Yeah .
11819	I had to do this really fast .
11820	So excuse me for the inconvenience here ,
11821	but as you can see , the keys moved .
11822	Okay .
11823	Well ,
11824	you can work on the actual concept or actual design later with him .
11825	Yeah .
11826	So
11827	these are basically the two types we have .
11828	But
11829	Well ,
11830	I think what you have to keep in mind is that you are moving the the the number keys from the top .
11831	So if we were to select the LCD screen , the transmitter here , you can see the light
11832	i
11833	Well
11834	we can shift that .
11835	in the the simple design you have them at a top , and the complex design you have them at the bottom .
11836	So it would that would give us a totally different design .
11837	So which actually making a whole different product instead of two different models .
11838	I think it would be very expensive to produce two whole different products .
11839	So
11840	Yeah ,
11841	or for example , why did you pick the the numbers all the way below , and the and the channels and volume control
11842	Okay .
11843	But normally , as you can see there , we put the number buttons right on top .
11844	Whereas because we had the LCD screen here , we had to move them downward ,
11845	so what you could say is that
11846	Because these are basically the functions you use the most .
11847	So if you hold it in your hand like this , you put your finger in the gap ,
11848	this is the m most easy part .
11849	Bit .
11850	, I agree .
11851	For zapping ,
11852	cau
11853	because people are zapping most of the time .
11854	That is fine .
11855	Yeah .
11856	That is fine .
11857	Just as long as you tak took it into consideration what people would prefer .
11858	, okay
11859	if you all agree , I am fine with it .
11860	But
11861	Okay .
11862	Yeah .
11863	Okay .
11864	So
11865	that is pretty much ha which I had in mind .
11866	As you can see here , this can be spaced for extra keys ,
11867	which is the design thingys .
11868	No
11869	it
11870	maybe it is better to look what the people want .
11871	Yeah ,
11872	I think we will
11873	I think we are going towards the deluxe edition anyway ,
11874	because that seems to be what the people want .
11875	So I can show my investigation .
11876	Yeah , maybe it is better .
11877	But let is see what is what they want now .
11878	Yeah .
11879	Especially for young people .
11880	where is that ?
11881	Where is th
11882	Oh .
11883	That is mine .
11884	Yeah .
11885	No ,
11886	you should send it to the f to the folder first .
11887	I forgot that .
11888	Okay ,
11889	let is just assume we go to forty one .
11890	Okay ,
11891	now it must be there .
11892	Yeah , here it is .
11893	Oh yeah .
11894	Okay ,
11895	the investigation turns out that the most appear people want look and feel likes is the s the same as before , but it must be w a little bit fancier than the the look of it .
11896	the second important thing is the it must be technol technological innova vative .
11897	So that is the LCD screen is perfect , I think ,
11898	and not
11899	Yeah , tha that is very important .
11900	Speech recognition .
11901	And a third thing is
11902	yeah
11903	, it is should be easy to use ,
11904	so not not too much bu buttons and channel selection .
11905	I think that is what you showed is perfect .
11906	And what the pe young people want is in Paris and and in Milan it showed out that the fruit and vegetables are are trendy .
11907	Th they
11908	you s you see it in the clothes and everything .
11909	And the contrast of it , it must the the buttons must a little bit spongy material .
11910	So rubber , I think th that is the best .
11911	No .
11912	Then rubber would be the best as a material indeed .
11913	Yeah , I agree .
11914	No .
11915	I think so .
11916	So we are we were focussing on the younger people .
11917	If that is the
11918	It could be a c it could be a cover .
11919	Okay , agreement .
11920	Okay .
11921	So the elder , yeah , they wanted a little bit of wood in it
11922	and that is th that is not important now .
11923	Okay ,
11924	so we are definitely going for rubber .
11925	Yeah .
11926	But it is not .
11927	Yeah ,
11928	but
11929	Yeah .
11930	Our focus is the young audience .
11931	Let is just go
11932	Uh huh .
11933	So let is stick to that .
11934	Cause n I
11935	I
11936	I
11937	I thought it makes a young classic remote with
11938	Yeah ,
11939	that is why I I d decided With a fruit cover ov or something like that .
11940	Nah ,
11941	I think we are in this case you are losing the the focus on the young group , because we are that is what we are focussing on .
11942	So I think the spongy feel gives us rubber .
11943	Yeah ,
11944	apparently
11945	yeah ,
11946	maybe also
11947	yeah ,
11948	I tend to disagree with with with a sharp form .
11949	I suppose it basi if you are saying fruits and vegetables , maybe it is supposed to be a little little more round .
11950	Yeah ,
11951	in in form of an vegetable or an fruit , maybe .
11952	Yeah ,
11953	for exa
11954	maybe like like a pear or something .
11955	Yeah ,
11956	but that is just more a se a seasonal , a trend thing .
11957	And
11958	Oh ,
11959	where is your A trendy
11960	Here he here you can put a maybe it
11961	But
11962	Yeah .
11963	That is true .
11964	That is what we are doing .
11965	The idea now is is is that you can put a cover on it , for example , with fruit , like a shape or whatever .
11966	I think shape is is important ,
11967	because they s they really extend .
11968	But not
11969	cause a n next year it will it will be something completely different .
11970	Oh , that is true .
11971	And then you have your apple shaped remote control , which is not trendy anymore .
11972	So I think that is more something you can focus
11973	Well ,
11974	you can s
11975	What you can do is smooth the edges indeed .
11976	Yeah ,
11977	but now you have your your like your Star Trek phaser thing shaped control .
11978	So I I th
11979	the edges are really really sharp .
11980	I am not su
11981	Or maybe just make it make it up into into a low a smooth curve instead of just less sharp twist on the outside .
11982	But that will bring extra c expenses .
11983	All veg fruit and vegetables are round .
11984	So it is better
11985	Yeah .
11986	I think I think there needs to be a little
11987	I think it is too too sharp .
11988	The edges are too sharp .
11989	The bottom is fine of course if it is square .
11990	But maybe just th make the top a little round it off on the sides .
11991	So I mean y
11992	That would be two curves .
11993	But I think , according to my information , this would be two curves .
11994	Two ?
11995	But it But it is that
11996	that is for the comfort .
11997	We have one left and one right ,
11998	and that disables what was it again ?
11999	It is some it is something that we cannot do then .
12000	One cur
12001	you could also make the curve go through of course .
12002	But that would make make the top round .
12003	Well
12004	we have got we have got like one curve here .
12005	Okay ,
12006	that is not a problem .
12007	For the gap .
12008	That is only for the titanium .
12009	We do not have .
12010	And we could have one here .
12011	It is it is not for the trendy thing of it .
12012	No , no no no no .
12013	What I am just
12014	cause you mentioned that more curves the more expensive , so I am just taking that into account .
12015	Yeah ?
12016	Okay , yeah .
12017	Yes
12018	But let is see ,
12019	titanium would give us only one curve .
12020	Then w
12021	yeah ,
12022	but we do not have that .
12023	So
12024	but we are not d we are not using titanium .
12025	So we have We have no .
12026	So the no .
12027	Well
12028	we picked rubber ,
12029	right ?
12030	So basically what we can do is m make these edges a little bit less sharp .
12031	Right , we did .
12032	So
12033	Just doodle something on the board on the left .
12034	But they They th
12035	these wha are what they call the curves .
12036	We m form .
12037	But the problem then is that it will start to resemble m the remote controls as we have them today .
12038	We were looking at something fresh , something trendy
12039	Okay .
12040	Well actually ,
12041	we are setting ourselves apart from by technology alone actually .
12042	So that
12043	let is see what you are doing .
12044	This side , this side , this is how they count .
12045	Oh , okay .
12046	I do not think like that .
12047	Not not really the curves on the on the side of the remote .
12048	No no .
12049	This is what they what they mean .
12050	Okay ,
12051	so that is basically silly .
12052	Okay , that is not really a good .
12053	Okay ,
12054	now I of course now I understand why they have more like Why the curves decrease the the the size the electronics that can be inside .
12055	So Okay .
12056	I do not think the outside would be called as a curve really .
12057	Yeah .
12058	It is like this .
12059	I think it is for all the basic well , looking from the side anyway .
12060	Well ,
12061	if you see what
12062	I have to come up with some designs fast anyway .
12063	So
12064	Okay .
12065	But you can make if you want to use a fruit in in
12066	Hey , you
12067	You can make it like Like this .
12068	But is not the f the fruit like a cover thing ,
12069	because we
12070	No ,
12071	but
12072	But if we put that directly into the design , we limit ourselves extremely .
12073	Well ,
12074	you should not focus on the mostly on the covers ,
12075	because lot of things we came up with ,
12076	should not be too really too much should not be too focussed on the covers
12077	because it is kind of an idea of our own , but we are not sure if we can actually make that .
12078	Because it that is just for one seasonal trend .
12079	That is the one thing I am also afraid of with this one
12080	because it the edges are really they might stick out on the on the side for example .
12081	Well
12082	Oh .
12083	As a example .
12084	But I d
12085	If you have a basic design , a little m a little smaller on the on the s on the edges , you could put more covers on it , y one one with square or sharp corners if you want to .
12086	Okay ,
12087	so that is
12088	well ,
12089	that is probabl
12090	, you would just like it to go a little bit more like this .
12091	So
12092	M
12093	just round it off a little , I guess ,
12094	because so we have more options I suppose .
12095	I think so
12096	because it looks leaner
12097	and we should just go with that .
12098	Okay .
12099	Anyway , you have all the time in the world to make to make the final design in a minute with him .
12100	So So
12101	we decided on what
12102	what did you guys want to know again
12103	because this is
12104	anyway ,
12105	I will fire up my thing .
12106	So so
12107	we come to a decision .
12108	Did you present e everything you wanted to ?
12109	Okay .
12110	Yep .
12111	So
12112	I can qui
12113	oh .
12114	what the
12115	I can quickly make a conclusion of what we have decided so far .
12116	we still need to decide on a couple of things you you needed to know .
12117	Yeah .
12118	Okay , anyway .
12119	energy , we choose regular regular batteries .
12120	Yeah .
12121	The chip is advanced because we have the advanced features .
12122	The case , it will be the material will be rubber , suppose .
12123	Would not the b the design we talked about .
12124	user interface , type .
12125	Well
12126	I think we took all the components separately what we want .
12127	let is see
12128	supplements .
12129	I am not sure what they mean by that .
12130	Anyway ,
12131	apparently you guys , you should work together on the final design , both on internal and external design .
12132	So Yeah ,
12133	you should you should probably find out how the product will fall into the market ,
12134	how what is going to happen with the final design as we have it now .
12135	Yeah .
12136	So Yeah ,
12137	of course you have got your specific instruction as usual .
12138	Yeah
12139	And speech w recognition .
12140	So
12141	Wanna spend some more
12142	I think we are in a pretty much in agreement actually ,
12143	which is good .
12144	So
12145	Lef
12146	let is see ,
12147	where the pen go ?
12148	Here .
12149	Are we all in agreement about the , well , the primary structure of the of my design ?
12150	Except for the edges .
12151	Like the keys there .
12152	Yeah
12153	open your thing again .
12154	Let is see what if you can come up with anything new .
12155	I will just do a next one .
12156	So what would give us your ne your design would be
12157	the lights would be on top ,
12158	right ?
12159	one on each one on each side .
12160	Yeah .
12161	To create a kind of disco effect
12162	when you That was basically what w
12163	Light for the finding of the remote .
12164	Is it is it the lights for for finding the finding remote
12165	or lights that it that
12166	Yeah ,
12167	I think that should just be a simple LED or something .
12168	We can also use one light for showing that the signal is being sent .
12169	But
12170	So we have the teletext we have here , we have the mute .
12171	Like that
12172	that is not that important of course .
12173	It just like a matter of a a beep if you pre that you just know that that there is context .
12174	So I do not think that is super important .
12175	But .
12176	sh Oh .
12177	LCD screen .
12178	This is the on off button .
12179	Are we
12180	We Little voice Record and a
12181	no .
12182	Speech recognition ,
12183	I
12184	where did I imagine .
12185	I did that pretty much over here ,
12186	so that you could use it like this and speak to it .
12187	Then you have the extra keys for teletext , mute , two buttons which can be pretty much anything or nothing .
12188	We can also just not use them .
12189	Let is see ,
12190	I will just make
12191	One light here .
12192	Main controls and a key pad .
12193	Yeah .
12194	And just make it red now .
12195	But it could be any colour .
12196	So
12197	Okay , whatever .
12198	Will be fine .
12199	Fine , anyway .
12200	What do we have here ?
12201	M I will make it
12202	are we going to use square buttons or round ones actually ?
12203	Personally I would prefer round ones .
12204	Me too .
12205	Yeah ,
12206	but that would
12207	this was just in the design .
12208	Form of fruit .
12209	It is better .
12210	Because if you
12211	I had a square design .
12212	Yeah ,
12213	for
12214	Okay .
12215	So I had square buttons .
12216	But in that case the round buttons would be more appropriate .
12217	Okay ,
12218	I assume it for
12219	so we take a r take a round power button right here .
12220	Whatever .
12221	back to black .
12222	not too big though .
12223	See this would be good .
12224	let is see .
12225	Are these for any extra controls ?
12226	Okay .
12227	Yeah .
12228	The left one is teletext and the right one is mute .
12229	And these two buttons are or not necessary
12230	or
12231	Yeah , the triangles would be best indeed .
12232	Okay .
12233	If we go for for round buttons in general , do we want to the menu key in the middle to be round ?
12234	For example ,
12235	if you
12236	let is see ,
12237	put it this here .
12238	I think we will go with the triangles
12239	that
12240	Come on .
12241	Triangles are good .
12242	Yeah ,
12243	they are a little too big now .
12244	But
12245	Anyway ,
12246	okay .
12247	So
12248	do you want for example a round button in the middle or square one ?
12249	I am not sure ,
12250	I just just came up with it .
12251	I personally think that a round b button looks bit silly ,
12252	but
12253	Does everybody agree on that ?
12254	You prefer a round ?
12255	Okay .
12256	Yeah .
12257	This aligns nicely .
12258	So Okay .
12259	We will just take the take the round button , suppose .
12260	oh the square button ,
12261	sorry .
12262	Yep .
12263	I suppose so .
12264	I would prefer round .
12265	But does not matter , does not matter .
12266	Okay .
12267	That is not a big deal , think .
12268	So
12269	there is our numbers .
12270	Think we need an extra button here of course for
12271	yeah ,
12272	like you had for the higher numbers .
12273	And you could include a button here for the mute , I suppose .
12274	For something else ,
12275	just to mirror mirror the effect with this .
12276	Yeah , you can .
12277	But it but it is not necessary ,
12278	becau
12279	We could put our logo there .
12280	That is not necessary
12281	because it
12282	you can take this away ,
12283	but there it looks like there is a hole there , just to mirror the effect .
12284	Okay , so
12285	we have a few
12286	Nah ,
12287	I think it it would be nice to put the logo here , for example , if you have some buttons here .
12288	We could put a logo here
12289	because it is very always in your field of vision .
12290	And what about
12291	Oh .
12292	If you are watching it , the LCD screen , .
12293	What about a button for your favourite channel ?
12294	yeah .
12295	Oh
12296	that could be that b
12297	Well
12298	now it is getting a little bit too crowded up there .
12299	Well
12300	we could we could include either here or here , for example .
12301	With the extra controls .
12302	one one set
12303	Yeah ,
12304	you have to put it up
12305	One of the four .
12306	But you think here or here ?
12307	I know .
12308	So Is your
12309	So it can basically be the button down below or one of the four buttons up there .
12310	No ,
12311	we could put this one as favourite channel for exam
12312	What are these for ?
12313	Okay .
12314	Because
12315	One of the four is better , I suppose .
12316	, it is better than , I think .
12317	It is a favourite channel .
12318	What ?
12319	You are accustomed to eleven ?
12320	My
12321	okay , have it your way .
12322	What ?
12323	Nee ,
12324	one of the four
12325	It is better th
12326	Yeah .
12327	Because it is a little bit confusing to have twelve buttons down there , because you are only accustomed to eleven , I would say .
12328	I mean , think this looks rather like like there is something missing for example .
12329	Oh ,
12330	we still need an okay button .
12331	I mean why would not you include a
12332	cause there is a a piece of electronics under there anyway .
12333	So why not give it a function .
12334	Let is say I mean could be anything .
12335	Well ,
12336	you could also shift the two buttons to be nicely aligned .
12337	But th
12338	No , I do not think
12339	because this is a zero .
12340	But you want zero to be mis aligned with the rest .
12341	Anyway , so
12342	this is the basic design , we want to have on and off
12343	what are we missing ?
12344	If it looks
12345	Okay ,
12346	so we want the remote to be the s the side view actually ,
12347	what I am going to draw .
12348	Oh ,
12349	we are pretty much missing an okay button ,
12350	but we have a button up there which is still free .
12351	So
12352	Yeah , pretty much .
12353	So
12354	probably think you want the curve to be here .
12355	Just going to be sh
12356	Yeah .
12357	Want this straight or what ?
12358	Let is keep it at this .
12359	So it would be like this .
12360	Do we want something interesting with it
12361	or
12362	see .
12363	Would give us a light here .
12364	Maybe it is boring .
12365	You want it curved or what ?
12366	Maybe you want
12367	Should like this ?
12368	Will give us design problem
12369	because we have
12370	It can be curved .
12371	Well ,
12372	I think it looks better curved .
12373	But that is probably
12374	It can be curved ,
12375	because that
12376	yeah ,
12377	it is a little bit more trendy to be curved .
12378	Huh .
12379	It can be curved .
12380	Why ?
12381	Yeah .
12382	Yes .
12383	Okay ?
12384	I think so .
12385	That is why I asked you .
12386	Okay .
12387	So
12388	Oh crap .
12389	I would curve the whole actually .
12390	But it pretty much looks like a banana already .
12391	I would curve the whole .
12392	Like like it hangs over your hand a little bit .
12393	Then it will bounce and you do not drop it so easily .
12394	Yeah .
12395	Oh .
12396	Anyway , so
12397	you want to a little more like this ?
12398	And just s s
12399	Stop the curve here or continue it
12400	So we have our LCD screen .
12401	Yeah , something like that , yes .
12402	Uh huh .
12403	Yes , exactly .
12404	I think continue like that .
12405	Yep .
12406	Then there is also enough room for the electronics .
12407	Let is see .
12408	In Bana
12409	it is banana vision .
12410	Yeah .
12411	It is fruit .
12412	Yeah .
12413	Let is make it yellow then .
12414	Perfect .
12415	Maybe once we can make a special edition in according with Chiquita .
12416	Yeah , it is perfect .
12417	Yeah .
12418	So you have your LCD screen right here , suppose .
12419	that would make
12420	We use the colours now .
12421	But
12422	You got sponsor , now you get a free one with every pack of Chiquita .
12423	Have ourselves sponsored .
12424	but it is a good trade off for them if they can have their logo on it .
12425	So it would give the buttons here .
12426	Or they can design their own cover .
12427	They might want to be the first ones to
12428	Oh , perhaps they can use it .
12429	We could set up a a marketing agreement .
12430	I suppose I suppose we can put
12431	let is see .
12432	Yeah .
12433	I suppose we can put the batteries in here
12434	because it has the most space , for example .
12435	Or give a special edition
12436	with with
12437	Wo not that be a problem with the LCD screen ?
12438	Yeah ,
12439	but the LCD screen probably needs quite the chip .
12440	I do not think so because it is the biggest part of the of the
12441	Let is
12442	I think it is possible .
12443	I think this is possible .
12444	Okay .
12445	I think it is the best place
12446	yeah ,
12447	you could also put them here .
12448	Huh .
12449	But
12450	Okay ,
12451	so we put the batteries here .
12452	It does not matter .
12453	You can actually place a chip for the LCD screen and at the bottom , and and wire it .
12454	Does not matter .
12455	Okay , that is not a problem .
12456	Okay .
12457	Okay .
12458	That is fine .
12459	Yep .
12460	I think we get the idea .
12461	, any other com
12462	what
12463	what are we missing here ?
12464	Something
12465	a speech recognition .
12466	where do we want the microphone , for example , to be ?
12467	On the side or on the or , for example , on top ?
12468	Like here .
12469	Top ?
12470	W
12471	On there .
12472	Oh , basically
12473	the idea that I had was it to be pretty much in combination with the transmitter .
12474	I think on top .
12475	To be
12476	Okay ,
12477	I w thought maybe it is either be here or because it is mi it might interfere with the transmitter ,
12478	I am not sure .
12479	Cause you can talk to it like this .
12480	No .
12481	But
12482	Cause transmitter would be here .
12483	Well ,
12484	the email said it was a quite a small component .
12485	So I do not see that .
12486	Why
12487	once again , like you said , the component can be somewhere at the bottom while we wire the microphone up there .
12488	Anyway .
12489	yeah ,
12490	it could be either be here or make a double microphone .
12491	I would not mind .
12492	It is , I believe , also able to talk .
12493	It is able to talk to you .
12494	It is a
12495	Well ,
12496	the
12497	Yeah ,
12498	but do you actually need the remote talking back ?
12499	Beep .
12500	I have a sample sample sensor and the speaker sensor .
12501	A speaker sensor .
12502	the speaker sensor we already have , but s
12503	I do not know what they exactly mean by a sample sensor .
12504	Could it talk back ?
12505	Like g give confirmation or something .
12506	I think it can .
12507	I think if you have a a speech recognition component , then a s speaking component is not that hard to to put in either .
12508	I think so , it I think it could .
12509	Yeah .
12510	I mean it could be a
12511	all this stuff could be integrated into the LCD screen , which you could navigate with this , I suppose .
12512	Navigate through everything .
12513	If you have I think you sh
12514	I think the advanced options should be
12515	I think it sh the advanced option could also be integrated in the LCD screen , of course ,
12516	because you do not have to have a button for everything .
12517	But
12518	Yeah .
12519	You can just navigate through th m your menu that you have here for advanced options with this .
12520	Think that would be fine .
12521	So that is w m would be making use of the LCD screen .
12522	We already have a sound component , by the way , for the beep .
12523	So
12524	beep .
12525	Beep .
12526	Beep .
12527	, so
12528	the flashing of the beep , we have well anything .
12529	We could
12530	Yeah ,
12531	but you could put a speaker or something on on the side for example .
12532	At the back ,
12533	yeah .
12534	Like that .
12535	Or at the side .
12536	For
12537	how do you draw that again ?
12538	whatever , looks stupid .
12539	Which is .
12540	So what is basically edi the editi idea , sorry , now ?
12541	We need to stay here and work out that .
12542	I think this is pretty
12543	I think you have to stay here because we are supposed to five minutes to finish the meeting .
12544	I am not sure .
12545	Oh .
12546	I should be getting new information , I guess .
12547	Oh ,
12548	like my
12549	the info that I got was that you are we are going to work on our own because you are going to do the market market analysing
12550	I am supposed to do the little work on the year end report .
12551	Yep .
12552	So the project report .
12553	Okay .
12554	Okay ,
12555	I think we are
12556	everybody satisfied with the with the current design we have ?
12557	So we are s supposed to be rubber .
12558	Well ,
12559	I suppose we will
12560	Pretty much .
12561	Yes .
12562	, that is fine .
12563	I think
12564	well ,
12565	I think the the remote control is going to be black
12566	because we we forgot to talk about
12567	I mean the the company colours are important apparently .
12568	Round .
12569	Wh
12570	Why ?
12571	It is the colour of a
12572	But , the you
12573	The young people want a trendy remote control .
12574	So
12575	we have the logo up there .
12576	But we have
12577	any company logo .
12578	So are we going to
12579	base colour is black ?
12580	And yeah ,
12581	of course we could use yellow buttons or yellow navigation or whatever .
12582	We have
12583	yes ,
12584	but
12585	and yellow .
12586	I would change
12587	I would take a yellow remote control .
12588	Yellow
12589	but yellow control .
12590	It is
12591	Okay .
12592	To have it flashy ,
12593	to have it
12594	it is for young people .
12595	Yeah ,
12596	but when you use covers , it basically easier to have a n have a neutral colour on the base .
12597	Need do be different .
12598	Well ,
12599	do not do not stick yourself on the covers right now .
12600	But do not stick yourself on the cover
12601	because
12602	Nah .
12603	No ,
12604	we are designing the remote control now ,
12605	but taking that into consideration , it is better to have a neutral base colour than to have a flashy
12606	It is more trendy .
12607	But we need to be different .
12608	Yeah ,
12609	but the info .
12610	I think we should go with with the company colour
12611	because what specific info that I got from the project board .
12612	So I think we should go with that .
12613	They want something trendy .
12614	So colourful is
12615	Yeah .
12616	Huh .
12617	It is either black cover with yellow buttons or vice versa .
12618	And I would say take a yellow cover and black buttons .
12619	That is definitely true .
12620	I think we should th
12621	then take it take yellow .
12622	To be different .
12623	Take what you c yellow remote control .
12624	So
12625	let is see if if we can do the LED onto it .
12626	You have the basic colours , blue , green , red .
12627	oh .
12628	Yeah ,
12629	we have so many colours already .
12630	So Oh no ,
12631	that
12632	I think it is good thing to be different
12633	than
12634	Well .
12635	You know what ?
12636	I am not going to do this .
12637	Oh , it is okay .
12638	That is up to you guys .
12639	Yeah .
12640	You doodle a doodle us a nice nice design for for the next meeting ,
12641	we will be done .
12642	Colourful , you you
12643	Yep .
12644	I think we are all happy now .
12645	I still do not have my scroll wheel though .
12646	Yeah .
12647	Yeah .
12648	Stupid scroll wheel .
12649	that is
12650	Nah , that is true .
12651	Oh ,
12652	where would you like to put it ?
12653	you could use it for the channels and for the volume .
12654	Yeah .
12655	Kay
12656	I am not sure
12657	I really , I am no
12658	I have no clue what we could use the scroll wheel for .
12659	No , forget it .
12660	Oh yeah .
12661	But it is has no real added value .
12662	No look ,
12663	it
12664	No , that is not my point .
12665	You can may But scroll for a channel s selection or volume Ma
12666	Oh okay .
12667	It takes space , a lot of space .
12668	And it could
12669	I am not sure
12670	if it if it has no function , why even put it there ?
12671	And th that is just so much things that make it look flash
12672	I think channel selection would be annoying
12673	because it just c you could scroll past the channel
12674	or
12675	It is not because it is functional , but it is just to add to the design , to have it flashy .
12676	It it has no function , I agree .
12677	Yeah ,
12678	but if it has no function ,
12679	then
12680	Basically out .
12681	I agree .
12682	Oh ,
12683	so many things have no function , just design .
12684	Let is vote on it .
12685	Then we do not have to talk about it any longer .
12686	Oh okay .
12687	What do you want ?
12688	In or out ?
12689	Okay .
12690	I do not see the
12691	Do you have all your answers ?
12692	Okay .
12693	You are out of course .
12694	You are
12695	okay , clear .
12696	Out .
12697	No r no scroll wheel .
12698	Okay .
12699	I do not see anything missing really .
12700	Yeah ,
12701	we should
12702	too bad we do not have the finance .
12703	We could have
12704	Yeah ,
12705	it is
12706	I am not sure if we are if we are going to get finance anyway because I thought we cou
12707	I thought it was going to be an issue at the first time we started .
12708	I have all my answers , yes .
12709	I have to call this in a form .
12710	I thought it was going to be a cost issue which material we were going to take relative to the advanced chips or anything .
12711	There is
12712	I have one question .
12713	So you just do whatever you like and does not care what it costs .
12714	I only have one question with the material ,
12715	but I do not have information that .
12716	We have chosen rubber .
12717	I think we are
12718	rubber is not expensive .
12719	No ,
12720	but can we make yellow rubber ?
12721	I think so
12722	Okay .
12723	Definitely .
12724	You can make rubber in any colour .
12725	In any colour .
12726	So
12727	I mean you ca not make yellow titanium , but you can make yellow rubber .
12728	But we ha w
12729	we do not use our reco we removable cover ?
12730	No ,
12731	huh ?
12732	Maybe maybe later ,
12733	Okay .
12734	yeah
12735	we can make
12736	for example it is just something you can click on it
12737	like that is but it is not som not
12738	apparently that is not something we are working with in the basic design .
12739	So .
12740	Yeah , it could be .
12741	It can be done ,
12742	 
12743	Can I close this ?
12744	Oh , okay .
12745	we do not have any changes ,
12746	do we ?
12747	So no .
12748	There we go .
12749	Okay ,
12750	here we are again .
12751	Detailed design
12752	oh , come on .
12753	Well
12754	s
12755	Forgot to insert the minutes , but it is about the same thing we discussed before .
12756	Could open that anyway , think .
12757	Other design
12758	anyway , we took as we took w we took rubber as as the material last time .
12759	We also that you are just busy with it .
12760	Took the advanced chip to t implement the advanced features .
12761	Well ,
12762	we discussed the design , no sharp corners , we rounded it off , like you see on the other screen ,
12763	which is fine .
12764	we agreed that the colour should be b yellow and black .
12765	Yellow in the back because it is m trendy , more trendy than black anyway .
12766	So
12767	then we ca
12768	yeah .
12769	We agreed that we would implement both the LCD and speech recognition ,
12770	but I will get to that in a moment .
12771	Cause some changes in the finances have left us implications anyway .
12772	So so ,
12773	like I said , we had no insight in finances , no prices , but we have them now ,
12774	and it is bad .
12775	Anyway .
12776	We are
12777	Oh .
12778	Prototype presentation , well first you guys built the prototype .
12779	So
12780	you could could present that .
12781	But let is see what be handy to do .
12782	Nee no ,
12783	you just go ahead and present
12784	the w
12785	we will scrap it later
12786	because
12787	What ?
12788	Oh
12789	that is
12790	has not changed that much , huh ?
12791	I did not expect anyway .
12792	I think it is more or less the same as we had .
12793	It is basically what we agreed upon , but just a little bit more specified .
12794	yeah .
12795	No much s
12796	No no no , not at all .
12797	You just coloured it .
12798	s
12799	Final design .
12800	Basically in what we discussed , cover and buttons will be made of rubber , yellow colour , black components , as you can see right over here .
12801	We chose a different type of colour for the menu .
12802	I like the menu .
12803	A bit darker yellow so that it com really shows in this keypad .
12804	If you put them all black , it is not really that good a contrast .
12805	So
12806	Probab
12807	Yeah .
12808	And I suppose the the the yellow is not printed on the on the rubber .
12809	It is it is part of the rubber , I suppose .
12810	I think that is more I think that is more durable anyway than printed on to
12811	Oh yeah .
12812	That is the be
12813	And it I guess it is more easier to just paint it on the rubber
12814	than to
12815	So we have it is a bit round shaped , that is what we had We chose the buttons to be teletext , okay button , favourite channel and the mute .
12816	Yeah , of course .
12817	That is the integration story again .
12818	Okay .
12819	So that is basically what we chose there .
12820	Okay .
12821	If you have anything to add , please interrupt me .
12822	No ,
12823	this is just a description of what we see there .
12824	So
12825	Speaks for itself .
12826	Yeah .
12827	Yeah .
12828	Oh .
12829	That is pretty much it .
12830	Okay .
12831	Now it is my time to ruin everything .
12832	Well ,
12833	not ruin everything ,
12834	but
12835	no , nah .
12836	Oh sorry .
12837	Finances , that is what we have here , what you drew .
12838	We have battery power , we have advanced chips and the sam the sensor .
12839	The sample sensor and for speak recognition anyway .
12840	So which you see the
12841	which is de o one of the most expensive parts .
12842	So well ,
12843	we have sin one curve , a design .
12844	Rubber design .
12845	And we had a special colour .
12846	Suppose yellow is a special colour .
12847	So just half a Euro for You have pushbuttons and an LCD display .
12848	You have the total of seventeen Euros in production cost , which is higher than the twelve and a half that we are permitted to use .
12849	So ,
12850	easy .
12851	What do we scrap .
12852	Well
12853	think I had the best solution that I came up with is just to s take out the speech recognition .
12854	I d
12855	Yeah .
12856	I would say that too .
12857	Because the LCD has more support on customer side .
12858	There are ninety one percent of the people , or something like that .
12859	But ninety percent who favour an LCD display , and only sixty percent that favour speech recognition .
12860	I think it is also harder to .
12861	we do not really have a extra function with the speech sample , which you ca not do with a normal remote control , which people already do .
12862	Yeah .
12863	So
12864	Well ,
12865	I would I tend to disagree with you on that ,
12866	because the trend issue was a big issue when we started designing this .
12867	So I ju
12868	I took that out .
12869	So
12870	and so it is still stuck with thirteen , so
12871	I had to take out the special colour I suppose .
12872	And , yeah
12873	, I did not see anything else I could take out .
12874	Yeah ,
12875	I could take out the push buttons , but we need those .
12876	Pushbut
12877	Special colour , yeah .
12878	Huh .
12879	So , generally what I came up with , in order to be cou to to have production cost of twelve and a half Euros , spe scrap speech recognition and the separate covers can account for the if people want it ,
12880	we will just then we will do it in black .
12881	We will just deliver it in black ,
12882	have the
12883	it has all the function that it is supposed to have ,
12884	and if you want it if you want the custom design , then you can buy the separate covers .
12885	You make it d orange or whatever you want .
12886	It was a big issue , but
12887	I will just go back .
12888	So ca not we just basically extend it to thirteen ?
12889	Okay .
12890	let is just let is see what
12891	okay ,
12892	let is just see what we
12893	no , we we have to be under twelve and a half .
12894	Yeah ,
12895	it
12896	The p And the p What .
12897	It it is not
12898	the project is a no go if we go over twelve and a half ,
12899	so .
12900	Okay ,
12901	but there is another problem .
12902	But there is another problem .
12903	If we take another cover , for instance black , then we also need another button frame , cause black and black does not work obviously .
12904	I think you
12905	that is what you were ass assigned to do really , to to see how b th both those work together .
12906	Huh .
12907	Huh .
12908	Yeah .
12909	So I think
12910	yeah ,
12911	it is I think it is y one of the
12912	it is a good way to to help people to make to keep the product trendy too .
12913	Just keep you just make new covers for the for it , like we agreed before .
12914	Right .
12915	I agree .
12916	And everything that is left is is the basic function that that we want our product to have .
12917	Because the expensive parts are in either the advanced chip .
12918	But we need that for the LCD display .
12919	Yeah .
12920	We do .
12921	Then again , we have the LCD display , which is also expensive .
12922	B
12923	yeah ,
12924	but those go together .
12925	And yeah ,
12926	we could take out the curve .
12927	Or say let is lose rubber , take plastic .
12928	We could take out a curve indeed .
12929	Could
12930	we could take out the curve .
12931	Is that an option ?
12932	For you ?
12933	Yeah .
12934	Yes .
12935	Although we are demolishing a little bit the style .
12936	But the and
12937	Yeah .
12938	I think the colour is more important than the really the curve ,
12939	because if you just end up with an entirely black remote control
12940	So black and grey is okay .
12941	But
12942	Yeah .
12943	I think it is it it does ruin it ,
12944	but the fact that I t took that decision or t
12945	Took this example actually , not really decision , but the example is because we do offer the the possibility of adding your own custom covers .
12946	The people
12947	Spongy , yeah .
12948	So you can change any colour you want .
12949	So
12950	it is just you deliver a basic remote control with a possibility to change you into whatever you want .
12951	Can we then not also change the material ?
12952	We take plastic for the basic cover
12953	and
12954	We can put those to the to the other covers .
12955	You can take plastic ,
12956	but I d
12957	it is
12958	something that is stuck into my mind is that something that really came forward from the marketing research is that people like the the the the squishy feeling of the spongy feeling of the and it really makes it also makes it different from the existing remote controls , because they are all plastic .
12959	Yeah .
12960	And But
12961	But
12962	The people want to pay for for it ,
12963	so why why do we have to keep us on the twelve and a half ?
12964	Yeah .
12965	That is true .
12966	So which in in turn
12967	Rubber would increase durability because it does not break .
12968	But
12969	okay .
12970	But what do you then suggest we would lose ?
12971	Because we have to lose two things
12972	and I guess .
12973	I al
12974	like I said , I lost the speech recognition and I lost the special colour ,
12975	which would make this black a black and grey .
12976	Yes .
12977	Okay ,
12978	and that is enough ?
12979	Yeah , that is that that that is enough ,
12980	because
12981	I guess those are the basic colours .
12982	So Oh .
12983	Which we can fabricate ,
12984	okay .
12985	I think those are basic col They want to
12986	To ensure the profit .
12987	That that is th that is the order .
12988	We are just we are the project team and we got our our orders from the pro from the boss of our company which say we do not want to spend more than twelve fifty for this .
12989	But we can take a risk .
12990	But that is not for our
12991	that is not our decision to take .
12992	No ,
12993	we basically
12994	We need to stick to that .
12995	We have a budget of twelve fifty per product .
12996	Okay , yeah .
12997	So
12998	Stick that .
12999	I do not think it is really bad either .
13000	I mean if we we have the the backup of or the backup design thing
13001	to have
13002	I think they would do .
13003	I hope the people will like it ,
13004	but
13005	Yeah .
13006	Th I think they do like
13007	because yo we you
13008	we agree upon that the that the the the cover thing was a nice idea , because p you could have all sort of designs while at the same time just manufacturing one product , one basic product which you could turn into any any taste you want .
13009	So
13010	I think it is the best solution to make those cu custom covers for the design aspect and keep the functionality between of within the th the boundaries of the your f your budget .
13011	Perhaps we should make m
13012	Huh .
13013	Yeah .
13014	The first sheet .
13015	So
13016	Well
13017	I do not think
13018	Yeah .
13019	Perhaps we should make clear to our customer that we had to do this to stay under the cost .
13020	And that is they know that this is an option and that we had to drop the option to stay under the cost
13021	, that they know that .
13022	Perhaps they decide tha
13023	Of course .
13024	Is it worth is it is it
13025	does it mean anything to the customer ?
13026	Like , it like , we do not care we do not care that you had to
13027	True ,
13028	but we did we did not get that .
13029	But they do not
13030	Well
13031	And if we
13032	So which curve is that
13033	ba
13034	that is basically that curve .
13035	Perhaps they
13036	no ,
13037	but perhaps they think okay , the cover is such a nice idea , let is that
13038	that
13039	then they that allow us to make some more costs .
13040	We ca we we can at least tell them that
13041	You do not know that .
13042	So I think it is
13043	it should either be a pack , maybe we sh that should be sold in in the s in stores with with a standard cover or something .
13044	Huh .
13045	No , I am not talking about that cost
13046	but the one that g has given us the order to design this .
13047	But They could , but It is an option , but
13048	yeah , it is true .
13049	We could at least m make it like this , like you said , and then tell them okay , we had to drop this and that , just that you know .
13050	It is an still an option , but not for this price .
13051	So actually it is not that much of an increase ,
13052	but yeah .
13053	We cannot contact them .
13054	It is just the order that we got .
13055	Exactly ,
13056	but
13057	Yeah .
13058	So that is what we gotta go with .
13059	So it is either one fi just just to get it f
13060	just to get it through final ,
13061	it is either turned into plastic , drop the squishy feel , make it make it more breakable , or turn it yellow .
13062	Yeah .
13063	So
13064	It is something we have to decide on .
13065	I would say lose the curve and the colour
13066	and
13067	I say lose the curve .
13068	Oh that is true ,
13069	we could lose the c
13070	yeah ,
13071	I forgot that ,
13072	sorry .
13073	the curve .
13074	So
13075	That is just this one just d this is the banana curve .
13076	Yeah , that is better .
13077	So this would this would be straight .
13078	So we could u still have the comfort .
13079	No , no ,
13080	that would be a curve inside the thing , I guess .
13081	No ,
13082	would ju then it would just be a straight remote .
13083	Just like like that .
13084	Which would , yeah , turn it into something far more ordinary .
13085	we could make it yellow then ,
13086	but
13087	You second that , you second that we lose the curve .
13088	I second that .
13089	No ,
13090	that it would turn out to be a pretty straight forward remote control .
13091	Okay , yeah .
13092	So that is not really that I would
13093	Yeah .
13094	Yeah .
13095	Yeah .
13096	So I think it would be a good idea to keep the curve
13097	to separate it from the rest of the remote control world , so to speak .
13098	So we keep the curve .
13099	So the only only solution is either to use the l y lose the yellow or lose the rubber .
13100	And I am in favour of keeping the rubber ,
13101	because it has more more advantages than the colour yellow has .
13102	Oh .
13103	I agree .
13104	I would say I would agree with you on the colour ,
13105	because that is an extra option , an extra service we can deliver for a little bit of more money .
13106	No .
13107	Yep .
13108	So we can always do that .
13109	Yeah ,
13110	I guess people are willing to pay for that .
13111	So I think we can take that option and just with with the idea in the back of our head that you can customise your remote control .
13112	Yeah .
13113	Yes .
13114	So I think that would still make it a nice product .
13115	Okay ,
13116	we are final on that .
13117	So
13118	it is too bad we ca not make the whole super thing .
13119	But anyways we are here .
13120	yeah .
13121	Which is basically what we discussed .
13122	This we discussed just now .
13123	That is just now just
13124	we could just discuss how the project went .
13125	I mean , was kind of
13126	I sort of expected that everything would turn out this way ,
13127	but because you
13128	yeah ,
13129	everything cannot be for free .
13130	And I want to do that .
13131	We did not
13132	I think it was too bad we did not have the financial info the last time .
13133	Because that was I th
13134	it was really essential really
13135	to ma
13136	because we spent entire stage designing a product of which we had no idea what it would cost .
13137	Yes ,
13138	we could have
13139	Well
13140	I hope it sells .
13141	Huh .
13142	So we just put something
13143	I think it is really nor not in stroke with reality actually .
13144	Yeah .
13145	So
13146	Yeah .
13147	Me too , I felt a bit blind throughout the project , because in the beginning I had no list of available materials , and then I d had not list of available c finances .
13148	Yeah ,
13149	I think would have been .
13150	Yeah .
13151	But
13152	Let is see
13153	Let is
13154	Oh .
13155	Materials would be ok at least the last meeting I would have expected had to have that .
13156	So
13157	So I suppose
13158	Yeah ,
13159	let is see if it sells .
13160	I mean I suppose this sells , because it is very very extended .
13161	But
13162	I suppose it sells ,
13163	because it is good .
13164	I mean it is got everything for the for the reasonable price , because we did not know what it is going to cost anyway .
13165	Okay ,
13166	let is eval evaluate the product of us , our design .
13167	I have some a method , a requirements and scale of .
13168	I will pre present some statements and we will decided together wha what if it is true or false and then we see if the requirements of the user are fulfilled or not .
13169	Okay .
13170	Have been met , okay .
13171	And I will make a new blank sheet
13172	Yeah .
13173	So so the buttons , the look and feel .
13174	I thought it was okay , but the advanced settings , screen , audio and channel
13175	We are not
13176	Oh
13177	the menu button is it .
13178	Which are basically accessible through the menu button .
13179	They are stuck under menu .
13180	For the menu .
13181	I think those are totally met , because we we really took them for the they have the feel they want
13182	, they have the simplicity they want .
13183	Yeah .
13184	Hi
13185	Oh , okay .
13186	Then it is all S
13187	it is true .
13188	I think it is very very well met .
13189	Either two or one maybe .
13190	One .
13191	I think we took that everything they wanted into consideration .
13192	Yeah .
13193	So it could either be a two or a one .
13194	So d
13195	Oh wait .
13196	One and a half .
13197	pen .
13198	Which is not an option .
13199	The p
13200	Oh yeah ,
13201	it is red ,
13202	okay ,
13203	but
13204	Look and feel is everybo it is true .
13205	Just create our own option .
13206	Yeah .
13207	So
13208	Anyone ?
13209	And the next one yeah , when it is lost you can find it .
13210	It is perfect .
13211	Even for deaf people , yeah .
13212	It is
13213	Yeah .
13214	It is
13215	I do not think it is perfect , but we did everything possible to to get it back .
13216	To make it that way , yeah .
13217	Because if it is stuck in you couch , you can see the light .
13218	Maybe you can hear it .
13219	But I mean we tried ,
13220	so I think it that is that deserves a one .
13221	And it is and it is
13222	yeah .
13223	Definitely .
13224	To .
13225	That is okay then .
13226	And the next one .
13227	How is that ?
13228	w we had we do not have an manual ,
13229	yeah .
13230	Manual .
13231	But I think that is a part of it .
13232	I think the LCD display could be a little bit more difficult then a normal remote control , but then again , it is for young people .
13233	But
13234	Yeah ,
13235	an LCD , it tells a lot about
13236	Yeah .
13237	I would use an remote control .
13238	yeah .
13239	So
13240	Yeah ,
13241	I th
13242	Exactly .
13243	And it is pretty straight forward , you have a navigation no keys to navigate through the LCD menus .
13244	It is pretty straight forward , uh huh .
13245	No , that is true .
13246	I think it wo not be a big problem .
13247	So
13248	One I d no ,
13249	actu
13250	No ,
13251	it it is pretty straight forward .
13252	So it is a one
13253	or a
13254	I do not know .
13255	I think but we did not even
13256	there was no issue on making a manual actually .
13257	For the advanced settings .
13258	We did not really discuss it ,
13259	but I do not think it takes
13260	no , it really does does not take time to learn , I think .
13261	No okay , that that is true .
13262	We took it s
13263	it is so easy , we have so little button , everything speaks for itself really .
13264	Oh ,
13265	so it Takes no ti
13266	Yeah .
13267	So I think that is
13268	yeah ,
13269	we did not
13270	it is either two or one , I guess .
13271	With the more important functions on .
13272	Maybe it is a two ,
13273	because d the LCD is a little is a little new and there is there are some option hidden under the menu button .
13274	So I might make this a two instead of a one , I guess .
13275	Yeah .
13276	Yeah .
13277	And the LCD , you have to see it .
13278	So just make that a two .
13279	Oh ,
13280	it is a little bit learning .
13281	Okay .
13282	yeah
13283	it is a little bit same .
13284	But it tells you or not ?
13285	But wha w
13286	oh , yeah .
13287	You can use the LCD in a good way .
13288	I think so .
13289	I think it is perfect , the w where it is , what it can do , if it useful .
13290	I think so .
13291	What are we displaying on the LCD screen ?
13292	Just only the channels and or
13293	What ?
13294	Oh , in the LCD screen .
13295	the menus Things like brightness and those kind of things we have put in the menu , because we have no buttons for those .
13296	Well ,
13297	basically the menu options indeed .
13298	But
13299	No .
13300	No ,
13301	y
13302	I mean in the LCD screen , the small screen .
13303	Yes .
13304	What does it display ?
13305	Well
13306	I thought it was
13307	I thought it was
13308	I thought that people wanted previews on their I am not sure if that even possible ,
13309	but
13310	cause it is this requires a quite quite a bit of band width .
13311	And for a channel selection , or that is not
13312	Yeah , I thought I thought too
13313	but
13314	yeah .
13315	I do not think it is possible really .
13316	But the
13317	they did not really define in what should be used for .
13318	Maybe a TV guide or something in your LCD
13319	Yeah .
13320	But I think in for example like TV guides , I think that is that th that you can transmit through it and everything .
13321	Just for extra information on your programmes .
13322	Yeah ,
13323	it must be clear then what what what for we use it .
13324	But also things like like like menus or p how about preferences of your
13325	with configuring your remote control for favourite your favourite channel for example , how do you configure that .
13326	Yeah .
13327	Yeah .
13328	So that could be done by LCD display .
13329	I think it is good .
13330	No , maybe it is not a one because it is we are not using it perfectly .
13331	We did not give it I do not thing over discussing .
13332	Now we gave it enough thought though .
13333	Yeah .
13334	I think we d should just lower this .
13335	Maybe maybe it is a three though .
13336	We could have used it more effectively probably .
13337	Yeah , indeed .
13338	So
13339	everybody is agree with an three on it ,
13340	it is W
13341	Yeah .
13342	Yes .
13343	Yeah .
13344	Yeah ,
13345	we are using it ,
13346	but it is not
13347	it is not poorly used , but it is not efficiently used , I think .
13348	Two or three .
13349	So You can seven .
13350	We could have ev even lost the selection button and done everything via LCD selection .
13351	Yeah .
13352	It is
13353	now it is just extra to illustrate im extra features ,
13354	but okay .
13355	Yeah ,
13356	I
13357	A three .
13358	Nah , it is not really only an extra .
13359	, nothing , that is A seven .
13360	No menus .
13361	Think about
13362	that is
13363	Yeah .
13364	Can you talk to remote control ?
13365	Well ,
13366	it ca not talk anymore .
13367	Or we could say it
13368	Or we could say neutral ,
13369	we cause we scratched the C
13370	No , we do not have the colour .
13371	So we scrap that .
13372	Oh yeah
13373	Just to be a prick ,
13374	but of course you can talk to your remote control , it does not do anything .
13375	Yeah
13376	yeah
13377	yeah
13378	yeah .
13379	But you c you can talk to it .
13380	Not with the speech recognition .
13381	yeah ,
13382	all the trends and no colours anymore .
13383	So
13384	Yeah ,
13385	only in the curves .
13386	Well ,
13387	we did take everything into consideration of course .
13388	the shape i shape is i
13389	I think
13390	we
13391	yeah ,
13392	I think that is okay .
13393	But the colours , we do not have special colours on it .
13394	Yeah ,
13395	special co
13396	but we took into consideration the fact that it is customisable
13397	to the fashi
13398	We do not have it
13399	we do have it ,
13400	it is just sold as a package .
13401	So I
13402	Yes ,
13403	but the end product
13404	So
13405	Maybe we should go with a two then , because it is not perfect ,
13406	because we ca not do it initially ,
13407	but we
13408	Yeah .
13409	Yeah ,
13410	but we
13411	yeah ,
13412	we do not have it ,
13413	so d In the end product .
13414	But M
13415	Changing covers is also trend that we followed .
13416	It does
13417	it is not part of the basic product .
13418	It that
13419	that is what I call trendy .
13420	I mean the shape is trendy .
13421	The the sh the the functions are trendy .
13422	It is just the colours that are not supporting the basic model .
13423	Now
13424	But it is not a one .
13425	Because you ha
13426	it is just not affordable at the moment .
13427	Yeah .
13428	Oh .
13429	It is possible , but you have to pay extra for the for the possibility of having it in a f a different colour .
13430	Oh well Oops .
13431	Oh it is a two ,
13432	right ?
13433	On the last one .
13434	that n that is all .
13435	Overall score .
13436	Overall score .
13437	Overall .
13438	It is
13439	ten , sixteen three two
13440	two point seven or something like that .
13441	One two three .
13442	sixteen .
13443	Two two point some two point something .
13444	I do not know why .
13445	Ten , sixteen , divided by Is two two third .
13446	Six .
13447	Six .
13448	Two and two thirds .
13449	So
13450	we can say it is it is the product is it is okay .
13451	It is okay ,
13452	but that is yo m
13453	mostly it is it is influenced by the fact that we did not have enough resources to implement speech recognition .
13454	Y not
13455	Yeah .
13456	There is
13457	Yeah ,
13458	if we make it into a four , as in neutral , because we did not implement it , so we ca not say that we that it is really not well implemented .
13459	Cause
13460	yeah ,
13461	that gives you a seven , which ruins your your average .
13462	Without that it would be like under it would not
13463	yeah , it would be under two .
13464	So I think we have even with this it is reasonable .
13465	Woah .
13466	Yeah .
13467	We come out on a average of two one eighth .
13468	Well
13469	I think it is
13470	two is okay .
13471	So
13472	which is pretty w good .
13473	Yeah , two is pretty good .
13474	It is at least on the positive side .
13475	So
13476	We could definitely have done better if we have had more resources ,
13477	but
13478	Yeah .
13479	, of course .
13480	Definitely .
13481	Yeah .
13482	Yeah ,
13483	I think it is probably I
13484	I do admit that we d did miss a little or did not sp did not talk talk enough about the possibility of the LCD display .
13485	Yeah .
13486	We could have used it more efficiently , we just did not think of it that way .
13487	Yeah .
13488	Yeah ,
13489	with .
13490	True .
13491	So
13492	like I said , changing channels , everything hidden in your LCD display , so you just need the navigation buttons to do everything .
13493	The scale .
13494	But I think for this price , this is it is really a reasonable product .
13495	I think we div
13496	I think we did very well , ev
13497	even if you look at this score , we did quite well .
13498	It is a good product .
13499	Yeah .
13500	With an LCD screen .
13501	Oh .
13502	It just looking for improvements what what you could have improved .
13503	Oh .
13504	Yeah .
13505	So .
13506	But if pep people really want speech recognition , then they must be prepared to pu to pay more , because it is cannot be done for this .
13507	Yeah ,
13508	you can make them another one .
13509	They sh they should get kids , and just stick them in TV and say change the channel .
13510	yeah .
13511	but for this price you cannot ask that .
13512	I do not think so .
13513	You cannot th think of that
13514	No , it is not .
13515	it is just not it it is not affordable .
13516	Or your sh you should lose the LCD screen probably ,
13517	but I think that is I think the LCD screen is more worth than speech recognition .
13518	Oh It is also more attractive .
13519	Definitely .
13520	Okay ,
13521	that was that .
13522	Yeah .
13523	Yeah .
13524	So that is the final product without the speakers , I guess .
13525	So did you
13526	Yeah .
13527	Let is see ,
13528	what was left in the the Another one .
13529	Yeah ,
13530	we evaluate the product .
13531	General project , what is i in
13532	For example , I thou I thought we were pretty creative in what we created .
13533	We took the whole new approach of making exchangeable cover for example , which I thought was pretty creative , because it was never never ever listed somewhere .
13534	Favourite channel .
13535	Well Anyways .
13536	Yeah ,
13537	leadership is up to you .
13538	I mean perhaps I screwed up
13539	because I d put a put a speech recognition into it .
13540	But that is not for me to decide .
13541	Yeah , I know .
13542	I think we did pretty well as team work though .
13543	Yeah .
13544	Because , yeah was very hard to work with one another if you cannot communicate in the meantime , because when I got the when I got the input for the financial results , initially of course I wanted to contact you .
13545	Yes .
13546	Yeah , you are working separate .
13547	Yeah .
13548	Say , look , this is you are doing the wrong thing , you are s
13549	you are wasting your time now , because we are implementing stuff that we cannot afford .
13550	Yeah .
13551	Huh .
13552	Yeah ,
13553	yeah
13554	yeah .
13555	So it would be better if y if there was more communication between
13556	because that is that is what would w you what you would normally do , either call or email someone .
13557	Yeah
13558	yeah
13559	yeah .
13560	Direct communication with
13561	yeah .
13562	And we could share information which we received .
13563	So that was too bad
13564	con
13565	was impossible here anyways .
13566	That is the same thing that I had in the beginning .
13567	Everybody was using materials that s I did not have .
13568	So
13569	Oh .
13570	It did not have or did not knew what they costs or whatever .
13571	Yeah .
13572	There was just too little information about what things actually cost and if you could use them .
13573	Yeah .
13574	So that was a little unclear I suppose .
13575	I think a SMARTboard SMARTboard is pretty cool .
13576	I think s especially for design issues , it is very easy just to give your give your thoughts a little it is easier to share them .
13577	My handwriting is little bit
13578	yeah .
13579	Yeah .
13580	Although for actual design I would say the response time should be a little bit higher ,
13581	because
13582	The digital pen was definitely better to draw my ideas and to further elaborate on that .
13583	It is a little less it
13584	the response time is le it is very bad .
13585	It is good to visualise everything ,
13586	but I think the response time should could be a lot better .
13587	But th that is
13588	Yeah , okay .
13589	Definitely .
13590	Yeah , it is true .
13591	So
13592	Oh can you ?
13593	Okay .
13594	But there is also one problem with this I noticed .
13595	you have to finish a page before going to a
13596	n
13597	Oh .
13598	No , you do not have to .
13599	No .
13600	No , you do not .
13601	I jin
13602	I did not check the finish button .
13603	You can
13604	Done and then it is okay .
13605	I just
13606	you just ditch it and you can copy it or whatever .
13607	Okay ,
13608	I saw that
13609	only if you check the notes or press done .
13610	Then it then you can then it exports to Word automatically .
13611	But it is not necessary to check either one of those two .
13612	You can just preview your p you can just preview your page in the in the programme .
13613	Yeah ,
13614	but I made
13615	Okay ,
13616	but I made three pages and they were not finished .
13617	Oh , okay .
13618	Okay , yeah .
13619	And when the third one was finished , I wanted to download it
13620	and then it was not possible anymore , because you have to close all the pinnits the pages before going further .
13621	Okay ,
13622	before starting a ne a new page .
13623	Okay .
13624	Okay , that could be b .
13625	Exactly .
13626	So we cannot work on more than one page at same time .
13627	Oh .
13628	That is not possible .
13629	You have to finish it completely , then download it ,
13630	it is
13631	then start a new one .
13632	Okay .
13633	Yeah , okay .
13634	That is not very handy ,
13635	but if you know that , then it is not a problem .
13636	That is
13637	Yeah ,
13638	it is understandable , okay .
13639	Any new ideas ?
13640	Yeah ,
13641	more communication between between
13642	that is the thing I noticed , that communication is very very important , because if you get new information , it is essential f for the other team mates to know that as soon as possible , because you would avoid making doing extra work , because you were doing extra work now m working on the on the speech recognition , you have limitation both on the technical on the d on the design side .
13643	Important to
13644	Yeah .
13645	So I think that could have been better .
13646	But that is I think it is more of a a setting here that you cannot communicate than than somewhere else .
13647	So
13648	Yeah , I think so .
13649	Yeah , well
13650	it could also possibly be well , is it a more real time information base ,
13651	so we can all see which information is available to one another .
13652	And l less p less spam probably .
13653	I am not sure i I am not sure you got spammed as well ,
13654	but I get spammed like every t every two minutes
13655	there was
13656	a there was another email about master classes or something .
13657	Well .
13658	So
13659	which were totally useless actually .
13660	I thought I should probably look into them ,
13661	but they were all useless .
13662	So I just
13663	Oh okay .
13664	Well ,
13665	I personally did not have that ,
13666	but
13667	That is probably your l description .
13668	Yeah ,
13669	after After five minutes ,
13670	Yeah .
13671	But I also did not not really .
13672	But still ,
13673	you had that as well .
13674	Huh .
13675	Is that we finished up the design
13676	and then we checked the website , and then there was just extra information .
13677	Yeah .
13678	Yeah ,
13679	There was a little delay in the bit of a c crucial delay .
13680	I did not have any more information , it is just always the same here .
13681	So that is that is kind of a
13682	It would change , but not for me .
13683	Email it is
13684	Yeah .
13685	So I would I had no extra information to go on that one than what you give me actually .
13686	I could not do any research myself
13687	or I see , that is
13688	yeah ,
13689	w
13690	I could have done a little extra work probably ,
13691	then
13692	But I was busy enough anyway .
13693	So
13694	Any new ideas found ?
13695	Or is that a cause
13696	yeah , it is well ,
13697	probably is .
13698	No .
13699	How much time do we have for this anyway ?
13700	Yeah .
13701	I have no clue .
13702	That is like oh,but it Should i
13703	if the project is evaluated and it was it was in b within budget , we should celebrate .
13704	So
13705	okay ,
13706	think that is about it .
13707	Okay ,
13708	bring out the beer .
13709	Champagne .
13710	I want one for my own .
13711	I am not sure what we should still do though
13712	t let is see
13713	what
13714	all your tasks were finished ,
13715	right ?
13716	What you ha from your assistant .
13717	Yeah .
13718	I have no more email .
13719	So let is
13720	Okay ,
13721	I should I think I sh
13722	I still have the the total report to finish up .
13723	My coach is being very silent now .
13724	Yeah ,
13725	my personal coach i
13726	What
13727	Yeah , name .
13728	I think we took very little time now ,
13729	because
13730	Yeah ,
13731	we are in agreement ,
13732	everything
13733	the design is okay .
13734	The one thing we missed though , we do not have a product name .
13735	No ,
13736	we have not think above about that .
13737	How about you cook a how about you cook up a product name ?
13738	Just
13739	oh , think of a catchy name .
13740	Product name .
13741	Huh .
13742	It is better than thi I think than a serial number .
13743	Sony TR something f means nothing to me .
13744	Or fruit name .
13745	Like fruit names .
13746	I will be working on this until the beep until it beeps .
13747	So
13748	What ?
13749	Fruit ?
13750	You do not want it to resemble a banana .
13751	Fruit name or something like that .
13752	The banana remote or something .
13753	I do not know .
13754	Yeah , it is the form of it .
13755	The bana
13756	cause it is not yellow anymore .
13757	It is not yellow anyway .
13758	Yeah
13759	oh ,
13760	yeah .
13761	It is not yellow anymore .
13762	It is curved ,
13763	but
13764	No ,
13765	it is
13766	yeah .
13767	Well ,
13768	I was going for the RC deluxe ,
13769	but it is not really a catchy name or anything ,
13770	it is more
13771	Something with our company name ,
13772	can we do anything with that ?
13773	Maybe there is something on the website which will help us out .
13774	Yeah .
13775	at least it is not something with numbers .
13776	Numbers are so meaningless to the people .
13777	I mean .
13778	That is true .
13779	Reaction , Real Reaction .
13780	Real Reaction .
13781	The reaction deluxe .
13782	Real Reaction future RC .
13783	Step into the future of of remote controlling your TV .
13784	Is that a name or a c campaign ?
13785	Yeah .
13786	No that is a that is a catchy slogan .
13787	Or the
13788	The real reactor .
13789	Control your remote control .
13790	Real react .
13791	I go for future RC probably .
13792	Something like It is short f
13793	Real reactor ?
13794	that that is
13795	That makes me think of different products than a remote control really .
13796	The Real Reactor , I do not find that that bad at all .
13797	Yeah .
13798	You should write it down as a an option .
13799	Because our name is Real Reaction .
13800	I am not sure .
13801	Real reaction in a real
13802	Real reactor .
13803	Zapping .
13804	The
13805	Yeah , sure .
13806	So that is one option .
13807	Did not notice .
13808	I am looking for things in the name .
13809	So that the first three letters are s the same .
13810	Should I write the banana down or Sure ?
13811	Well
13812	I do you mean it like
13813	You mean it like this ?
13814	Dash C ?
13815	Like a C right now or a dash in a C ?
13816	Is it triple RCs ?
13817	No .
13818	REA REA .
13819	I take f
13820	yeah ,
13821	take a banana .
13822	The banana .
13823	Remote .
13824	Banana recei RC .
13825	The triple R .
13826	Real Reaction remotes control .
13827	Remote .
13828	Triple R .
13829	R three C .
13830	yeah .
13831	R three C .
13832	Yeah ,
13833	that .
13834	Real Reaction Remote Control .
13835	R three C .
13836	Oh yeah .
13837	No , not like that .
13838	It should be it should be longer ,
13839	because it is not a product name that you f print on a box .
13840	I think triple R .
13841	Does not sound ?
13842	Yeah .
13843	Just write out triple , like a word triple RC , triple stripe
13844	Oh .
13845	Yeah , triple R .
13846	Triple dash R dash s s C .
13847	Triple RC .
13848	The triple RC , yeah .
13849	Yeah .
13850	R s R three C .
13851	R dash C .
13852	I think I like it like this more .
13853	Dash .
13854	Triple R or triple RC ?
13855	How about do both ?
13856	Sure if it looks stupid .
13857	Triple R dash .
13858	I think that the the RC together takes away the the the image of it is a triple
13859	the first the first one looks like it is a triple remote control , but it is only a single remote control .
13860	That
13861	Yeah ,
13862	this
13863	yeah .
13864	And it is especially on the triple R that is important .
13865	I would huh .
13866	The Real Reaction Remote .
13867	I would lose the C and just name it triple R .
13868	It sounds like thinking about two different things and combining it .
13869	Triple remote .
13870	I would just say triple Rs triple R
13871	That is also short , catchy .
13872	Yeah .
13873	Yeah , triple R
13874	yeah ,
13875	you can
13876	Yeah , triple R .
13877	Well ,
13878	that is another option .
13879	It is okay .
13880	Okay , so
13881	which ones are we going to scratch definitely ?
13882	I say this one as well .
13883	The banana .
13884	Banana .
13885	Banana remote .
13886	Banana .
13887	Yeah ,
13888	the deluxe .
13889	I think we are all in agreement about the triple R .
13890	I think triple R is cool .
13891	Yes .
13892	The r triple R .
13893	Triple R ?
13894	Triple R it is .
13895	And it looks cool when you print it in font , looks pretty cool .
13896	Yeah .
13897	did you do now ?
13898	Yeah .
13899	Just like this just
13900	and you just print triple R ,
13901	it looks
13902	does not look bad ,
13903	it is short ,
13904	it is okay .
13905	Yeah .
13906	So
13907	have to write my report now , I guess .
13908	Yeah , so
13909	we have everything .
13910	We have the product , we have the costs , we have the possibility of everything .
13911	Yep .
13912	It ca not work .
13913	That will not
13914	Okay .
13915	Okay .
13916	I think it is adjourned .
13917	Retire to my lair and finish the report .

13933	Oh sh
13934	Yeah , okay ,
13935	I will ask you when I need the information .
13936	I do not really know whether we can save it as a picture or no .
13937	Is it okay if I try ?
13938	Is that okay with you ?
13939	I will put it back in a minute .
13940	Sure .
13941	So it is
13942	oh .

13963	That one is .
13964	Document and settings .
13965	I would not pick that one , no .
13966	That is a pity .
13967	That means that we have to going to draw it again .

13969	Okay .
13970	Sure .
