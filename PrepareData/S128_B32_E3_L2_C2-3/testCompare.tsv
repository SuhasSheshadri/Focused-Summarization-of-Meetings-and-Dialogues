1	0	a	Great man .
2	0	a	Who starts ?
3	0	a	Alright , great .
4	1	a	Well I will start just with another presentation ,
5	0	a	so then we can look at th at the agenda for this meeting .
6	0	a	Alright .
7	0	a	Okay .
8	0	a	I have put some new things in the in the map .
9	0	a	oh .
10	0	a	This is it .
11	0	a	I do not know the shortcut , so
12	0	a	F five .
13	0	a	Well our functional design meeting , that is the stage we are in .
14	0	a	And you also ha all three of you have prepared something about it .
15	0	a	Yes .
16	0	a	Well in we will just have a look at the at the notes from the previous meeting , what we thought we had dec decided .
17	0	a	But
18	0	a	then we will look at the three presentations from you .
19	0	a	Kay .
20	0	a	I think you have prepared all three ?
21	0	a	we will look at th the new project requirements
22	0	a	we I dunno .
23	0	a	Well , yeah .
24	0	a	Yeah .
25	0	a	Y you also have received that mail , the new project requirements from our bosses ?
26	0	a	Oh I have received a mail with some additional requirements ,
27	0	a	and I will have a look if
28	1	a	Well I think we should show them before your presentations ,
29	0	a	because it is not really smart to to include some things we ca not , because of the new requirements .
30	0	a	No .
31	0	a	No .
32	0	a	You are the only one .
33	0	a	Oh .
34	0	a	Alright .
35	0	a	Kay .
36	0	a	Well then we can make some decisions about our remote control functions .
37	0	a	We have to deb we have to decide it in this meeting what our function will be .
38	1	a	And then we can discuss some more closely .
39	0	a	We have forty minutes for this discussion ?
40	0	a	Alright .
41	0	a	yeah , I think so .
42	0	a	Well the closing we will not look at it yet .
43	0	a	Alright .
44	1	a	now I will look at show this board .
45	0	a	Well notes , first meeting .
46	0	a	Now .
47	0	a	I gave a disc a a presentation .
48	0	a	we familiarised ourself with the boards and then we discussed some first ideas .
49	0	a	So we said that we have to merge the strong points from our competitors , and look at their remote controls .
50	0	a	Right .
51	0	a	We should make it compatible with our new DVD and other releases we have , our technical releases .
52	0	a	Huh ?
53	0	a	Yeah .
54	0	a	not too many one buttons .
55	0	a	One recognisable button in the middle , where you do the most important functions with .
56	0	a	And well they can have two functions , because you have a DVD and a television .
57	0	a	the design has to fit the hand , be original , but also be familiar .
58	0	a	It is one of our ideas .
59	0	a	Yeah well that
60	0	a	wa
61	0	a	It is just thirty minutes ago ,
62	0	a	so it is not quite
63	0	a	But well I have to do it .
64	0	a	, now it is right .
65	0	a	Yeah .
66	0	a	The materials well should be hard plastic with rubber from , and well the labelling of the buttons should be indestructible .
67	0	a	It should be recognisable at all times .
68	0	a	It is meant to be easily wiped out , yeah .
69	0	a	Yes .
70	0	a	Okay .
71	0	a	Well fronts were to be just like mobile telephones .
72	0	a	And the technical aspects And also labelling of the buttons , the functions should be universal standards .
73	0	a	Well that is just some ideas from the first meeting .
74	0	a	It is quite logical al all of it .
75	1	a	now the new project requirements , I will just show them .
76	0	a	I got this mail from our bosses .
77	0	a	Well , teletext goes out .
78	0	a	Oh .
79	0	a	We will not use teletext .
80	0	a	Okay .
81	1	a	Maybe a new sort of thing , but n but not teletext .
82	0	a	I I disagree , but it is not t it is not my place to disagree
83	0	a	I guess .
84	0	a	Well
85	0	a	the second is a bit sh pity
86	0	a	because we just said we wanted to d include the DVD and they do not want it , because of our time we have for this project .
87	0	a	Oh .
88	0	a	Alright .
89	0	a	Oh , alright .
90	0	a	Oh , that is a shame .
91	0	a	So that is a shame ,
92	0	a	because especially for the third requirement we want to reach people under the thirty years .
93	0	a	Because we do not have those customers a lot at th at this point .
94	0	a	well it is a bit pity
95	0	a	because it is just those people want to have one remote control for all those technical devices they can reach it .
96	0	a	Yeah .
97	1	a	But let is forget about it .
98	0	a	It is just time consuming ,
99	1	a	so we have to go on .
100	0	a	Yeah .
101	0	a	Well and our corporate image should stay rec recognisable in our products .
102	1	a	So we have to use maybe a slogan , maybe a colour , and
103	0	a	Yeah well on our remote controls the design has to be , well as we already said a actually , familiar .
104	0	a	Yes .
105	0	a	not only just the shape but also our company .
106	0	a	Yeah , we are a real fashionable company .
107	0	a	I read I read it on the
108	0	a	I did not know what company we were , but we we design especially trendy trendy trendy stuff .
109	0	a	Yeah .
110	0	a	Yeah .
111	0	a	Yeah .
112	0	a	Yeah .
113	0	a	So it has to be a modern design .
114	0	a	Okay .
115	0	a	That is important to know , when you design a thing of course .
116	0	a	Yes .
117	0	a	I
118	0	a	I noted our slogan that we have , our company .
119	0	a	It is we put the fashion in electronics .
120	0	a	Yeah .
121	0	a	Right .
122	1	a	So maybe that is a slogan we can put somewhere on our remote control or something .
123	0	a	Yeah .
124	0	a	Alright then we are going to have three presentations .
125	0	a	Yeah .
126	1	a	You want to start ?
127	0	a	Oh you have to start ?
128	0	a	I did not see anything about who had to start .
129	0	a	Yeah .
130	1	a	I think I have to start .
131	0	a	Oh no , no problem .
132	0	a	The order ?
133	0	a	No .
134	1	a	Well s then start .
135	0	a	I I just have to to think which file is mine , cause I was bit in a hurry .
136	0	a	Okay .
137	0	a	Well
138	0	a	You already opened PowerPoint .
139	0	a	I think it is this one .
140	0	a	But I am not sure .
141	0	a	Yeah .
142	0	a	S
143	0	a	Right .
144	0	a	Yes .
145	0	a	This is it .
146	0	a	Yeah .
147	1	a	Well , I am going to tell you something about functional requirements .
148	0	a	to start with these points .
149	0	a	next sheet ?
150	1	a	at first I tell you something about what people dislike about the current controls ,
151	0	a	because it is a smart thing to exclude those things .
152	0	a	, furthermore it is very important what they do like and what they do use .
153	1	a	then I tell something about the most important issues .
154	0	a	So we have to focus on those three thing three things .
155	1	a	And in the end I will show you our target audience or our target product users , customers .
156	0	a	Well , the first findings are that people think most controls are very kind of ug ugly .
157	0	a	That is seventy five per cent of the current users .
158	0	a	They do not like it ,
159	1	a	so we might think about fronts in that section .
160	0	a	They also say , that is about I thought it was fifty per cent , that more money will be spent on better looking controls .
161	0	a	So it is very important that you design a a nice looking control .
162	0	a	the current user uses his machine just about well all of the time for a few functions .
163	0	a	, almost every user uses it d the the control for just ten per cent of its capacity .
164	1	a	So it is really important to make the the buttons for the common tasks kind of big or kind of flashy .
165	0	a	Furthermore , it is seventy five per cent of the users zaps a lot .
166	1	a	Thus it might be might be smart to make a a big zapping button or something in the middle , so you can reach it with your thumb .
167	1	a	You can zap away .
168	0	a	Yeah ,
169	0	a	yeah right .
170	0	a	Yeah .
171	1	a	Yeah .
172	0	a	Right .
173	0	a	A lot of losers users lose their controls in their in their living room .
174	1	a	So it might be sensible to make some kind of a button on your television , that is your your control beeps or something , that you can find this very easily .
175	0	a	Yeah .
176	1	a	I dunno , maybe that is an idea .
177	0	a	Well
178	1	a	It should actually It should actually be loose from the television ,
179	0	a	because it can also be used for other televisions .
180	0	a	Cause it is a big I think fifty per cent of the users loses his its control , within the same room .
181	0	a	Oh .
182	0	a	Oh ? .
183	0	a	Yeah .
184	0	a	Yeah
185	0	a	but what if you lose your click on device ?
186	1	a	Yeah
187	1	a	but if someone d somebody else uses it in ano other room or something ?
188	0	a	Nee but it
189	0	a	it specifically says it is the the control is lost in the same room .
190	1	a	So if you deliver a small click on device that you can put on your television , that bleeps to your remote control , everyone can use it .
191	0	a	No
192	1	a	you can click it on your television .
193	0	a	Yeah in another room ,
194	0	a	yeah .
195	0	a	Well yes .
196	0	a	Yeah .
197	0	a	So
198	0	a	Well a beeping device would be
199	0	a	furthermore the learning time is a problem .
200	0	a	Well we will have a look at it , yeah .
201	0	a	thirty four thirty four per cent thinks it is it is too too difficult to learn .
202	1	a	So the the learning curve should be very short for the dumbest people should be able to use it .
203	1	a	I think our user expert should also consider manual a manual for the remote , of course .
204	0	a	Yeah but people do not read manuals .
205	0	a	I did not read it ?
206	0	a	Oh , alright .
207	0	a	No .
208	0	a	No .
209	0	a	users to add one ?
210	0	a	Do you think ?
211	0	a	I do not think
212	0	a	Yeah .
213	1	a	I think you should put more time in the in the design of pick up and use , than a manual .
214	0	a	Yes
215	0	a	you should You should could take a look at it and and and know how it how it is supposed to work .
216	0	a	Yeah alright .
217	0	a	Yep .
218	0	a	Because they do not use it ?
219	0	a	Alright .
220	0	a	Yeah .
221	0	a	Well there sh should always be a menu , but it c can be very short .
222	0	a	Right .
223	0	a	And it should be consistent with consistent with older remotes .
224	0	a	Yeah but nobody reads a manual about a remote control , I think .
225	0	a	Yes okay .
226	0	a	Well maybe for the If you do not recognise a button who d who d who do I call wh when I do not know it ?
227	0	a	Is not it part of the of the u
228	0	a	No .
229	0	a	Alright .
230	0	a	Yeah right .
231	0	a	It sh it should be there , the manual .
232	0	a	But but not to explain how the remote works .
233	0	a	Only
234	0	a	And we do not have much time .
235	1	a	So it is better to put our attention to the the design .
236	1	a	So you can pick up and use it , than I think .
237	0	a	Well we are a design team ,
238	1	a	we can say to some writer make a manual point .
239	0	a	Yeah right , right .
240	0	a	So
241	0	a	Well we will have a look .
242	0	a	No .
243	0	a	Never mind .
244	0	a	Next point .
245	0	a	yes ?
246	0	a	Yep .
247	0	a	RSI .
248	0	a	Well that is about twenty per cent I thought .
249	0	a	But the designer should take it should Wie zeg ik dat ?
250	0	a	Yeah , consider the consequences of using your remote .
251	0	a	Consider the m
252	0	a	Yeah .
253	0	a	It should be a good in your hand .
254	0	a	Right ,
255	0	a	this is the most important part .
256	0	a	, we are
257	0	a	Like the requirements said , we are going to specify of we are going to target a younger audience .
258	0	a	, that is about sixty per cent of the market , so it is quite important .
259	0	a	research shows that they like to have a little LCD screen on their on their zapping device .
260	0	a	I thought it was the age between sixteen and twenty , ninety nine per cent of the people like that .
261	0	a	Well
262	0	a	Well with twelve Euro fifty as production cost , we ca not afford an LCD
263	0	a	Yeah .
264	1	a	So it is very important we should definitely have that in our designs .
265	0	a	It is going to be expensive .
266	0	a	No .
267	0	a	Yeah .
268	0	a	Yeah but they think it is really important .
269	0	a	So if we want to s If we have a big
270	1	a	If we make lots of of the stuff , maybe we can buy it very cheap , I dunno .
271	0	a	We have to
272	0	a	Yeah ,
273	0	a	I do not know .
274	1	a	Well we will consider it .
275	0	a	Well
276	0	a	Yeah well it is your your task to look into the costs of those
277	0	a	Nigh
278	0	a	I know .
279	0	a	We will think abo we will think
280	1	a	No , we will look we will look into that later .
281	0	a	I do not have any information on that .
282	0	a	So
283	0	a	Right .
284	0	a	Alright ?
285	0	a	We have very demanding clients .
286	0	a	And another thing is speech recognition .
287	0	a	They also like that , but research is very costly .
288	0	a	I think that is difficult to realise also .
289	0	a	So
290	1	a	Yeah ,
291	1	a	but it
292	1	a	it might be important for the sale .
293	0	a	It is not yet a standard development those so
294	0	a	We sh
295	0	a	Yeah absolutely .
296	0	a	No
297	0	a	and we have customers in multiple countries I think .
298	0	a	Well I do think LCD is more reachable than the speech recognition .
299	0	a	Yeah .
300	1	a	So we might consider LCD screens .
301	0	a	Yeah , yeah , alright .
302	1	a	Well we will consider both and and see what what what we can find , I think .
303	0	a	No .
304	0	a	Alright .
305	0	a	Yep .
306	0	a	We do not rule them out yet .
307	0	a	Kay .
308	0	a	Alright .
309	0	a	, I think that is it .
310	0	a	I think it is sensible to u to take this take these points into the notes .
311	0	a	Alright .
312	0	a	Yes .
313	0	a	So you can
314	0	a	Right .
315	0	a	Well you
316	0	a	I c
317	0	a	I can still see your presentation .
318	0	a	Yeah .
319	0	a	Right .
320	0	a	It is in the
321	1	a	Well next I dunno who is next .
322	0	a	Yes .
323	1	a	Shall I give a technical talk ?
324	0	a	Alright .
325	1	a	Oh you go .
326	1	a	Well go ahead .
327	0	a	Well it is my task to explain or to point out a working design .
328	0	a	Yip .
329	0	a	We have that here .
330	0	a	Okay , how do you enlarge it , so that you can have the
331	0	a	F F five .
332	0	a	F five .
333	0	a	F five .
334	0	a	Yep .
335	0	a	Alright .
336	0	a	Well , the working design ,
337	0	a	that is my
338	0	a	Well alright , you know who I am and what I do .
339	0	a	Next button .
340	0	a	So we have this .
341	0	a	It is a bit unclear
342	0	a	because I wanted to copy paste something .
343	0	a	It was originally in black and white but it became black and purple .
344	0	a	Oh right .
345	0	a	Purple .
346	0	a	But I think you can read it .
347	0	a	Yeah ,
348	0	a	yeah ,
349	0	a	yeah .
350	0	a	well I think it is important for you to realise the basic function of a remote control .
351	0	a	A bit .
352	0	a	well you can see
353	1	a	And I then can select I can select on the dings
354	0	a	It goes to the next page .
355	1	a	Maybe you can select it .
356	1	a	So it inverts .
357	1	a	the p the whole picture .
358	0	a	Nah , never mind .
359	0	a	Click .
360	0	a	Well , you can read it ,
361	0	a	it is not too difficult .
362	1	a	Yeah , go ahead .
363	0	a	Meanwhile , this is a schematic view of how a basic remote control works .
364	0	a	You have basically the energy , the power of the of the remote control , and the sender , w which is the LED , the the the the the the the the the bulb that sends the the infrared beam to the , no , to the set .
365	0	a	Yeah .
366	0	a	Alright .
367	0	a	And the source is of course the user .
368	0	a	the user interface is the the the buttons of course .
369	0	a	And the the user interface sends the the different signals of the different buttons to the chip , and the chip sends it to the LED , and the LED sends it to the receiver .
370	0	a	That is the that is the basic idea .
371	0	a	Yep .
372	0	a	Very basic .
373	0	a	well I have put it in a in in in a a couple of basic steps .
374	0	a	the remote is basically just waiting for a user to press a key .
375	0	a	It does nothing until of course the key is pressed .
376	0	a	The key a signal to a chip , the chip senses the connection .
377	0	a	and recognise the key .
378	0	a	So well you understand .
379	0	a	The chip produces Morse code , a specific code to indicate that specific button that is pressed , of course .
380	0	a	And it uses transistors in the in the remote control to amplify and to send that signal again to the to the LED , which is the bulb , of course .
381	0	a	Now the LED produces an infrared beam and signals the , well it is very simple , and signals the signals to the sensor on the TV set , and the TV set also recognises the the the signal , and performs the assigned task .
382	0	a	Yeah .
383	0	a	So it is also why we have to have a button that says I am now busy with a DVD if we had done that .
384	0	a	And a button for TV .
385	0	a	bu
386	0	a	Yeah , but we do not .
387	0	a	we
388	0	a	No no ,
389	0	a	but Yeah .
390	0	a	So
391	0	a	Well but but
392	0	a	if you have the most used buttons all in one place , and you keep making the same well moves .
393	0	a	Exactly .
394	0	a	well this is the basic function of a remote .
395	0	a	I have some couple of pictures here .
396	0	a	It is a very basic one .
397	0	a	And if we if we are going to add an an LCD screen to it , it wo not look anything like this , but This is very basic basically the the shape of of a remote control .
398	0	a	It has very little buttons and
399	0	a	But it it it is it is quite
400	0	a	Yeah , you can easily recognise the buttons .
401	0	a	They are far enough apart and an anything .
402	0	a	It is not very not very high tech
403	0	a	indeed , and it is not very user friendly .
404	0	a	High tech .
405	0	a	if you look at the shape , it is just a simple long box shape .
406	1	a	So we have to change a little bit to that ,
407	0	a	so that it becomes more user friendly , and that problems like RSI and those kinds of thing do not do not oc do not occur .
408	0	a	Right .
409	1	a	Can I say something ?
410	0	a	I have a table here about the l the relevance of the buttons .
411	0	a	Yeah .
412	0	a	the power button is used very much , channel selection , volume and teletext .
413	0	a	Well teletext is not an option , so that
414	1	a	But I think it is very important to make the power , channel and volume buttons near to the thumb , so you ca not have RSI consequences .
415	0	a	Yeah ,
416	0	a	because they are the the most important buttons
417	0	a	and you can immediately
418	0	a	You do not have to look and and search for them .
419	0	a	Right .
420	1	a	Make them big , make them easy to to press .
421	0	a	You can also like Yeah , I was thinking you can Are some of the the the
422	1	a	Maybe you can make , for for channel changing , two little buttons on the side of the remote , so you can just do like this .
423	0	a	Right .
424	0	a	Yeah , right .
425	0	a	But if y if you would put it at a different place , then you have to move your hands , and that is on of the things about RSI .
426	0	a	Right .
427	0	a	Yeah , that is right .
428	0	a	That is right .
429	0	a	That is right .
430	0	a	Well you you ca not have any every button under the thumb , of course .
431	0	a	We But
432	0	a	Yeah .
433	0	a	No
434	1	a	but the most important buttons m maybe you can just put them a bit apart
435	1	a	so you would reject R RSI RSI .
436	0	a	That is very important .
437	0	a	And
438	0	a	But is that is that useable ?
439	0	a	Do people , when they pick up a remote , know that they have to do that ?
440	0	a	It is a f it is a new feature ,
441	1	a	you can make make a double feature l like a button on the top and under it .
442	0	a	Like some little Gameboy things or some
443	0	a	Well Yeah alright , but
444	0	a	Yeah ,
445	0	a	but if you s say them up and down
446	0	a	, they they will understand it , I think .
447	0	a	Yes
448	0	a	I have saw that on m on mi mobile telephones they also have those buttons .
449	0	a	Well it it is
450	0	a	Well also
451	0	a	i if someone puts picks up his remote
452	0	a	Yeah .
453	0	a	Yeah .
454	0	a	Eighty per cent would .
455	0	a	Well , .
456	0	a	If someone puts up i picks up his remote , and he picks up it
457	0	a	he he touches the side
458	0	a	then he is a already on the next channel .
459	0	a	Yeah , he feels it immediately .
460	0	a	Yeah that is true .
461	0	a	That is very irritating , I think .
462	0	a	Yeah , that is right .
463	0	a	Yeah .
464	0	a	Yeah
465	0	a	but
466	1	a	Right , continue .
467	0	a	Sorry .
468	1	a	But in e in any case the the basic function should be indeed , and as you say at the thumb .
469	0	a	I think that is a good idea ,
470	1	a	and and that the less important buttons , like the the the different channels , the numbers one
471	1	a	two three four five as well , should be
472	1	a	yeah
473	1	a	well not in reach ,
474	0	a	because they do not use it all the time .
475	0	a	Well it is pretty pretty basically as you said .
476	0	a	Yep .
477	0	a	And I have some pictures of the inside workings , but I do not want to get too technical , because that is not very useful for you .
478	0	a	Yeah , that is right .
479	0	a	That is your part of the job .
480	0	a	So yeah exactly
481	0	a	this is how it looks from the inside .
482	0	a	Yep .
483	0	a	And well that is about it I think .
484	0	a	Oh yeah , I still have this .
485	0	a	Oh I had to delete this , but I had to make a schematic of the of the new
486	0	a	But I had too too little time , but do not do not look at it please .
487	0	a	Alright .
488	0	a	Okay .
489	0	a	Well we understand .
490	0	a	Alright .
491	0	a	I I think it is it is clear how it works .
492	0	a	We understand .
493	0	a	Yeah , it is clear .
494	0	a	Alright .
495	0	a	Oh right , no .
496	0	a	That is the most important thing .
497	0	a	Nice .
498	0	a	Alright .
499	0	a	Then Mike can give the third presentation .
500	0	a	Right .
501	0	a	How late is did we start his presentation ?
502	0	a	Wha
503	0	a	Yeah .
504	0	a	I dunno .
505	0	a	I think w About twenty minutes ago ?
506	0	a	Losing time losing time .
507	0	a	Well then we have still the time ,
508	0	a	so But we do have to come to a decision , right later on .
509	0	a	Yeah right .
510	0	a	So
511	0	a	I do not think so .
512	0	a	So
513	0	a	Oh yeah ? ?
514	0	a	Okay ,
515	0	a	yeah
516	0	a	well .
517	0	a	Well I thought everybody on the website would see the same thing , but obviously that is not the case .
518	0	a	Yeah ,
519	0	a	there are different
520	0	a	We have all have different home pages , with different links .
521	0	a	Yeah .
522	0	a	Yeah .
523	0	a	Yeah right .
524	0	a	For instance you could not see this .
525	0	a	Yeah .
526	0	a	Well I am Mike , User Interface Designer .
527	0	a	The the method ?
528	0	a	Well I used my own experience with remotes , took a good l look at the remotes on the corporate website , which are these two .
529	0	a	Yeah .
530	0	a	Yes , these are from from another manufacturer .
531	0	a	These are already in use ?
532	0	a	Alright , okay .
533	0	a	This one is engineering centred , so this one has the most functions and things .
534	0	a	Yeah .
535	0	a	I like user centr centred also the best .
536	0	a	Well
537	0	a	Yeah , me too .
538	0	a	I like user centred .
539	0	a	Yeah .
540	0	a	We also do that .
541	0	a	Well , I thought that we reduce the the option to control the DVD also , and teletext and that kind of stuff .
542	0	a	so I thought we we we would use more or need more buttons than this one .
543	0	a	But we have to reject that , because of the requirements ?
544	0	a	Alright .
545	0	a	But
546	0	a	Yes .
547	0	a	Yeah .
548	0	a	Th that is why this is not relevant any more I feel .
549	0	a	I think this is about the maximum number of buttons we will need .
550	0	a	Yeah , right .
551	0	a	I I kind of like the shape .
552	0	a	I think this is what we talked about .
553	0	a	But
554	0	a	No
555	0	a	I have
556	0	a	Well I showed it somewhere .
557	0	a	Yeah .
558	0	a	You ca not really see the differ from different sides .
559	0	a	But I think
560	1	a	you can draw it if you
561	1	a	Yeah .
562	0	a	Oh yeah .
563	1	a	I think we should go further with the idea of a removable front .
564	0	a	So we can can yeah customise the
565	0	a	Yeah .
566	0	a	Well absolutely ,
567	0	a	but i th they all have to have something about the recognition from our company .
568	0	a	So we cannot just make someone w
569	0	a	No
570	0	a	but that is th the side they look look at is the front .
571	0	a	It is a front .
572	0	a	It is not the the whole remote that changes , of course .
573	0	a	But it
574	0	a	You can
575	0	a	So if y if you make a a front with just a a tiger on it , then our recognition is totally gone .
576	1	a	Or you can you can can put the same symbol on on every remote .
577	0	a	Yeah , that is right
578	0	a	Yeah , that is a must .
579	0	a	So l like Ericsson does every S something like this .
580	0	a	We must have that .
581	0	a	Yeah , we must .
582	1	a	We can put it on the on the back side .
583	0	a	Yeah well and and
584	0	a	Yes .
585	0	a	It is recognisable .
586	0	a	Kay .
587	1	a	We can make a symbol of the company right here .
588	0	a	Yeah ?
589	0	a	Yeah yeah .
590	0	a	And if you put a front on it , there is a hole on the front .
591	0	a	So the symbol is always on
592	0	a	Yeah .
593	0	a	Yeah , so that you do not replace the symbol , yeah .
594	0	a	Yeah
595	0	a	yeah
596	0	a	yeah .
597	0	a	Something like that ,
598	0	a	in the Yeah .
599	1	a	Or the th the the lowest part of the remote is not changed by the front .
600	0	a	Yeah ,
601	0	a	yeah .
602	1	a	But let is not focus on the front .
603	0	a	Yeah .
604	1	a	Those kind of things .
605	0	a	Yes .
606	0	a	Okay .
607	0	a	Well so like I said I thought we would we would use more function .
608	0	a	If we we had to include more functions .
609	0	a	But we do not .
610	0	a	So Yeah .
611	0	a	Alright .
612	1	a	I think this is about the maximum number of buttons we need .
613	1	a	Maybe some less .
614	0	a	Like eject we do not need , and some other buttons we do not need .
615	0	a	I think
616	1	a	Yeah , I will .
617	1	a	Mike , can you put that picture from me on the in the Word documents file ?
618	1	a	In Map ?
619	0	a	The younger
620	0	a	I think for the remote less is more .
621	0	a	The less buttons the better the design .
622	1	a	We should go with that concept I think .
623	0	a	Yeah .
624	0	a	Yeah , I agree .
625	0	a	I know .
626	0	a	Alright .
627	1	a	I have I have got another point .
628	0	a	Yeah ?
629	0	a	Well what if we
630	0	a	I at I at home have a remote that has the most familiar buttons on the top , and the bottom side of the front has a little clip ,
631	0	a	a f a little
632	0	a	You can click away and then you have f much more functions that most people do not use
633	0	a	but s some do do .
634	0	a	there are two target audi audiences , and we have chose for the younger one .
635	0	a	, research has shown that it is a high interested in features .
636	0	a	They are high high interested in feature .
637	0	a	But they are more critical .
638	0	a	Fo
639	0	a	Yeah , critical .
640	0	a	So
641	0	a	The younger audience .
642	1	a	So we must must design a control that really speaks to the people .
643	0	a	I think the most functions underneath that
644	0	a	No
645	0	a	usually But Yeah I think m most Most
646	0	a	Clip are not used much .
647	0	a	Well but because you say they their features are important , they want m a lot ,
648	0	a	but not
649	0	a	Yeah .
650	0	a	Yeah right .
651	0	a	Yeah ,
652	1	a	but what kind of features ?
653	1	a	Like LCD screens and voice recognition .
654	0	a	Yeah
655	0	a	but Yeah .
656	0	a	But I have
657	0	a	Yeah , that is nice .
658	1	a	Here , look at these numbers .
659	0	a	The newest features are , like I said , are LCD and speech control .
660	0	a	Our audience , these people , are very like these features .
661	0	a	You see ?
662	0	a	So we must build in something , or they will to go to the concurrent .
663	0	a	Yeah .
664	0	a	The concurrent ?
665	0	a	Competitors , right .
666	0	a	Our competitor .
667	0	a	Competitors .
668	0	a	Yeah .
669	0	a	So , I do think we have to have some features .
670	0	a	Yeah .
671	0	a	Even though they cost a little more .
672	0	a	Well maybe w we could s
673	0	a	On some calculators you have lo those little little LCD th that you can click on or something , or that you can click out of the remote .
674	0	a	Right .
675	0	a	Right .
676	0	a	And if if that is gives you a little bit of sta status information .
677	1	a	Like a ticker tape .
678	0	a	Yeah .
679	1	a	Which programme you are l watching or something .
680	1	a	Those kind of things ,
681	0	a	because you also have those those program recognition for your V VCRs .
682	1	a	And well if y if your remote picks that up also , you they can display which programme you are currently watching .
683	0	a	Yeah , right .
684	0	a	Yeah .
685	0	a	Yeah right .
686	0	a	Yeah .
687	1	a	So it it just signals the the different sig the different symbols on the screen you have , because if you change to s channel two you have two on the screen and two on your on your on your LCD screen .
688	0	a	Yeah .
689	0	a	For example .
690	1	a	It it could be such a little th that you can click in and out and you and you have it .
691	0	a	Yeah ,
692	1	a	we should keep that simple too .
693	0	a	But should it really be clickable ,
694	1	a	or or just integrate inside to try to make it d more trendy .
695	0	a	It will
696	0	a	No ,
697	1	a	it should be integrated .
698	0	a	Yeah .
699	0	a	No not clickable .
700	0	a	Well maybe .
701	0	a	Nah , no no no .
702	0	a	I think
703	0	a	Yeah ,
704	1	a	something like on some radios in car .
705	0	a	Yeah ,
706	1	a	just at at the top .
707	0	a	So when you s you sit like this you can can watch .
708	1	a	I think it should be at the top .
709	0	a	Yeah .
710	0	a	Yeah .
711	0	a	You
712	0	a	Where it is , yeah , walking to
713	0	a	Yeah .
714	0	a	Yeah right .
715	0	a	It is a ticker tape idea .
716	1	a	RDSs or something .
717	0	a	But that is of course a bit more expensive than the basic calculator design , with the scrolling text and that kind of thing .
718	0	a	Wa Yeah .
719	0	a	Well it is just one script .
720	0	a	Well I think it is you got
721	0	a	It just means it is a script that is keeps it rolling , and it is not That is five minutes off implementing time I think
722	0	a	Yeah .
723	0	a	Yeah , five minutes of ja ja for programming .
724	0	a	So I do not think that is the issue .
725	0	a	No .
726	0	a	Alright .
727	0	a	Alright , we go with the LCD screen ?
728	0	a	Kay .
729	0	a	well I think so , yes .
730	0	a	Yeah well we we we still need to know how much that will cost .
731	0	a	We are g
732	1	a	No
733	1	a	but we are we will have to look into that .
734	0	a	Right ,
735	0	a	I do not know if I can find that , but
736	1	a	Next time .
737	1	a	Or maybe you will get that information
738	0	a	Yeah .
739	1	a	we can use this board again , I think .
740	0	a	Yeah right .
741	1	a	we can put some decisions about the controls we want , th the issue .
742	0	a	Where is my presentation ?
743	0	a	Well
744	0	a	I mean we are all here now , I think .
745	0	a	Yeah , I understand what you are saying .
746	1	a	We should have a general idea of how it is going to look .
747	0	a	These I have already given you .
748	0	a	So we have to decide on the different remote control functions .
749	0	a	Right .
750	1	a	So we want to have a small LCD screen that is special .
751	1	a	At the top .
752	1	a	Should not we start with the most important parts ?
753	0	a	The LCD screen alright
754	1	a	but we should start with the power button ?
755	0	a	Huh ?
756	0	a	And then
757	1	a	Maybe we should centralise the discussion here .
758	0	a	At the top or at the bottom ?
759	0	a	Yeah
760	0	a	but
761	0	a	Yeah but with with the LCD screen on the top it gets a bit unnatural .
762	0	a	Yes .
763	0	a	I think the top is more
764	0	a	When you s How do you zap ?
765	1	a	You just sit in your chair ?
766	1	a	With the remote ?
767	0	a	Yeah but that is where your hand ball might be .
768	0	a	Yeah .
769	0	a	That thing is terrible .
770	0	a	Cause most remotes have some space left at the bottom .
771	0	a	Well
772	0	a	Well I th
773	0	a	I think Mike Mike has a point ,
774	0	a	because when when when I use a remote
775	0	a	I
776	0	a	l
777	0	a	I hate the buttons but buttons at the at the bottom .
778	0	a	Yeah , I dunno .
779	0	a	Yeah , no .
780	1	a	We will draw two , and then we will see
781	0	a	No he thinks
782	0	a	Yeah , right .
783	0	a	I dunno what you were talking about but we are busy with something .
784	0	a	He thinks it is better to put the LCD at the bottom , and I think it is better at the top .
785	0	a	Uh huh .
786	0	a	Why do you think it is better at the bottom ?
787	1	a	But you just can put the the the the the whole interface a bit down ,
788	0	a	so that there is room for the for the interface .
789	0	a	well because most remotes have some space left at the bottom , and that way you can keep the shape recognisable for everybody .
790	0	a	But your
791	0	a	Yeah .
792	0	a	I c
793	0	a	Well I d I think that is that is ugly but
794	0	a	I th
795	0	a	Yeah .
796	0	a	The the ticker The LCD is like like small .
797	0	a	It is it is wide .
798	0	a	It is not not high .
799	0	a	Uh huh .
800	0	a	But
801	0	a	Yeah right .
802	0	a	And and we can
803	0	a	Bottom .
804	0	a	Power button always
805	0	a	Yeah .
806	0	a	Yeah .
807	0	a	So and
808	0	a	and I
809	0	a	I like to use the ones on the top .
810	1	a	Yeah , y you gotta zap like this
811	0	a	or you want to
812	0	a	Yeah .
813	0	a	So when I u when I have to have an LCD s scr window
814	0	a	Yes
815	0	a	but we we we
816	0	a	we do not want that .
817	0	a	But We are making a remote with with a few functions you know .
818	0	a	Well that is a bit exaggerated .
819	0	a	Well , I agree with you .
820	0	a	It is it is also more recognisable .
821	0	a	We High tech .
822	0	a	It looks more like a calculator to people , if you have the l the the the thing on top .
823	0	a	Yeah you do not want
824	0	a	You want
825	0	a	Yeah
826	0	a	it it
827	0	a	it must be a remote .
828	0	a	We do not want them to look like a calculator .
829	0	a	We want to look it like our original but familiar
830	0	a	Yea
831	1	a	Maybe a bic better white We White ?
832	0	a	Width .
833	0	a	Yeah w well ,
834	0	a	but you do not have to throw important aspe important aspect like familiarity completely away ,
835	0	a	because I think it is
836	0	a	I think it is still important to have it at the top , because it is it is more familiar that way .
837	0	a	Yeah .
838	0	a	Width .
839	1	a	format
840	1	a	yeah format ?
841	1	a	Line width ?
842	1	a	Width ?
843	0	a	Yeah ?
844	0	a	It is a bit off .
845	0	a	Th that is not a problem .
846	0	a	When I draw here it
847	0	a	Oh .
848	0	a	Huh ?
849	0	a	Yeah , it is off .
850	0	a	Well .
851	0	a	A little a little bit .
852	0	a	It it needs to be calibrated again .
853	1	a	Well let is talk about that later
854	0	a	It is special pen .
855	0	a	Well
856	0	a	Where ?
857	0	a	Alright , we have to make a decision now , because we do not have much time .
858	1	a	Maybe you should another pen .
859	1	a	Maybe that is better .
860	0	a	You e you only have one pen for that screen .
861	0	a	Yeah .
862	0	a	Yeah .
863	0	a	No .
864	0	a	I think we have a few functions , and we can put the LCD above it , and still have lots of room at the bottom , where you can put your hand .
865	0	a	Yeah .
866	0	a	I I agree .
867	1	a	I think it should be at the button , bottom .
868	0	a	Well I am the I
869	0	a	I am the designer , so
870	0	a	Yeah .
871	0	a	At the bottom ?
872	0	a	In a few minutes
873	0	a	Oh yeah ,
874	0	a	oh yeah , I totally agree .
875	0	a	Bottom .
876	0	a	The LCD .
877	0	a	At the bot
878	0	a	So
879	0	a	We are two VS two .
880	0	a	Yeah .
881	0	a	Yeah .
882	1	a	Well but what what if we we first decide the different functions , and then look at the design .
883	0	a	He is the boss .
884	0	a	Right .
885	0	a	Great .
886	0	a	we we were busy with that .
887	0	a	Because we have to decide this .
888	1	a	yeah we should summon the the different aspects of the thing .
889	0	a	Yeah .
890	0	a	So , we have the power button .
891	1	a	And moreover I think that you two should be come to consensus about the LCD s .
892	0	a	Yes .
893	0	a	It is your it is your job .
894	0	a	Yeah of course .
895	0	a	it is .
896	0	a	No it is our job .
897	0	a	Yeah .
898	0	a	Well we have a power button .
899	0	a	W wh
900	0	a	While you have to agree , I can say it is like this
901	0	a	and you must agree .
902	0	a	Guys ?
903	0	a	Guys ?
904	0	a	We have a power button , setting buttons , LCD window , the number buttons
905	0	a	Yes .
906	0	a	For all of us I think .
907	0	a	Yeah , right .
908	1	a	Alright , let is keep it central .
909	0	a	Yeah .
910	0	a	The ten numbers ?
911	0	a	Yeah ?
912	0	a	Volume ?
913	1	a	I think we we should use something like this to The the channel up and channel down button ?
914	1	a	Yeah , in circle , you know ?
915	1	a	And and a volume control also in it .
916	0	a	Channel ,
917	0	a	yeah .
918	0	a	Volume control .
919	1	a	Well let is look at your design .
920	0	a	the mute button .
921	0	a	Uh huh .
922	0	a	I h love that one .
923	0	a	Yes .
924	0	a	Yeah .
925	0	a	Yeah
926	0	a	yeah
927	0	a	yeah .
928	0	a	Well that is that is also design .
929	0	a	Yes .
930	0	a	Right .
931	0	a	Well h ho
932	0	a	Yes .
933	0	a	Yeah .
934	0	a	But th th on this remote th these controls are for something else , a DVD player or something .
935	0	a	Yes .
936	0	a	Yes ,
937	1	a	as I already said , we could drop some of these buttons .
938	0	a	They are for some video
939	1	a	Apart .
940	0	a	So
941	0	a	Yeah ,
942	0	a	it is it is also not good to completely stay in one position constantly with one hand .
943	1	a	You should put that power button , channel and volume should have the most importance .
944	0	a	Yeah .
945	1	a	I think these should be in one big circle in the middle .
946	0	a	Yeah , but what he said about RSI was t kind of true .
947	0	a	When when you put them all in the same place , the most used buttons , you are doing the same thing all the time , and that is just what RSI is all about .
948	1	a	So it might be smarter to put them a little more away from each other .
949	0	a	So people have to move their hand .
950	0	a	And they get less complaints of RSI .
951	0	a	Y
952	0	a	Yeah .
953	0	a	That is what I always do , because all my i important buttons are the same place .
954	0	a	It is good to move from time to time .
955	0	a	Yeah .
956	0	a	Yeah but people do not like it when their buttons are all over the place .
957	0	a	Frequency of button use .
958	0	a	Yes ?
959	0	a	Well not
960	0	a	Yes .
961	0	a	They they need to be centred .
962	0	a	No but now y
963	1	a	W would we have to choose a way in middle ?
964	0	a	channels are most is most used within the hour .
965	0	a	Uh huh .
966	0	a	Volume hardly .
967	0	a	You can see .
968	1	a	So the the channel channel buttons should be far far apart , I think , up and down .
969	0	a	No I do not think .
970	0	a	Oh .
971	0	a	Up and down far apart from each other ?
972	1	a	Well not too much .
973	0	a	Far apart ?
974	1	a	I think you can have the two buttons of up and down close together , but you do not have have to have volume control and and zapping button close together .
975	0	a	You
976	0	a	thinking about RSI ?
977	1	a	Y look at look at the frequency .
978	0	a	Yeah
979	0	a	but Yeah
980	0	a	but
981	0	a	No .
982	0	a	Nei not too much , but Nei nei
983	0	a	nei
984	0	a	n I I totally agree .
985	0	a	The other the other two frustrations are far more important .
986	0	a	So Well they are used four times an hour , so Power bu button should be left at the top .
987	0	a	Well for example the power button ,
988	0	a	you can
989	0	a	If someone is constantly z zapping , it is not going to miss , that it that the power button is not right beside it .
990	0	a	Because I have someone
991	0	a	But the buttons is way .
992	1	a	So that one can be put away .
993	0	a	But just
994	0	a	Yeah .
995	0	a	Right .
996	0	a	Yeah .
997	0	a	I agree .
998	1	a	The power button can be
999	0	a	Yes .
1000	0	a	And should and should be red .
1001	0	a	Yeah .
1002	0	a	Oh man ,
1003	0	a	five minutes .
1004	0	a	Yeah ,
1005	0	a	well five minutes left .
1006	1	a	Right , just make some decisions .
1007	0	a	Yep .
1008	0	a	The most important things we have to
1009	1	a	I do think you have to keep you have to keep it central now .
1010	1	a	how are we going to do it with those numbers ?
1011	0	a	Well I have it here .
1012	0	a	C c can you make you make
1013	1	a	We can use the drawing board now , I think .
1014	0	a	it it does not work well
1015	0	a	but But it it would be pretty pretty nice if we could just draw a simple thing .
1016	0	a	Yeah well that is going to take too too much time .
1017	1	a	Just you decide that , you decide that ,
1018	0	a	and ready .
1019	0	a	Yes .
1020	0	a	Yeah .
1021	0	a	Yes .
1022	0	a	Alright .
1023	0	a	Well the LCD .
1024	0	a	you are Industrial , you are User Interface .
1025	0	a	So I think it is going to go to Mike .
1026	0	a	Yeah .
1027	1	a	But you will have to make consensus with .
1028	0	a	Well
1029	0	a	Well it is a bit hard ,
1030	0	a	because we are going to be individually .
1031	1	a	Well consensus , We we can put it in the middle , so
1032	0	a	Alright .
1033	0	a	Nei .
1034	0	a	We are No
1035	0	a	We are deciding now , so
1036	0	a	Top or bottom ?
1037	0	a	Okay .
1038	0	a	That is a bit
1039	0	a	Yes .
1040	0	a	Well yeah I
1041	0	a	I still think it is it is quite important though to to have it at the top , so
1042	0	a	Yeah .
1043	0	a	Yes it is .
1044	0	a	You say familiarity is not important but
1045	0	a	Yeah d
1046	0	a	Yeah .
1047	1	a	Well what if we are going to now decide about the functions , and the design comes into the next round ?
1048	0	a	Plus the d th the design round is still to come huh ?
1049	0	a	Alright these functions .
1050	0	a	Yeah , right .
1051	0	a	Okay .
1052	0	a	As we we we we agreed , we do have a LCD .
1053	0	a	The number f
1054	0	a	Well yes , that is alright .
1055	0	a	So that is that is enough .
1056	0	a	Yeah , okay .
1057	0	a	W the number function .
1058	0	a	Yeah .
1059	1	a	Are we going to do it like on Mike is screen with one button that says I am going to do a t two number digital ?
1060	1	a	How do you want it to do then ?
1061	1	a	It it has to r recognise one as there could still come more .
1062	0	a	No .
1063	0	a	There is one two three four five six six seven eight nine zero .
1064	0	a	Well just when you push a one one and
1065	0	a	No ,
1066	0	a	if you
1067	0	a	On most TVs if you press two numbers shortly after each other , d it
1068	0	a	Yeah .
1069	0	a	Oh , like that .
1070	0	a	They would recognise it .
1071	0	a	Yes .
1072	0	a	Th that is the most
1073	0	a	That that is very easy .
1074	0	a	Alright so no button for that .
1075	0	a	Yeah .
1076	0	a	Yeah .
1077	0	a	No .
1078	0	a	Yeah .
1079	0	a	Okay anyone any oth other functionalities of our remote ?
1080	0	a	So
1081	0	a	No ,
1082	0	a	we would just said we did not
1083	0	a	Well
1084	0	a	well because we ca not integrate it with any other remotes , all those buttons on those pictures are irrelevant .
1085	0	a	I think these are the the most important functions .
1086	0	a	Do you still have the pictures over there ?
1087	0	a	Yeah , that is about it .
1088	0	a	Yeah .
1089	0	a	You do need the multi Or did
1090	0	a	No , like this one .
1091	1	a	You do need them ?
1092	0	a	Yeah , I know .
1093	0	a	But are we
1094	0	a	Alright , alright
1095	0	a	Now okay .
1096	0	a	Right .
1097	0	a	So just for a television is
1098	0	a	that all we need ?
1099	0	a	Teletext is gone .
1100	0	a	Yeah , it is most useable this way .
1101	0	a	Yeah .
1102	0	a	basic function .
1103	0	a	So all those buttons that ar are to do with teletext
1104	0	a	Oh screen placing .
1105	0	a	We will have those buttons about
1106	0	a	And the two important ones we are l f forgetting .
1107	0	a	there is screen .
1108	0	a	You can make it wider and less wide .
1109	0	a	Yeah .
1110	0	a	And the button that you can go to AV for your video .
1111	0	a	Right .
1112	1	a	I do think we have to put that underneath a clip .
1113	0	a	Oh yeah .
1114	0	a	Those two ?
1115	0	a	But it is just two , and we make a clip ?
1116	0	a	Th that is a bit waste .
1117	0	a	just two just two under under I
1118	0	a	I think
1119	0	a	But you you can put two or three buttons under another section .
1120	1	a	We we can make make a little row of like four buttons down here .
1121	0	a	Yes .
1122	0	a	Yeah .
1123	0	a	Okay , right .
1124	0	a	Or at the top .
1125	0	a	Your LCD screen is going to go .
1126	0	a	Or at
1127	0	a	Yeah alright then .
1128	0	a	that is that is too complicated .
1129	0	a	Yes .
1130	0	a	You can just put it somewhere
1131	0	a	They they are not used much , not as much as those other , so you can put it somewhere
1132	0	a	Yeah s bit smaller and s
1133	1	a	Well and and I think more at the bottom .
1134	0	a	Yeah
1135	0	a	Well I think they should in an in an isolated part of the remote .
1136	1	a	Oh , they can be small or round like buttons .
1137	1	a	Yeah .
1138	1	a	Yeah or at the top
1139	1	a	, yeah .
1140	0	a	What do you think those those buttons ?
1141	0	a	Above or down ?
1142	0	a	And w where ?
1143	0	a	Well we design it later .
1144	0	a	We have it , and we design later where everything goes .
1145	0	a	Yes ?
1146	0	a	Yes .
1147	0	a	Yeah .
1148	0	a	Yes .
1149	0	a	Well any other
1150	0	a	Go to video , that is always on your remote control .
1151	0	a	Well if you you take those th
1152	0	a	If you
1153	0	a	Yeah , but you can z you can zap t
1154	0	a	you can you can zap to the video channel from zero to
1155	0	a	Yeah ,
1156	0	a	but when you zap down zero you get to AV .
1157	0	a	Why go to video ?
1158	0	a	That is just zero .
1159	0	a	To AV to AV
1160	0	a	AV AV .
1161	0	a	The the video channel ?
1162	0	a	No no not always .
1163	0	a	Yeah .
1164	0	a	Well l n no not at not at my remote .
1165	0	a	Ze yeah zero is a different channel than the the video channel .
1166	0	a	Yeah .
1167	0	a	Yeah , but you can can zap down
1168	0	a	Yes , I think th
1169	0	a	No , then you press ninety nine .
1170	0	a	Yes .
1171	0	a	I do not .
1172	0	a	I go to ninety nine .
1173	0	a	well whatever , .
1174	0	a	I think go to video is an irrelevant button , but
1175	0	a	Yeah well y you must have .
1176	0	a	Th that is the button
1177	0	a	No .
1178	0	a	But it is easy to go
1179	0	a	If you are at at channel fifty five and you want to go immediately to the video channel , you do you have to push a to to get below zero .
1180	0	a	No you can ch push zero .
1181	0	a	It is more easy to get to where the specific video channel button .
1182	0	a	Yeah .
1183	0	a	Yeah ,
1184	0	a	I I think that one button is I use it
1185	0	a	Yeah ?
1186	0	a	These buttons , I do not have buttons for channel setting especially on my remote .
1187	0	a	Yeah , but if we are choosing to incorporate these buttons , you have to have channel setting , if you wa if you have a new TV .
1188	0	a	You have to set the channels .
1189	0	a	Right all th these different buttons you have to , I do .
1190	0	a	Yeah well d different screen settings a Yeah , sk
1191	0	a	Yeah y you
1192	0	a	you
1193	0	a	you
1194	0	a	you have screen width .
1195	0	a	It is it is incorporated with p m plus and down , those
1196	0	a	So we still have one four ?
1197	0	a	Ch ch
1198	0	a	Okay .
1199	0	a	Yeah you
1200	0	a	yeah
1201	0	a	you have one one button from s set frequency o or something , and then with plus and min
1202	0	a	minus you can adjust the
1203	0	a	Yeah , alright .
1204	0	a	Right .
1205	0	a	That is the only one we put in there .
1206	0	a	For a screen fu channel setting .
1207	0	a	Yeah to oh yeah of course
1208	0	a	to configure the programme
1209	0	a	the Yeah .
1210	0	a	Programme , right .
1211	0	a	Oh the Okay button ?
1212	0	a	Oh you always have in the centre an Okay button , for your menu .
1213	0	a	Yeah .
1214	0	a	Menu button .
1215	0	a	You should
1216	0	a	Yeah .
1217	0	a	I think that is important .
1218	0	a	And and the settings to change the brightness the settings to change the brightness and the contrast .
1219	0	a	Channel , setting , menu .
1220	0	a	We have to go .
1221	0	a	Okay .
1222	0	a	Channel ,
1223	0	a	yeah .
1224	0	a	So Save .
1225	1	a	Chief ?
1226	1	a	Chief ?
1227	0	a	Th the menu menu button is also important .
1228	0	a	Yes see .
1229	0	a	Then you can
1230	0	a	Where ?
1231	0	a	I do not see it .
1232	0	a	Yes
1233	0	a	I have put it in .
1234	0	a	Here .
1235	0	a	Oh Menu , alright .
1236	1	a	I think things like contrast and brightness should be in the menu ,
1237	1	a	yeah .
1238	1	a	In the menu .
1239	1	a	And you can then adjust it with the zapping buttons or something .
1240	0	a	Yeah , the
1241	1	a	Or the volume or something like that .
1242	0	a	Because the zapping buttons are not used then if you are in the menu .
1243	0	a	Alright .
1244	0	a	Guys ?
1245	0	a	We are going to go to our rooms , and we will have to decide s things on our own I think .
1246	0	a	Yeah .
1247	0	a	Or the volume , yeah .
1248	0	a	Your pen .
1249	0	a	Great .
1250	0	a	So
1251	0	a	Well see you
1252	0	a	W w we have lunchtime , by the way , now so
1253	0	a	Lunch .
1254	0	a	Yes chief .
1255	0	a	Alright .
1256	0	a	I thought we would lunch right now , or not ?
1257	0	a	Yeah this is this is your thing .
1258	0	a	Okay .
1259	0	a	I am hungry .
1260	0	a	 
1261	0	a	Okay .
1262	0	a	door is closed .
1263	1	a	Well , let is begin .
1264	0	a	Because if we have as much time as the last meeting , we will have to hurry up .
1265	0	a	I am listening .
1266	0	a	Right .
1267	1	a	well I will start with the presentation again , the agenda .
1268	0	a	Great .
1269	0	a	Yo .
1270	0	a	So .
1271	0	a	This one I think .
1272	0	a	yeah .
1273	0	a	Well alright .
1274	1	a	well , I will show you the notes .
1275	0	a	It is not as interesting as it should be
1276	0	a	because we just had the meeting ,
1277	1	a	but I will show them .
1278	0	a	We will get your presentations again on the conceptual design .
1279	0	a	Then we will have to dec decide about the control , the remote control concepts .
1280	0	a	I have put a f a file in the project management folder , which says exactly what kind of decisions we should take .
1281	0	a	So this time we exactly know what to decide about .
1282	0	a	Alright , great .
1283	0	a	And then we will close again .
1284	0	a	Alright .
1285	0	a	Well these are some examples ,
1286	1	a	but we will talk about them later .
1287	1	a	We will first look at your presentations .
1288	1	a	Alright ?
1289	1	a	Walter will start again this time ?
1290	0	a	Yo .
1291	0	a	Yeah , great .
1292	0	a	Alright , Trendwatch .
1293	0	a	Kay .
1294	0	a	Right .
1295	0	a	I will speak about latest trends trends , latest fashion updates , and things we must not do .
1296	0	a	Kay .
1297	0	a	the trends .
1298	0	a	It is very important that the control is fancy looking and good feeling .
1299	0	a	this because of our last model was very functional , but it people did not like that , so our new mo model must be very good looking .
1300	0	a	That is something you have to take a look at .
1301	0	a	Alright .
1302	0	a	And the feeling has to be very great .
1303	0	a	Also the menus and things like that they have to they have to feel great .
1304	0	a	Alright .
1305	0	a	there is a minus two times here , because this is the most important point .
1306	0	a	This is two times as less important , and same for this one .
1307	0	a	Less .
1308	0	a	, technological technological innovations , that is regarded very highly too .
1309	0	a	such as an LCD screen , speech acknowledgement , as we talked about earlier .
1310	0	a	Well , yeah .
1311	0	a	So we have to have something like that ,
1312	0	a	like we
1313	0	a	Right .
1314	0	a	LCD and our our fronts .
1315	0	a	the last point is easy to use .
1316	0	a	Well I think that speaks for s for itself .
1317	1	a	I do not know who is who is going to look at that .
1318	0	a	Easy to use ?
1319	0	a	I think that is your ta
1320	0	a	Well , easy to use s is a bit contradictionary with the first Functional is not an issue , and then easy to use .
1321	0	a	Yeah ?
1322	0	a	Yeah , I know .
1323	0	a	Well we have to choose one of them .
1324	0	a	I think we have to go for the first one .
1325	0	a	Yeah .
1326	0	a	It is the most important one .
1327	0	a	So we have to take that one .
1328	0	a	Okay .
1329	0	a	So it it it is not very important that that it works easy .
1330	0	a	Well something fancy looking can be can be easy to use .
1331	0	a	But it has to look great .
1332	0	a	Yeah .
1333	0	a	We will we will look at .
1334	0	a	We will see .
1335	0	a	You
1336	0	a	Yeah .
1337	0	a	Yeah , yeah ,
1338	0	a	you can make a very complicated remote anyway , so ease of use
1339	0	a	It is not a very comp complicated device .
1340	0	a	Yeah , right .
1341	0	a	But the most important thing is that it looks great and people say wow , that is real great great concept .
1342	0	a	Alright .
1343	0	a	Kay .
1344	0	a	Alright .
1345	0	a	these are the new colours of this year .
1346	0	a	So it must be very bright , very colourful .
1347	0	a	People like this .
1348	0	a	So we we have to think in this direction .
1349	1	a	So i set your mind to it .
1350	0	a	So
1351	0	a	Well
1352	0	a	Yeah ,
1353	0	a	well Yeah .
1354	0	a	Findings ?
1355	0	a	Fashion update ?
1356	0	a	Fruit and vegetables are cool .
1357	0	a	I am told .
1358	0	a	you think ?
1359	0	a	The group we are targeting is very pleased with fruit and vegetables .
1360	1	a	So we we we might cons consider in front of in in that sort of way .
1361	1	a	Bananas .
1362	0	a	furthermore material , that is your part , should be very strong .
1363	1	a	I was thinking of something like well iron plate over it , maybe in a colour or something ,
1364	0	a	that looks so f really flashy but
1365	0	a	it it is also strong .
1366	0	a	And that is also for the younger public .
1367	0	a	B
1368	0	a	Well the the handy thing about our fronts is that we can follow these trends e ev every year .
1369	0	a	Th this year it is fruits but next year it is it is something totally different .
1370	0	a	Yeah , that is great .
1371	0	a	Yeah .
1372	1	a	But I think we can all make the the fronts of titanium or something really thin .
1373	0	a	Yes .
1374	0	a	So it looks very heavy but you can still use it very easily .
1375	0	a	Yep , alright .
1376	0	a	Well , the do nots .
1377	0	a	Older people like dark colours and simple shapes .
1378	0	a	Well we do not want older people , we want young people .
1379	0	a	So we are going to turn that around .
1380	0	a	We are going to have real cool shapes and lots of colours .
1381	0	a	Alright .
1382	0	a	Right ?
1383	0	a	Okay .
1384	0	a	Wood is popular .
1385	0	a	Aha .
1386	0	a	We do not want wood .
1387	0	a	Yeah , among the old people , yeah .
1388	0	a	Yeah
1389	0	a	yeah
1390	0	a	yeah .
1391	0	a	Old people .
1392	0	a	So , that is it for me .
1393	0	a	Alright .
1394	0	a	Nice , well show us .
1395	0	a	Right , I am going to tell you something about the components design .
1396	0	a	again I have put up the specification properties .
1397	0	a	This so the different components of the of of the device .
1398	0	a	And the materials ?
1399	0	a	I have heard several things ,
1400	1	a	so I I will have to change that on the way .
1401	0	a	But the case ?
1402	0	a	I suggested in the previous meeting hard plastic .
1403	0	a	But as you indicated it should be strong .
1404	0	a	Yeah , we should change that .
1405	0	a	It should feel strong .
1406	0	a	So maybe plastic is not sufficient .
1407	0	a	We should move to something
1408	0	a	Well yeah .
1409	0	a	Well maybe it it it is , but it does not look strong .
1410	0	a	So maybe
1411	0	a	But we still have to look at our price of course .
1412	0	a	Y Hard plastic i is of course pretty pretty tough , but it does not have a really really tough look .
1413	0	a	No no no .
1414	0	a	So
1415	0	a	Yeah .
1416	0	a	Because if we want an LCD window etcetera
1417	0	a	Yeah ?
1418	0	a	Yes .
1419	0	a	Also
1420	0	a	Yeah .
1421	1	a	But we will return to that .
1422	0	a	the buttons of course rubber , I think everyone agrees .
1423	0	a	And electrical cables , copper is all pretty basic stuff .
1424	0	a	The chips made of silicon , I guess .
1425	0	a	I think that is the best way to do it .
1426	0	a	And infra infrared l LED is just a simple bulb .
1427	0	a	Then I have had a few findings , made a few findings .
1428	0	a	the target audience product style .
1429	0	a	it is generally the case that senior and wealthy people above forty five years old like , as you said , particularly the traditional materials as such as wood and materials such as that .
1430	0	a	They also like straightforward shapes and luxurious style .
1431	0	a	But of course that is not our things this .
1432	0	a	So this is things we must not do .
1433	0	a	And then we have young and dynamic people , which is of course our group , the people we aim at .
1434	0	a	under forty five years old .
1435	0	a	they like soft materials with primary colours .
1436	0	a	Soft materials is of course agai again a bit a contradiction with our material choice of what you said , that it should be hard an and and and and strong looking .
1437	0	a	Yeah .
1438	0	a	But they like soft materials ,
1439	1	a	so we might we have to consider that .
1440	0	a	Yeah .
1441	0	a	And also they like curved round shapes .
1442	0	a	So not too formal like like the older people want .
1443	0	a	And if also a finding but not very ap applicable here , that sports and gaming devices such as discmans for jogging and that those kind of devices , gaming devices , should define the characteristics of the device .
1444	0	a	But since we do not have a really a sports or gaming device , so we do not really have to consider that .
1445	1	a	Sports , they are that are accessible on on your LCD window
1446	0	a	Huh ?
1447	0	a	That is nice .
1448	1	a	Soccer fronts .
1449	0	a	Well I also have several examples of styles , so you can get a clear picture of what I mean .
1450	0	a	All the results ?
1451	0	a	Yeah .
1452	0	a	We keep coming back to the fronts .
1453	0	a	Yeah .
1454	0	a	these are the basic older older peoples' stuff .
1455	0	a	Yeah .
1456	0	a	Yeah .
1457	0	a	It was not very interesting ,
1458	0	a	very classical looking , but that is n that is not what we want .
1459	0	a	We have these kind of things .
1460	0	a	I do not know what exactly they are .
1461	0	a	It looks like
1462	0	a	Well you know you recognise the shapes , it is very primary colours , bright colours and round shapes .
1463	0	a	Nai .
1464	0	a	no .
1465	0	a	You also see this device , it is not very round and
1466	0	a	Fruity of course .
1467	0	a	Fruity .
1468	0	a	Fruity .
1469	0	a	Yeah , it
1470	0	a	That is true .
1471	0	a	It is t terrible .
1472	0	a	Alright .
1473	0	a	And well round shapes , primary colours .
1474	0	a	You can see it all here .
1475	0	a	And of course this famous device .
1476	0	a	Yeah , alright .
1477	0	a	I think as you know something some devices like this .
1478	0	a	So to give you an idea of
1479	0	a	This has a strong look .
1480	0	a	Well it is got a strong look , this .
1481	0	a	Although it is plastic , it is it is grey to to to give it iron look .
1482	0	a	Yeah .
1483	0	a	Yeah , it still has a strong look .
1484	0	a	Yeah .
1485	0	a	And it is round .
1486	0	a	That is
1487	0	a	Yeah .
1488	0	a	But then you are losing your fruity colours .
1489	0	a	Well we have to make a
1490	0	a	Well we ca not really make a round a round remote control .
1491	1	a	Well you can make th th th that middle ring
1492	1	a	can you you can make another colour .
1493	0	a	That is true .
1494	1	a	So those kind of things you can you can combine .
1495	0	a	I do not think that is very practical ,
1496	0	a	but But it is important to to to think about the colour .
1497	0	a	No , it is not .
1498	0	a	Okay .
1499	0	a	Because if we make it grey or or silvery looking , it it does make it a lot more does make it looking a lot more stronger .
1500	0	a	Yeah but the
1501	0	a	But it does not have to look strong .
1502	0	a	Yes .
1503	0	a	Cause if you look at this , it it does not look very very strong , becau
1504	0	a	But this is plastic , and and this too , but
1505	0	a	The feel ?
1506	0	a	alright .
1507	0	a	The the results are , the feel of the material is expected to be strongy .
1508	0	a	The feel .
1509	0	a	Well
1510	0	a	So , if you ti
1511	0	a	Well You you
1512	1	a	Maybe you should have some some coloured titanium or something .
1513	0	a	And it it does not have to be strong , also .
1514	0	a	Nah
1515	0	a	yeah
1516	0	a	the feel
1517	0	a	Right .
1518	1	a	Only the feel .
1519	0	a	So it it looks pretty but it feels strong .
1520	0	a	Oh .
1521	0	a	I agree .
1522	0	a	And I Then I have some more findings .
1523	0	a	about the energy energy source of the of the device ,
1524	1	a	I suggest the basic battery .
1525	0	a	I got some other energy sources of course .
1526	0	a	But solar energy is not very practical inside a house , because you do not have a have a lot of sun .
1527	0	a	And kinetic and and and dynamos are are not very practical , I think , for for a simple remote , that is a bit ,
1528	0	a	oh , that is a bit That is a bit much .
1529	0	a	No titanium .
1530	1	a	And I also suggest as a shape a double curved case .
1531	0	a	the disadvantage of that that you can use no titanium .
1532	0	a	That that is the information I received .
1533	0	a	If you use the curved case , a curved case , double curved then you ca not use titanium .
1534	0	a	What do you exactly mean with double curved ?
1535	0	a	Double curved ?
1536	0	a	It it mean
1537	0	a	Yeah , well okay .
1538	0	a	Now this to give it a more modern look .
1539	0	a	And now the the shape , yeah , a curved case .
1540	0	a	yeah
1541	0	a	I think sort of triangle shaped bottom or something .
1542	0	a	a more modern look not plain , long box style , but
1543	1	a	I will draw it , but maybe later .
1544	0	a	I dunno .
1545	0	a	Yeah .
1546	0	a	Yeah .
1547	0	a	And it makes it gives it a more u user friendly shape , than if you have .
1548	0	a	anyway
1549	0	a	f as for the buttons , simple push buttons .
1550	1	a	No otherwi no difficult scroll things or some things like that ,
1551	0	a	because it makes more complex and expensive .
1552	0	a	And , as we agreed , we do not use a speaker or a sensor or speak speech controlled device .
1553	0	a	Yeah right .
1554	0	a	Because it makes it also more complex and expensive .
1555	0	a	But we do use an LCD screen , so we we do have to consider of we have to use a more advanced chip , which is more complex and expensive .
1556	0	a	But It is worth the trouble I think ,
1557	0	a	because
1558	0	a	rubber is a soft material , I guess .
1559	0	a	Well
1560	0	a	This soft material thing from Yeah .
1561	0	a	The buttons can be made of an a soft material .
1562	0	a	Because people like that .
1563	0	a	Yeah .
1564	0	a	soft enough .
1565	0	a	Yeah .
1566	0	a	Right .
1567	0	a	Right .
1568	0	a	Yeah .
1569	0	a	So that is basically what I want to talk about .
1570	0	a	Alright .
1571	0	a	Okay .
1572	0	a	We will take that .
1573	1	a	And then Mike ?
1574	0	a	Okay .
1575	0	a	Yeah .
1576	0	a	Well nah the method we will include the buttons as we discussed earlier .
1577	0	a	an LCD s screen will be implemented .
1578	0	a	we must decide where , this meeting .
1579	0	a	there are new developments in speech recognition systems , and they are already being used on coffee machines .
1580	0	a	And well they are cheap ,
1581	1	a	so we could use them now .
1582	0	a	Oh
1583	0	a	That is interesting .
1584	0	a	it is not really speech recognition , it is more like you can talk to the chip , record the message and record an answer ,
1585	0	a	and then once you talk to the remote , then he will a answer with the the prerecorded message that you left .
1586	0	a	So if I say hi Mike , and you have recorded hi
1587	0	a	Mike back , then you will get that .
1588	0	a	Oh , yeah , I understand .
1589	0	a	Oh okay .
1590	0	a	Yeah .
1591	0	a	Okay .
1592	0	a	Right .
1593	0	a	But you can also say that , when you say something , it does some function .
1594	0	a	No it does not does not do anything .
1595	0	a	No .
1596	0	a	Oh .
1597	0	a	But i it is just a
1598	0	a	Yeah it is it is cheap .
1599	0	a	That is a bit
1600	0	a	Yes .
1601	0	a	But that that makes it cheap .
1602	0	a	It is it is just a an extra function , and it is cheap .
1603	0	a	Yeah .
1604	0	a	I understand .
1605	0	a	But it has no functionality for our remote at all .
1606	0	a	No
1607	0	a	but
1608	0	a	Yeah , right .
1609	0	a	No
1610	0	a	but that is the gadget they want , or the gimmicks .
1611	0	a	But it it is n nice for young people .
1612	0	a	Young people love them .
1613	1	a	Yes , we we should really include that one , I think .
1614	0	a	They like gadgets .
1615	0	a	Yeah , ple
1616	0	a	Right .
1617	0	a	Yeah .
1618	0	a	If it is cheap .
1619	1	a	Well , as I said earlier I think the LCD screen should be positioned at the lower end of the remote .
1620	0	a	Yeah .
1621	1	a	the buttons for screen width and general settings and and that kind of stuff we can also do let that kind of functions be shown in the LCD screen , instead of extra buttons .
1622	0	a	So you put a menu in the LCD ?
1623	0	a	I think young people and yeah
1624	0	a	w well every user would like that .
1625	1	a	the buttons should be positioned positioned the same way as they are on a , well , conventional remote , I think .
1626	0	a	For the learnability and well to keep it recognisable .
1627	0	a	A voice recognition can be implemented .
1628	0	a	And I drew an example ,
1629	0	a	but it did not work quite the well the way I wanted it to do .
1630	0	a	Alright .
1631	1	a	Can you draw it now of
1632	1	a	Can you draw it now ?
1633	0	a	How How
1634	0	a	How do you give input to the menu on the LCD screen ?
1635	0	a	Alright .
1636	1	a	Well I have the
1637	1	a	I can draw it again ,
1638	0	a	and I know what I did wrong .
1639	0	a	I did not tick the note bo box in the .
1640	0	a	Alright .
1641	0	a	with the the up and down and and well buttons and the
1642	1	a	Well I will draw what I had drawn on the screen .
1643	0	a	So you have a menu button , and then you can go up and down .
1644	1	a	But then we should also have an an Okay button .
1645	0	a	Yeah right .
1646	0	a	Yes .
1647	1	a	I shall draw this .
1648	0	a	button , yeah .
1649	1	a	If it works .
1650	0	a	Just
1651	0	a	There is already a blank .
1652	0	a	Yes ?
1653	0	a	So Yeah .
1654	0	a	Yeah .
1655	0	a	so have I .
1656	0	a	Nah .
1657	1	a	You have to push hard .
1658	1	a	I suggest a banana shape .
1659	0	a	Because of the fruity fashion .
1660	0	a	Yeah .
1661	0	a	Yeah .
1662	0	a	No
1663	0	a	m
1664	0	a	Next year that is out .
1665	1	a	Yellow and
1666	0	a	Yeah alright , yeah .
1667	0	a	Just a hunch .
1668	0	a	Well these little buttons are a bit difficult to draw correct .
1669	0	a	Yeah .
1670	0	a	Those are the the cha the channel buttons of course ?
1671	0	a	And then below is the LCD screen ?
1672	0	a	Alright , yeah .
1673	0	a	Yeah just the numbers .
1674	0	a	These these will be bigger in the the real design .
1675	0	a	This must be the Okay button used to interact with the LCD screen .
1676	0	a	And with this you can , yes , go to through the menus
1677	0	a	and that can
1678	0	a	the video button should be an apart button , because you want it to t ,
1679	0	a	yeah ,
1680	0	a	to use it fast within one click .
1681	0	a	Yeah .
1682	0	a	You have
1683	0	a	Right .
1684	0	a	Yes .
1685	0	a	And what is the menu button ?
1686	0	a	But how did How do you get out of the menu then ?
1687	0	a	Yeah .
1688	1	a	And you you need a you need a speaker .
1689	0	a	it is
1690	1	a	This button can also be the Menu button , we use in the menus
1691	1	a	Well we we can add another button here , but
1692	0	a	Yeah .
1693	0	a	For the
1694	0	a	Yeah .
1695	1	a	Maybe I you could j just do an an exit with Okay .
1696	0	a	by pe pressing the menu button again .
1697	0	a	By pressing the menu button again , you go out .
1698	0	a	Yes , well but
1699	0	a	bec because when you push Menu you get in , and then you have to push
1700	0	a	Okay when you get to a choice .
1701	0	a	Yeah .
1702	0	a	It is usual the the the d kind of the way it works .
1703	0	a	Yeah ?
1704	0	a	Yeah ?
1705	0	a	Yeah .
1706	0	a	right .
1707	0	a	Well you you
1708	0	a	No no ,
1709	1	a	we we we should add a extra Menu button
1710	0	a	and this the Okay button .
1711	0	a	Well that is also the Okay button .
1712	0	a	But you can men you can press menu again to get out .
1713	0	a	That is you you should have
1714	1	a	Or you can put in the LCD is window an option Get Out .
1715	0	a	No .
1716	1	a	Exit .
1717	1	a	Exit .
1718	0	a	once you have an extra Menu button , you do not need that that extra option .
1719	0	a	Well , it is just a choice .
1720	0	a	You have redundancy .
1721	0	a	But we need a we need a a recording recording button for the speech part .
1722	0	a	Or do not
1723	0	a	Right ,
1724	1	a	and spea speaker at the back , or something .
1725	0	a	Yeah ,
1726	1	a	if we decide to to implement that , maybe we should .
1727	1	a	Why would you put it then , and where is the recording the microphone ?
1728	1	a	Where would you put it ?
1729	0	a	Uh huh .
1730	0	a	Well they that could be anywhere .
1731	0	a	That is very small .
1732	1	a	It could be down here .
1733	0	a	Well , not here .
1734	1	a	I
1735	1	a	yeah
1736	1	a	I suggest here .
1737	0	a	But that is just a little gap .
1738	0	a	Microphone , yeah .
1739	0	a	Yeah .
1740	0	a	Well the speaker and the microphone , I think , are the same little hole thingy .
1741	0	a	Yeah I understand .
1742	0	a	Yeah .
1743	1	a	but we could d do , but it is perhaps more expensive , the speaker on the back or something .
1744	0	a	Alright .
1745	0	a	Well i
1746	0	a	there are a all already being implemented in in coffee machines , so they wo not be very expensive .
1747	0	a	But This is my suggested design .
1748	0	a	Huh ?
1749	0	a	Yeah ?
1750	0	a	Okay .
1751	0	a	Alright .
1752	0	a	Alright .
1753	0	a	Well , okay , alright .
1754	0	a	Yes .
1755	1	a	then let is have a look at the decisions we are going to have to make .
1756	0	a	And oh I think as you can see so , the LCD screen does look better at the lower end , or at the bottom .
1757	0	a	I would I agree .
1758	0	a	Yeah , fine .
1759	0	a	But
1760	1	a	Oh , I had some examples .
1761	0	a	Fine .
1762	1	a	Move on .
1763	0	a	Well yeah
1764	0	a	yeah
1765	0	a	yeah .
1766	0	a	Yeah .
1767	0	a	I can live with it .
1768	0	a	You can
1769	0	a	But I did not like it very much , but Well these are quite obvious , very ugly remote .
1770	0	a	Yes ?
1771	0	a	Too big .
1772	0	a	Yeah .
1773	0	a	They do they do not look fruity enough .
1774	0	a	No , well th
1775	0	a	Yeah .
1776	0	a	Nei They are n they are not trendy .
1777	0	a	They are all black .
1778	0	a	Well not all .
1779	0	a	Hey , that one I like .
1780	0	a	this is for children but th
1781	0	a	No .
1782	0	a	Tho
1783	0	a	Yeah those
1784	0	a	But it does not the
1785	0	a	Yeah , ok Yeah .
1786	0	a	It does not look strong .
1787	0	a	No .
1788	0	a	W but with the colours
1789	0	a	i it is a bit the way we are going to .
1790	0	a	The remote .
1791	0	a	Yeah right .
1792	0	a	Well this is a terrible
1793	0	a	this looks
1794	0	a	Yeah .
1795	0	a	Terrible .
1796	0	a	This is just crazy .
1797	0	a	It is it is all too much buttons .
1798	1	a	But it it must not look too childish of course huh ?
1799	0	a	But it
1800	0	a	Yeah .
1801	0	a	Too many buttons .
1802	0	a	That is
1803	0	a	Well , that is too expensive I think .
1804	0	a	This these are the LCD screens .
1805	1	a	I think we should , if it is possible , one with colours , but
1806	0	a	I do not know
1807	0	a	Too expensive ?
1808	0	a	Alright .
1809	0	a	Nah th
1810	0	a	It is too expensive .
1811	0	a	Yeah .
1812	0	a	Well Nah .
1813	0	a	Alright .
1814	0	a	Yeah .
1815	0	a	Okay .
1816	0	a	Ha , even more .
1817	0	a	Huh .
1818	0	a	N
1819	0	a	Well
1820	0	a	Yeah , this is what we have just done .
1821	0	a	no .
1822	0	a	But are we going for a strange form ?
1823	0	a	Cause people like that .
1824	0	a	Kay .
1825	0	a	No , not very strange .
1826	0	a	Not not too strange .
1827	0	a	Not too strange .
1828	0	a	No .
1829	1	a	You can make the the underside , you can make it more round , where the LCD is .
1830	0	a	It still has t
1831	0	a	Yes .
1832	0	a	Th
1833	1	a	a a kind of bridge .
1834	1	a	So it f falls over the hand .
1835	1	a	I dunno if you know the No Nokia telephone , with the round thing at at the bottoms , s something like that .
1836	0	a	Yeah ?
1837	0	a	Yeah ?
1838	0	a	Yeah .
1839	1	a	You know ?
1840	0	a	Yeah ,
1841	0	a	but people like something new you know .
1842	0	a	Well I have at home a remote with a bridge .
1843	0	a	It is just a half round half half circle at
1844	0	a	And then it falls exactly over the hand ,
1845	0	a	and that is very nice .
1846	0	a	That is It feels comfortable .
1847	0	a	Exotic yeah .
1848	0	a	Yeah , different .
1849	0	a	We have t
1850	0	a	Yeah ,
1851	0	a	yeah .
1852	0	a	Yeah .
1853	1	a	I will design it , we design it later .
1854	0	a	Y yis
1855	0	a	Alright .
1856	0	a	So we will get to that later I guess .
1857	0	a	Great .
1858	0	a	Yeah , alright .
1859	0	a	where did I put it ?
1860	0	a	conceptual phase , I think this is it .
1861	0	a	The specific shape .
1862	0	a	The
1863	0	a	Our sources .
1864	0	a	I got this from our friends .
1865	0	a	So yeah the conceptual design .
1866	0	a	These are a few examples which we have to decide about .
1867	0	a	All the the materials from the case , the electric cable that is all your your side of the story .
1868	0	a	Yeah .
1869	0	a	Your bag .
1870	0	a	now from the user interface , your package ?
1871	0	a	where
1872	0	a	No well , that is more like the buttons where they have to come .
1873	0	a	And B a bit of , yeah well , a bit of design .
1874	0	a	But we should decide now .
1875	0	a	Yes ,
1876	0	a	but we have to decide about these now .
1877	0	a	Right ?
1878	0	a	right .
1879	0	a	Yeah .
1880	0	a	Materials are the most , most impor
1881	0	a	Yeah .
1882	0	a	And the trend watching .
1883	0	a	So as you said , fruity is in , well sells good .
1884	0	a	Wow .
1885	0	a	these things .
1886	0	a	So we have to put it in one document .
1887	0	a	yes .
1888	1	a	so if we go through them
1889	0	a	Yeah well
1890	0	a	Why should I
1891	0	a	Yeah .
1892	1	a	Copy paste this story into a into a Word document , and then put the answers after the subjects .
1893	0	a	Yeah .
1894	0	a	Not everything .
1895	0	a	Well we have to decide all these things ?
1896	1	a	W we can override them ?
1897	0	a	Well a case ?
1898	0	a	that is me .
1899	0	a	Yeah but all these examples are of a coffee machine .
1900	0	a	So
1901	0	a	What what kind of properties should it have ?
1902	0	a	Well we just listened .
1903	0	a	I suggest
1904	1	a	Well what do I suggest actually ?
1905	0	a	s solid ,
1906	0	a	yeah .
1907	0	a	I think we
1908	1	a	Why do not we use titanium or or a hard , yeah , some kind of metal for the the the whole remote except the front .
1909	0	a	Yeah .
1910	0	a	Do you know the new
1911	0	a	No no
1912	0	a	The front is the most important .
1913	0	a	That
1914	0	a	Just like most cell phones are .
1915	0	a	Yeah , I understand .
1916	0	a	Yeah .
1917	0	a	So we have titanium .
1918	1	a	Yeah but the non removable elements of the of the remote , so not the front , could be titanium ,
1919	0	a	to give that strong look .
1920	0	a	Yeah .
1921	0	a	You know what ?
1922	0	a	Alright .
1923	1	a	And then the front is made of plastic .
1924	0	a	And you can put that on and off , and switch it .
1925	0	a	Yeah .
1926	0	a	But the feel of plastic is not strong .
1927	0	a	No but you have titanium of course .
1928	0	a	No but you you have this
1929	0	a	Yeah .
1930	0	a	you have the best of both worlds .
1931	0	a	Yeah alright , alright .
1932	0	a	Kay .
1933	1	a	Yeah , you have the re remote in your hand like this .
1934	0	a	So you feel titanium .
1935	0	a	And of course , yeah , you have the the the plastic front end .
1936	0	a	But you also have the titanium .
1937	0	a	Yeah .
1938	0	a	Fronts are are cheaper than when they are from plas
1939	0	a	Yeah ,
1940	0	a	but it it is expensive .
1941	0	a	Yeah .
1942	0	a	Yeah of course ,
1943	0	a	but yeah you have to make a decision .
1944	0	a	And I do not know if you can make steel just any way you want it to .
1945	0	a	I guess so .
1946	0	a	titanium
1947	0	a	I sh
1948	0	a	I think
1949	0	a	Huh ?
1950	0	a	Well , well the
1951	0	a	According to my sources , it is it is totally possible to make an entire Titanium is available , and we can make an entire remote out of it , if we want .
1952	0	a	Yeah .
1953	0	a	Bendable .
1954	0	a	Bendable .
1955	0	a	Well any colour
1956	0	a	Yeah ,
1957	0	a	then you you paint it in the colour you want it .
1958	0	a	Yeah .
1959	0	a	The plastic is is the colour you want it .
1960	0	a	Paint spray .
1961	0	a	Yeah alright .
1962	0	a	So Yeah .
1963	0	a	So ,
1964	0	a	we are going for a titanium back and a plastic front ?
1965	0	a	Yeah , great .
1966	0	a	I have
1967	0	a	Titanium back , plastic front .
1968	0	a	Yeah , I think that is a nice trade off .
1969	0	a	Okay .
1970	0	a	well I am going to put it in here , because we can look .
1971	0	a	Yeah .
1972	0	a	I solid feel and trendy look .
1973	0	a	Alright .
1974	0	a	So material , hard plastic
1975	0	a	for the front ?
1976	0	a	Okay .
1977	0	a	Yeah , for the front and then titanium for the back .
1978	0	a	Yeah .
1979	0	a	For the non removable part .
1980	0	a	But then you have the problem , when you have a titanium back , you ca not switch it .
1981	0	a	When you want an other colour on the front , it does not match .
1982	0	a	Well but The titan titanium is not is not v very
1983	0	a	Yeah , i it does not curves .
1984	0	a	You know ?
1985	0	a	I understand .
1986	0	a	Well titanium is neutral .
1987	0	a	No I nei .
1988	0	a	Titanium is very
1989	0	a	No no no ,
1990	0	a	but you know b Titanium is very basic colour , and it does not really matter if we have a purple front on it or a orange front .
1991	0	a	Yeah ,
1992	0	a	yeah ,
1993	0	a	yeah .
1994	0	a	Yeah .
1995	0	a	Yeah .
1996	0	a	Alright .
1997	0	a	I dunno if if you disagree ,
1998	0	a	but I think it is does not matter very much .
1999	0	a	Well
2000	0	a	Our customers will use those funky trendy colours , and they do not use wood .
2001	0	a	Yeah .
2002	0	a	Alright .
2003	0	a	And even if it does does not match , it will People like colours that do not match .
2004	0	a	Funky customers .
2005	0	a	Yeah .
2006	0	a	Alright .
2007	0	a	And well
2008	0	a	the the electrical cable is just normal .
2009	0	a	Cop copper material .
2010	0	a	Yeah .
2011	0	a	Excuse me ?
2012	0	a	Yeah copper i just a ba basic
2013	0	a	Yeah in
2014	0	a	Yeah well inside the remote control we use a couple of
2015	0	a	Oh external ?
2016	0	a	Well A coffee grind does not have
2017	0	a	Na ja .
2018	0	a	The electrical cable does
2019	0	a	No we do not use an electrical cable .
2020	0	a	It is from our coffee
2021	0	a	Of course .
2022	0	a	Yeah inside , but this is for the coffee machine .
2023	0	a	Yeah ,
2024	0	a	but that is not what is meant here , I think .
2025	0	a	Nei .
2026	0	a	So external .
2027	0	a	Yeah .
2028	0	a	Yeah .
2029	0	a	Never mind the coffee grind .
2030	0	a	Well
2031	0	a	all the all the inside work of our remote is standard work .
2032	0	a	So
2033	0	a	The chip is normal silicon .
2034	0	a	Right ?
2035	0	a	Alright .
2036	0	a	the buttons are normal , etcetera .
2037	0	a	Okay ?
2038	0	a	So that is just easy .
2039	0	a	we decide about that just by looking at our competitors and our earlier remotes .
2040	0	a	The conceptual specification of the user interface ?
2041	0	a	well we have our beautiful drawing .
2042	0	a	Well I got a better one here
2043	0	a	and I will
2044	1	a	The shared folder .
2045	0	a	Alright .
2046	1	a	Well you can put that in into the shared folder ,
2047	1	a	and then I will put it in our end report .
2048	1	a	I will work this out for the next meeting .
2049	0	a	Yes ,
2050	0	a	you can
2051	1	a	yeah .
2052	1	a	You can put some which button is what .
2053	0	a	Yeah
2054	0	a	yeah
2055	0	a	yeah .
2056	0	a	Okay .
2057	0	a	the trend watching
2058	0	a	included these days .
2059	0	a	And what do we ?
2060	0	a	We thing that fruit and bright colours are
2061	0	a	Yes .
2062	0	a	Yeah the the the front w
2063	1	a	I think we can launch a couple of packages .
2064	1	a	You can buy a different kind of of of machine , but it is the same thing , but with another front .
2065	0	a	Yeah .
2066	0	a	So
2067	0	a	And you can you can
2068	0	a	Yeah right .
2069	1	a	We can also implement we can also implement fronts from movies that are very hot .
2070	0	a	Yeah
2071	0	a	that is the whole idea of the front .
2072	0	a	Yeah .
2073	0	a	Yeah .
2074	1	a	those kind of things .
2075	0	a	Yes .
2076	0	a	But that is for later on .
2077	0	a	The fronts y you can do anything with them .
2078	0	a	Yeah .
2079	1	a	Yeah
2080	1	a	but if you if you launch five different packages like iPod mini
2081	0	a	Yeah .
2082	0	a	Yeah , right
2083	0	a	For the initiative launch .
2084	0	a	For the for the launch , yeah .
2085	0	a	It is good marketing .
2086	0	a	Launch different lines at once .
2087	0	a	So e th then a c couple of basic colours .
2088	0	a	Not not very sim Not
2089	0	a	Yeah .
2090	0	a	Yeah ,
2091	1	a	n not too heavy .
2092	1	a	You can always take another pick .
2093	1	a	We should not give them the m the most lovely front when they buy it for the first time .
2094	1	a	They have to buy it later on .
2095	0	a	Oh yeah .
2096	0	a	Yeah .
2097	0	a	Yeah right .
2098	0	a	Yeah .
2099	0	a	Yeah .
2100	0	a	Come on .
2101	1	a	More basic .
2102	0	a	We still have to make those fifty million ,
2103	0	a	yeah ? .
2104	0	a	Yeah .
2105	0	a	Yeah .
2106	0	a	Very boring , yeah .
2107	1	a	Well you can you can give them s s three or so , so that they can experiment with it and that they want more .
2108	1	a	The most boring fronts possible .
2109	1	a	The most ugly .
2110	0	a	Yeah , right .
2111	1	a	Two .
2112	1	a	Yeah but you you can have some basic colours , and then we come with the special patterns on them ,
2113	0	a	and and
2114	0	a	And
2115	0	a	we still have to make We have still have to make the es the the real basic design .
2116	1	a	Red red , blue and green
2117	1	a	you give them or something , and then you can give them other ones .
2118	0	a	Yeah .
2119	0	a	Yeah .
2120	0	a	Yeah .
2121	0	a	Alright .
2122	0	a	well the buttons etcetera , we get from Mike .
2123	0	a	this fruit and bright colours ,
2124	1	a	yeah
2125	1	a	well I think we will have to in the next half an hour
2126	1	a	, we will have to s s specify the different types we want to launch , when we well introduce our remote .
2127	0	a	Because yeah we have the sketch but
2128	0	a	Alright , yeah .
2129	0	a	Yeah .
2130	0	a	But we we must remember that fancy look and feel is the most important thing .
2131	0	a	Yes .
2132	0	a	Else it w wo not sell .
2133	0	a	So
2134	0	a	Lost my mouse .
2135	0	a	Yes .
2136	0	a	Well I will have to ,
2137	0	a	before I get another warning for five minutes , I am going to get
2138	0	a	Where is my mouse ?
2139	0	a	where is my mouse ?
2140	0	a	Oh yeah .
2141	0	a	this is it .
2142	0	a	Unbelievable .
2143	0	a	Well , this we have .
2144	0	a	Yeah .
2145	0	a	basic stuff .
2146	0	a	Interface we have .
2147	0	a	Supplements , LCD .
2148	1	a	Maybe a a cheap voice recording .
2149	0	a	Well Yes .
2150	0	a	Yeah we should do that .
2151	0	a	The price ?
2152	0	a	We all agree on that .
2153	0	a	Alright .
2154	0	a	Individual actions .
2155	0	a	Yeah .
2156	0	a	Industry designer , .
2157	0	a	User Interface , Mike .
2158	0	a	You are going to work together on a prototype drawing on the SMARTboard .
2159	0	a	Yeah ,
2160	1	a	we can do that .
2161	0	a	Together or
2162	0	a	Yeah together .
2163	0	a	Yeah togeth
2164	1	a	You can take the SMARTboard .
2165	0	a	How Yeah yeah , but how do I
2166	1	a	Some Some non functional tasks .
2167	0	a	That is what I got to hear .
2168	1	a	But bu we stay we stay here or something ?
2169	0	a	right .
2170	0	a	Yes
2171	0	a	well we will get it to hear that I think .
2172	0	a	But I think so .
2173	0	a	Th they are saying SMARTboard and that is it
2174	0	a	This is the SMARTboard , so
2175	0	a	so you can you
2176	0	a	you are going to make a prototype , and y
2177	0	a	Well that is includes specifying the buttons etcetera .
2178	1	a	And take it to our rooms
2179	0	a	and
2180	0	a	specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach .
2181	0	a	Yeah .
2182	0	a	So you will get it on your em on your laptop .
2183	0	a	well you will go and do something else on the project
2184	0	a	yeah project evaluation .
2185	0	a	Have fun .
2186	0	a	So
2187	0	a	, what are you going to do ?
2188	0	a	I do not know what product evaluation exactly means , but you will get the specifications .
2189	0	a	Kay .
2190	0	a	We do not have produ product yet , so kind of difficult .
2191	0	a	Yeah .
2192	0	a	That is why I
2193	0	a	But
2194	0	a	How long do we still have ?
2195	0	a	Yeah .
2196	0	a	You are fired .
2197	0	a	No
2198	0	a	but
2199	1	a	Well , can we talk about something else ?
2200	0	a	no I do not know anything ,
2201	1	a	but maybe anyone else
2202	0	a	Yeah ?
2203	0	a	Round I think .
2204	1	a	Yeah .
2205	0	a	Ajax .
2206	0	a	Will we use round buttons or square ones for the for the numbers ?
2207	0	a	Yeah
2208	0	a	I
2209	0	a	I
2210	0	a	I also thought Yeah .
2211	0	a	Nah .
2212	0	a	round .
2213	0	a	Yeah .
2214	0	a	Round .
2215	0	a	To make it as as round as possible .
2216	1	a	And these these s these buttons are more triangle ish shaped with a square one in the middle .
2217	0	a	Why does
2218	0	a	f fuck you .
2219	0	a	Curvy .
2220	0	a	Yeah .
2221	0	a	So you can see you have to up or down .
2222	0	a	Yeah .
2223	0	a	Yeah .
2224	0	a	But now I see the
2225	0	a	Well th th th th th that depends .
2226	0	a	And this must be volume I think , and this programme .
2227	0	a	Heh ?
2228	0	a	We ca not get Ts
2229	0	a	It does not work any more .
2230	0	a	Well most of the time up and down is programme and left and right are volume , I think .
2231	0	a	Yeah .
2232	0	a	Yeah , it depends , but
2233	0	a	If you turn up the volume , you always see this thingy go up .
2234	0	a	Well we
2235	0	a	We
2236	0	a	we j we will just give them an
2237	1	a	We will design it ,
2238	1	a	and then they can give comments on it .
2239	0	a	Yeah , that is right .
2240	0	a	Yeah .
2241	0	a	Yeah alright .
2242	0	a	Yeah .
2243	0	a	Okay .
2244	0	a	We ca not save them .
2245	1	a	So we will just have them standing there .
2246	0	a	Yeah , I noticed .
2247	0	a	You ca not click the corners .
2248	0	a	No .
2249	0	a	It is a bit bit a pity .
2250	0	a	It is a real real great thing .
2251	0	a	Well we still have more than five minutes .
2252	0	a	So
2253	1	a	what are we going to do ?
2254	0	a	I as Project Manager ha do not have a clue .
2255	1	a	Let is start the design .
2256	1	a	Oh we can decide how we implement the feeling from our company into the remote .
2257	1	a	Well yeah .
2258	1	a	I think a logo , our company logo , and the slogan should be or could be
2259	0	a	Yeah , why not ?
2260	1	a	If there is enough space , you can put
2261	0	a	We will we will
2262	0	a	Well , our slogan is not very long .
2263	0	a	Also the slogan ?
2264	0	a	On the
2265	0	a	We put the fashion in electronics .
2266	0	a	I I would say only the logo .
2267	0	a	O
2268	0	a	Yeah .
2269	0	a	Me too .
2270	0	a	Too much text
2271	0	a	and it gets too too busy .
2272	0	a	It is just
2273	0	a	a simple
2274	0	a	What is it ?
2275	0	a	You c
2276	1	a	But you can put it on the back , on the titanium part .
2277	0	a	Well it is quite a long phrase .
2278	0	a	We put the fashion in electronics .
2279	0	a	But we kree we keep adjusting to the fashion with our fronts .
2280	0	a	So
2281	0	a	Yeah , right .
2282	1	a	The logo and the and the
2283	0	a	Yeah they do .
2284	1	a	the logo should be on the top I think .
2285	0	a	The logo
2286	0	a	Yeah .
2287	0	a	On the top .
2288	0	a	Yeah .
2289	1	a	Well in in in the right top corner ?
2290	0	a	And well you c
2291	1	a	On the back , you can put h At the bottom , you can put the logo with the
2292	0	a	Yeah .
2293	0	a	Well yeah .
2294	0	a	Right corner , yes .
2295	1	a	Right corner , or maybe here in the middle ?
2296	0	a	Yeah
2297	0	a	it it should be hard on the on the on the board , and you can remove the front .
2298	1	a	the text ?
2299	0	a	Yeah .
2300	0	a	But the logo the logo should not be exchangeable , when you get off the front .
2301	1	a	Just just small .
2302	0	a	yeah , at the back ?
2303	0	a	Well you
2304	0	a	c
2305	0	a	Well Yes .
2306	0	a	Yeah well
2307	1	a	Carved into the material .
2308	0	a	Yeah .
2309	0	a	You can
2310	1	a	The logo can be on on every front .
2311	0	a	Yeah .
2312	0	a	Yeah ,
2313	0	a	but you can scratch it off or something .
2314	0	a	It is better if you have it
2315	0	a	Yeah .
2316	0	a	Yeah , but then you must really yeah push it in or something .
2317	0	a	No ,
2318	1	a	you you can carve it into the titanium at the back .
2319	0	a	I
2320	0	a	l
2321	0	a	I like the idea of the of the slogan on the on the on the thing .
2322	0	a	But am I the only one , or
2323	0	a	No not on the front , but on the backside .
2324	0	a	Yeah , on the backside .
2325	0	a	Well , management would like it .
2326	0	a	Well n n not not on the front side , I think .
2327	0	a	The front side , no no l no slogan .
2328	0	a	On the back
2329	0	a	Yes , you you can , yeah , push that in , so that it is always be there .
2330	0	a	I think it is a nice idea , to make it more recognisable ,
2331	0	a	that the next to the logo you have the slogan .
2332	0	a	Sorry .
2333	0	a	Yeah .
2334	0	a	I agree .
2335	0	a	To make more of an impression .
2336	1	a	But not too big .
2337	0	a	Just
2338	0	a	Yeah .
2339	0	a	Not too big .
2340	0	a	No ,
2341	0	a	very small .
2342	0	a	Not on the entire back , but just very small .
2343	0	a	But readable enough of course .
2344	0	a	Okay .
2345	0	a	Yes , slogan from company on the back with logo and logo also on the front but not exchange ? ? when changing fronts .
2346	0	a	But we will we will take that with us into the design .
2347	1	a	Yeah I think over here the logo .
2348	0	a	Lo yeah .
2349	1	a	Or maybe here in the middle ,
2350	0	a	but we will decide later .
2351	0	a	Alright , that is decided .
2352	1	a	Do you do you see a bit of the of the of the titanium ?
2353	1	a	O on the front ?
2354	1	a	maybe if we make this this this lower part titanium ,
2355	0	a	the front is the the upper part , and the the bit with the with the LCD screen .
2356	0	a	Five minutes left .
2357	0	a	Yes
2358	0	a	we could
2359	0	a	No , they have two fronts ,
2360	0	a	that .
2361	0	a	So Yeah .
2362	0	a	So a bit of titanium between ?
2363	0	a	That is a bit Oh that that is that is pretty cool .
2364	0	a	Yeah .
2365	0	a	No no betwe
2366	0	a	of between
2367	0	a	we can do
2368	0	a	but
2369	0	a	But then you have two parts of front , two fronts that
2370	0	a	This enti entire bottom ?
2371	0	a	And then the lower part is titanium ?
2372	0	a	I think that is nice , yeah .
2373	0	a	No no no no .
2374	0	a	You have to make this titanium too .
2375	0	a	You you can
2376	0	a	Yeah .
2377	0	a	No ?
2378	0	a	Yes .
2379	0	a	Yeah .
2380	0	a	Else you you get problems with the LCD .
2381	0	a	Yeah .
2382	0	a	Yeah .
2383	0	a	Like dust in it and so things like that .
2384	0	a	Yeah .
2385	0	a	When you exchange all the fronts and it is open .
2386	0	a	I already have all kinds of filth between the mobile .
2387	1	a	No , you can you can just
2388	1	a	And then not a straight line but some sort of wave or something .
2389	0	a	This is titanium .
2390	1	a	Yeah .
2391	0	a	And this is
2392	0	a	F front .
2393	1	a	Some some kind of wei weight in it .
2394	1	a	Yeah .
2395	1	a	Yeah .
2396	1	a	Round forms .
2397	0	a	Yeah .
2398	0	a	I like that bit of titanium also on the
2399	0	a	A bit like a bit like your mobile phone .
2400	0	a	Yeah .
2401	0	a	Yeah .
2402	0	a	With the with the curved edge .
2403	0	a	Yep .
2404	1	a	Maybe you can show it .
2405	0	a	Yeah .
2406	0	a	It also has the those two distinct bit like this .
2407	0	a	Yeah .
2408	0	a	Tada .
2409	0	a	Yeah .
2410	0	a	Yeah .
2411	0	a	Yeah ,
2412	1	a	you can make it go round this corner too where the logo is .
2413	0	a	it is
2414	0	a	Yeah yeah .
2415	0	a	Because it has to be there all the time you know .
2416	0	a	What ?
2417	0	a	So round where ?
2418	0	a	Oh , yeah .
2419	0	a	That
2420	0	a	Yeah .
2421	0	a	So a little corner of titanium .
2422	0	a	Maybe a nice touch , yeah .
2423	0	a	Yeah ,
2424	0	a	that is nice finishing touch you need .
2425	0	a	Yes , that also sounds pretty neat .
2426	0	a	So this this is the exchangeable part .
2427	0	a	I think I am going to buy it .
2428	0	a	We want it .
2429	0	a	Yeah , this is the front .
2430	0	a	And it is only f twenty five Euros .
2431	0	a	Come on .
2432	0	a	My design .
2433	0	a	That is a bit too much , but No , no no no ,
2434	0	a	but I think this looks pretty nice actually .
2435	0	a	No that is nothing .
2436	0	a	The Phillips remote costs more .
2437	0	a	Of course , because it is my design
2438	0	a	but No our d our design , alright .
2439	0	a	Right .
2440	0	a	Taking all the credit .
2441	0	a	Well you two are going to work together .
2442	0	a	You will get your specifications on your laptop ,
2443	0	a	and then you
2444	0	a	Well I think we can ,
2445	0	a	I just
2446	0	a	It is
2447	0	a	Yeah , o Oh
2448	0	a	Oh , we have a one .
2449	0	a	Yeah .
2450	1	a	We will stay here I guess ?
2451	1	a	Well we can erase an animal I guess .
2452	0	a	But there is a problem .
2453	0	a	We ca not take a blank one .
2454	0	a	Or can we ?
2455	0	a	Yeah .
2456	1	a	the fourth one .
2457	0	a	Nah that is alright , that is alright .
2458	0	a	But do not erase my cat .
2459	0	a	the fourth one is empty , is not it ?
2460	0	a	Yeah .
2461	0	a	I want to preserve it .
2462	0	a	This one is empty .
2463	0	a	Yeah .
2464	1	a	You have to empty one huh ?
2465	0	a	Alright .
2466	0	a	What are you doing chief ?
2467	0	a	Yeah
2468	0	a	until the until the beep goes .
2469	0	a	So , you can draw a Yeah .
2470	0	a	Yeah I think we have to wait ?
2471	0	a	Maybe .
2472	0	a	Well I will get a
2473	0	a	I will get the message .
2474	0	a	No
2475	0	a	Yeah .
2476	0	a	But I do not Do we have to stay here ,
2477	1	a	or I think we have to return first .
2478	0	a	No , I think
2479	0	a	Well
2480	0	a	you will
2481	1	a	Maybe you can keep your laptop here .
2482	1	a	Or get your mouse .
2483	0	a	Because it is little bit hard to work with these plates .
2484	0	a	The high powers from above will have to tell us , yeah .
2485	0	a	Yeah .
2486	0	a	It is not relaxing .
2487	0	a	I always have a mouse next to my laptop .
2488	0	a	I hate these
2489	0	a	Ugh .
2490	0	a	I I do not have a laptop .
2491	0	a	Yeah , touch pads , yeah .
2492	1	a	We can do a touch pad on our remote .
2493	0	a	Yeah right .
2494	0	a	No just kidding .
2495	0	a	Yeah .
2496	0	a	Dream on .
2497	0	a	Well we have b you have to have a bit of humour in the in the discussions too , because it becomes too too too too stressy .
2498	0	a	And in your remote control .
2499	1	a	So we put a touch pad on it , and say ha ha .
2500	0	a	Aha .
2501	0	a	This has no function .
2502	0	a	Half
2503	0	a	No .
2504	0	a	Yeah .
2505	0	a	We know you will you will you will hate it but
2506	0	a	But they do want some gadgets .
2507	0	a	But th youth does not care about functio functionality , so
2508	0	a	Yeah .
2509	0	a	It is all about cool things .
2510	0	a	So that is wha what we are doing .
2511	0	a	And it will sell .
2512	0	a	We will be rich .
2513	0	a	Bless you .
2514	0	a	Well we wo not .
2515	0	a	Our bosses will be rich .
2516	0	a	We have done too much in the previous meetings .
2517	0	a	Too much ?
2518	0	a	Well they
2519	0	a	I think that is good .
2520	0	a	Yes ,
2521	0	a	we have got nothing to do now .
2522	0	a	Well , that is not bad , is it ?
2523	0	a	No .
2524	0	a	We all had our talk and we agree I guess on several thing , on most on things .
2525	0	a	Its the best remote ever .
2526	0	a	So
2527	0	a	Oh .
2528	0	a	Pinball .
2529	0	a	Oh he is totally off again .
2530	0	a	Well
2531	0	a	But when I start here , it is here .
2532	0	a	No man .
2533	1	a	You just have to push harder .
2534	1	a	Yeah you have to push harder .
2535	0	a	So is it
2536	0	a	Nope .
2537	0	a	Yeah .
2538	0	a	Yes ,
2539	0	a	but you
2540	0	a	you get really close to the screen with your hand ,
2541	0	a	and I do not think that is
2542	1	a	Recalibrate it .
2543	1	a	Where is the good old chalk board with the the green board with the , how do you call it , chalk , yeah .
2544	0	a	Yeah .
2545	0	a	We can better draw a design on this .
2546	0	a	Yeah , maybe .
2547	0	a	Yeah , but we ca not .
2548	0	a	Maybe if i if that thing is recalibrated , we can draw a thing quick , and then before it goes off again .
2549	0	a	Yeah .
2550	1	a	Let is go .
2551	0	a	Well
2552	1	a	We will stay here ?

2572	0	a	and then we will get an email .
2573	0	a	Yeah .
2574	0	a	That is a good idea .
2575	0	a	Alright .
2576	0	a	Well

2578	0	a	fourth meeting .
2579	0	a	We have to do what ?

2587	0	a	Very interesting .
2588	0	a	Well you will you two will present us your prototype .
2589	0	a	Yeah .
2590	1	a	Then I guess that is your bit ?
2591	0	a	I
2592	0	a	I did not s see anything about it ,
2593	0	a	so I already thought you you were to do that .
2594	0	a	Yeah .
2595	0	a	So the you are .
2596	0	a	I will show you how we are going to do with financing this design .
2597	0	a	Yeah , that is important too .
2598	0	a	Yeah .
2599	0	a	And then we will evaluate , after after we have redesigned it .
2600	0	a	Bit late .
2601	0	a	Because well we will see about the costs .
2602	0	a	we will evaluate our p our production and then we can close .
2603	0	a	Alright .
2604	0	a	Well the finance we will do later ,
2605	1	a	so firstly I will show you the notes .
2606	0	a	I do not think it is very interesting .
2607	0	a	I think it is .
2608	0	a	Oh nei .
2609	0	a	no .
2610	0	a	Alright .
2611	0	a	This is copy paste .
2612	0	a	So
2613	0	a	Of course .
2614	0	a	From me of course
2615	0	a	, yeah .
2616	0	a	You had some very strange layout .
2617	0	a	Well from us all , yeah , from all of us .
2618	0	a	Yeah .
2619	0	a	It is a nice chorus , yeah .
2620	0	a	Well
2621	0	a	We ge we went through the agenda , and well we had some some presentations from you three .
2622	0	a	And I summarised what you said to us .
2623	0	a	So I do not think it is very interesting and go through it again .
2624	0	a	Repeat it
2625	0	a	yeah .
2626	0	a	So
2627	0	a	This is what we decided .
2628	0	a	Alright .
2629	0	a	It is also copy paste from what we made together .
2630	0	a	So we still know that .
2631	0	a	Okay .
2632	1	a	And then we can we can use the time better .
2633	0	a	Well next you two will present the pot prototype for us .
2634	1	a	Alright , we both will ?
2635	1	a	Or one of us will ?
2636	0	a	Alright .
2637	0	a	Yeah .

2642	0	a	you will
2643	0	a	Right .
2644	0	a	Yeah .
2645	0	a	Correct .
2646	0	a	well
2647	0	a	this is our design .
2648	0	a	it is pretty much like Mike draw drew the in the during the last meeting .
2649	0	a	With the different perspectives of it .
2650	0	a	we will begin with the front .
2651	0	a	We have of course the the round shape the round basic shape .
2652	0	a	with the upper part being the front .
2653	0	a	Th
2654	0	a	So there is this part which is made of hard plastic , the front .
2655	0	a	And we are we are using different colours .
2656	0	a	Of course for the launch we use the basic ugly colours , and later we will put out more interesting covers with different patterns and pictures and everything .
2657	0	a	Yeah .
2658	0	a	But basically , different colours , bright colours not black , too dark .
2659	0	a	Fancy colours .
2660	0	a	then we have the lower part of the of the device .
2661	0	a	which is of course part of the back actually , because it is also titanium .
2662	0	a	You can see it also on the on the on the side view , that only this part is the front , and the rest of it , the under the under side of it , yeah , the back side and the lower part of the front is of course titanium made of titanium , and has the titanium colour of course , the look .
2663	0	a	then we have on back on the front the logo in the upper corner , which is made which is also part of the back , part of the titanium titanium part .
2664	0	a	Yeah , it is a double R , but It is a double R .
2665	0	a	Yeah ?
2666	0	a	It is a double R .
2667	0	a	Yeah the logo it is difficult to draw so small ,
2668	0	a	but it is our double R logo is in there .
2669	0	a	But it is very difficult to to draw that in
2670	0	a	Yeah .
2671	0	a	Yeah , alright .
2672	0	a	Okay .
2673	0	a	Yeah .
2674	0	a	so that is the logo in the upper lef right corner .
2675	0	a	Then we have the buttons .
2676	0	a	it is difficult to draw again the little oval or round
2677	1	a	I think oval will be better for the for the d for the different channel buttons .
2678	0	a	Oval
2679	0	a	yeah .
2680	0	a	Alright .
2681	0	a	So oval , n those are here .
2682	0	a	And then we have the m The m
2683	0	a	Yeah
2684	0	a	the the con the the the , yeah , the t volume and the channel controls in the middle here .
2685	1	a	Channel up and volume ?
2686	0	a	Yeah .
2687	0	a	with kind of arrow shapes ,
2688	0	a	which makes it also a bit more exciting than basic round or square buttons .
2689	0	a	And also here are the two buttons we agreed on .
2690	0	a	We have the Okay button .
2691	0	a	Oh nei
2692	0	a	we the Okay button is here in the middle of the of the operators , of the channel and volume changers .
2693	0	a	And then we have here the Menu button
2694	0	a	and the
2695	0	a	And the video button .
2696	0	a	Alright .
2697	0	a	Menu for the LCD screen .
2698	0	a	The
2699	0	a	Yeah .
2700	0	a	right .
2701	0	a	So Kay .
2702	0	a	And of course this low part , this is the LCD screen .
2703	0	a	this is what we made of it .
2704	1	a	You can make suggestions if you want .
2705	1	a	Well if I look at it , the side the side view
2706	0	a	Oh yeah alright .
2707	0	a	Well , at the back
2708	0	a	Yeah .
2709	1	a	Maybe we maybe we should finish first our talk and then you can add suggestions .
2710	0	a	Maybe I
2711	0	a	I do not want to
2712	0	a	I do not want to suppress you
2713	0	a	but n I will finish this quick .
2714	0	a	Yeah .
2715	0	a	okay I have had everything I guess on the front ?
2716	0	a	Yeah the back .
2717	0	a	No the back .
2718	0	a	With the logo and our l
2719	0	a	No I do not think
2720	0	a	And the
2721	0	a	And about the side view This the front wo not be as thick , but again th the the drawing technique makes it very difficult to to really
2722	0	a	Well , it wo not be visible .
2723	0	a	Yeah .
2724	0	a	We thought about
2725	0	a	Yeah , the back is of course totally titanium .
2726	0	a	And we thought about the logo big in the middle .
2727	0	a	Just so again the double R .
2728	0	a	We have then the logo on front and on the back .
2729	0	a	Maybe that is too much
2730	0	a	but you have to say say that if you think that way .
2731	0	a	Okay .
2732	0	a	And the company slogan , we thought in a kind of arc shape above the logo .
2733	0	a	Yeah .
2734	0	a	Yeah .
2735	0	a	That is basically what we were thinking about ,
2736	0	a	and
2737	0	a	Oh and before I forget .
2738	0	a	Okay .
2739	0	a	W
2740	0	a	Well I see , but
2741	0	a	Well .
2742	0	a	Yeah the the voice , of course , the voice recorder is at the bottom .
2743	0	a	Yeah I see it .
2744	0	a	Yes .
2745	0	a	And you can record it using , yeah , the the the back of the f w device .
2746	0	a	When I look at when I look at this side view , I think w when I have that in my hand
2747	0	a	, it is terrible .
2748	0	a	Yeah .
2749	0	a	If if you look if if this this is thick , and this is thin , th th then it that it lies over your hands .
2750	0	a	Why ?
2751	0	a	Well it fits it it
2752	0	a	it
2753	0	a	it fits the hand ,
2754	0	a	mean the the the the
2755	0	a	In the middle in the
2756	0	a	That is the question .
2757	0	a	But Well what what what
2758	0	a	I what I agree is that when when you have such of an arc in the middle , so that the the a the ends and the fronts is a bit thicker , so th then it falls over your hands .
2759	0	a	Yeah , I agree .
2760	0	a	If y
2761	0	a	If you handle a remote , you you usually do not have your hand straight like this .
2762	0	a	You you have it a bit
2763	0	a	Yeah .
2764	0	a	It depends on the size .
2765	0	a	If it is kind of small , this is is great .
2766	0	a	But if it is it is larger , then you want to grab it .
2767	0	a	And how large is it ?
2768	0	a	Well
2769	0	a	Well the sides I have not seen yet , ?
2770	0	a	They the the the the the side view ,
2771	0	a	we did not
2772	0	a	Yeah .
2773	0	a	Yeah .
2774	0	a	Yeah , that is the question .
2775	0	a	well Yeah .
2776	1	a	H
2777	1	a	What do you suggest
2778	1	a	I mean we do ?
2779	0	a	This was Mike is prototype , and
2780	0	a	y you seemed to agreed on it .
2781	0	a	But now you have a totally different .
2782	0	a	Well , they lay there all the time .
2783	0	a	The size ?
2784	0	a	Yeah well the size does not really matter
2785	0	a	w
2786	0	a	I mean
2787	0	a	Side ?
2788	0	a	oh the side ?
2789	0	a	W
2790	0	a	we we
2791	0	a	he drew the s the side , but you d you were not paying attention as usual .
2792	0	a	Yeah yeah .
2793	0	a	Well any case , we will discuss it now .
2794	0	a	I think this is a pretty good good idea .
2795	0	a	Yeah , I agree with the LCD screen .
2796	0	a	You have it in your palm like this , and you can watch watch the screen .
2797	1	a	And if you have it li in the middle , your hand might be over it .
2798	0	a	But you you hold it like this .
2799	0	a	Yeah
2800	0	a	you you do not you do not grab it ,
2801	0	a	you you
2802	0	a	Yeah .
2803	0	a	You are not holding it like this or something .
2804	0	a	You , yeah ,
2805	0	a	y
2806	0	a	How do you call it ?
2807	0	a	Yeah .
2808	0	a	Well y y y
2809	0	a	you do not have it like this .
2810	0	a	You have it more like this .
2811	0	a	No no no .
2812	0	a	You you you are using buttons this way , or if you are right handed , this way .
2813	0	a	Like you are holding your telephone .
2814	0	a	Yep .
2815	0	a	So you
2816	0	a	Yeah .
2817	0	a	Because if you have a screen on it , you want to look at your screen .
2818	0	a	So
2819	0	a	Yeah well
2820	1	a	And maybe you can you can grab it a bit higher ,
2821	0	a	so Well
2822	0	a	Well the the Well that is a reason to to to put the LCD screen of course on the upper side , but If necessary .
2823	0	a	That way , it it falls into your hand .
2824	0	a	I think .
2825	0	a	Okay .
2826	0	a	Yeah , I agree on this .
2827	0	a	No , I do not think so .
2828	0	a	That is not the point
2829	1	a	And you might be You might be target customer .
2830	0	a	No
2831	0	a	but but
2832	0	a	Well f for as far as I can see , three of us agree and only Nils
2833	0	a	But you are the Project Manager , you can make the hard decisions .
2834	0	a	Yeah well
2835	0	a	I think if you t if you three agree then then that is it .
2836	0	a	Yes .
2837	0	a	So I c
2838	0	a	I c
2839	0	a	Well , we will we we will do it like this .
2840	0	a	But are d Can you live with it ?
2841	0	a	Y Yeah ,
2842	0	a	y y
2843	0	a	y
2844	0	a	y
2845	0	a	you said it was totally unusable .
2846	0	a	Yeah ?
2847	0	a	Alright , if you think that that is the way
2848	0	a	it should
2849	0	a	No No ,
2850	0	a	when I I my personal taste is that I want it to fall over my hands with a thick
2851	0	a	But In the market
2852	0	a	No not totally .
2853	0	a	But do you
2854	0	a	But d you do not think this is completely unusable I guess .
2855	0	a	I think .
2856	0	a	Not totally , well
2857	0	a	Yeah
2858	0	a	but of course
2859	0	a	y you are also human .
2860	0	a	For me , I I would not buy it .
2861	0	a	Let is say it like that .
2862	0	a	We have to take every everyone into account .
2863	0	a	No
2864	0	a	Yes
2865	0	a	but
2866	0	a	Yeah , we do not know ,
2867	1	a	but that is that is that is that is more market research .
2868	0	a	So
2869	0	a	Yeah .
2870	1	a	Well who who else thinks like you ?
2871	0	a	We do not know .
2872	1	a	Maybe a thousand people , or a million people .
2873	1	a	So let it be like this at at this moment .
2874	0	a	Let it be .
2875	0	a	Alright .
2876	0	a	Okay ?
2877	0	a	No , I think it is great .
2878	0	a	So that is that .
2879	1	a	any other suggestions ?
2880	0	a	You are very personal again .
2881	0	a	Yeah .
2882	0	a	But what about the redesigning ?
2883	0	a	Okay .
2884	0	a	Comes to that later .
2885	0	a	you .
2886	0	a	c You can Walter .
2887	0	a	You can do the evaluation criteria on this ?
2888	0	a	That is more useful than just speaking .
2889	0	a	Alright .
2890	0	a	Great .
2891	0	a	Well , this is just a short intro .
2892	0	a	I am going to do the ev evaluation .
2893	0	a	Yes .
2894	0	a	That is going to be done at the end of seven point skill criteria .
2895	0	a	So I made a I made a few questions on the hand of the impor most important requirements and trends .
2896	0	a	And we have to look if our if our device is working correctly .
2897	0	a	Well , I put some questions in a Word file .
2898	1	a	See if I can find them .
2899	0	a	Kay .
2900	0	a	Well
2901	0	a	I think you have all seen this kind of evaluation , so I do not have to explain it .
2902	0	a	the first question is , is the device good looking ?
2903	0	a	Because normal p most people thought that earlier devices were ugly ugly .
2904	0	a	Seventy five percent of them .
2905	0	a	So what do we think ?
2906	0	a	Yeah
2907	0	a	No , I know ,
2908	0	a	but I have to evaluate it .
2909	0	a	Well d we designed it ,
2910	0	a	so of course we are very
2911	0	a	Yeah .
2912	0	a	Yeah , we are we are not quite objective about this .
2913	0	a	Well we designed it to be good looking .
2914	0	a	So I have to take this questionnaire .
2915	0	a	So and we ha we have answer now ?
2916	0	a	Yeah .
2917	1	a	To the customers ?
2918	1	a	To potential customers who have to take this questionnaire ?
2919	0	a	Nei .
2920	0	a	Yeah
2921	0	a	Yeah ,
2922	0	a	but I ca not can s
2923	0	a	Yeah ,
2924	0	a	but , you know We dis we di
2925	0	a	we designed it to be perfect .
2926	0	a	Oh no .
2927	0	a	I know , I know , I know .
2928	0	a	But Well we can go , because of the time , pretty quick through this .
2929	0	a	do we find it good looking ?
2930	0	a	Well we think so .
2931	0	a	I
2932	0	a	Yeah , I think it
2933	1	a	Well l well let is start with the beginning , just one by one .
2934	0	a	Yeah .
2935	0	a	Yeah .
2936	0	a	We designed it to be good looking , so
2937	0	a	So But we have to be critic critical about it .
2938	0	a	And I have to take all these points and get a average at the end .
2939	0	a	So we we know where we stand .
2940	0	a	Well , one .
2941	0	a	Cause th there are some things we might have bi might have forgotten .
2942	0	a	Well so it is point four .
2943	0	a	Right , so Right .
2944	0	a	Easy to find t
2945	1	a	Two .
2946	0	a	is it good looking ?
2947	1	a	The titanium might be f for older people .
2948	0	a	Well , I guess I think it is
2949	0	a	it is it is pointed towards the youth of course , if you look at the design and and the colours and everything .
2950	0	a	That was our target audience of course .
2951	0	a	But it is also not completely u unacceptable for older people I guess .
2952	0	a	it is it is not f a device that
2953	0	a	Yeah , that is that is for older people ,
2954	0	a	it is it is more that classical look .
2955	1	a	It you put put a black front on it or something .
2956	0	a	So
2957	0	a	no .
2958	0	a	I think
2959	0	a	Yeah they like black of course , but I think they will they
2960	0	a	they think the the titanium look of it is also
2961	0	a	I think it is also good for them ,
2962	0	a	so I think we both have consider considered the youth and also a bit older people .
2963	0	a	So I think it is very good looking and not only for youth young people .
2964	0	a	Right .
2965	1	a	I think we should not discuss any points points that long ,
2966	0	a	because I do not know how how many points there are but
2967	0	a	Right .
2968	0	a	No .
2969	0	a	I totally agree .
2970	0	a	Yeah , the fourteen yeah .
2971	0	a	We we have to get get on , go through this .
2972	0	a	Right , a number please .
2973	0	a	Yeah .
2974	0	a	Is it easy to t change channels ?
2975	0	a	Yeah well I think so .
2976	0	a	So the last one is seven .
2977	0	a	Easy to change channels ?
2978	0	a	Oh , sorry .
2979	0	a	, no it is
2980	1	a	With two huge buttons .
2981	0	a	No , not false .
2982	0	a	It is one .
2983	0	a	Yeah , right .
2984	0	a	Well two ?
2985	1	a	Y
2986	1	a	Well we have to go through it .
2987	0	a	Change channels ?
2988	0	a	Right .
2989	0	a	I think it is as easy as can be made .
2990	0	a	So I
2991	0	a	Yeah .
2992	1	a	You How can you make it any easier ?
2993	0	a	Yeah , huge is a Yeah .
2994	0	a	The power , channel and volume buttons are easy accessible ?
2995	0	a	Two ?
2996	0	a	Alright .
2997	0	a	Yep .
2998	0	a	Two .
2999	0	a	The device is easy to find if you lose it ?
3000	0	a	Yeah .
3001	0	a	Well , no .
3002	0	a	D we d we do not we do not have that s
3003	0	a	Yeah .
3004	0	a	We did not implement anything about that .
3005	0	a	Well it is easier to find than a a normal black one or something , because of the colour .
3006	0	a	But We have so few functions ,
3007	0	a	so Yeah .
3008	1	a	Well six then .
3009	0	a	Six ?
3010	0	a	Right .
3011	0	a	Well we do not have the device that beeps when you lost it or so ,
3012	0	a	but
3013	0	a	Yeah .
3014	0	a	Are the functions easy to learn ?
3015	0	a	Well w I we do want we have a l f f less of an
3016	0	a	And the device RSI sensitive ?
3017	0	a	Yeah .
3018	0	a	Yeah , I agree .
3019	0	a	Well , I should I think two ,
3020	0	a	because the voice recorder is n not self learning .
3021	0	a	Yeah .
3022	0	a	Yeah .
3023	0	a	Alright .
3024	0	a	Are we take too much time ?
3025	0	a	Yeah , very much .
3026	0	a	Two ?
3027	0	a	Yeah
3028	0	a	Yeah , I agree .
3029	0	a	Yeah , but just do some We we
3030	0	a	I th
3031	0	a	I th
3032	0	a	I think this is too time consuming .
3033	0	a	not not towards you , but towards this all .
3034	0	a	No .
3035	0	a	Th this is
3036	0	a	We you have to put it to the customers .
3037	0	a	Yeah .
3038	0	a	Right ,
3039	0	a	R RSI sensitive ?
3040	0	a	RSI sensitive ?
3041	0	a	Four .
3042	0	a	well well a bit , so four .
3043	0	a	Yeah .
3044	0	a	Yes .
3045	0	a	One .
3046	0	a	One .
3047	0	a	And features included also one .
3048	0	a	And One .
3049	0	a	those nine is the fancy looking .
3050	0	a	we still think so .
3051	0	a	Yeah .
3052	0	a	Device fancy feeling .
3053	0	a	And I think fancy feeling too ,
3054	0	a	because of the titanium back .
3055	0	a	Yeah , cool man .
3056	0	a	Yeah .
3057	0	a	Yeah .
3058	0	a	Right .
3059	0	a	Are there enough technology ?
3060	0	a	Yeah well also we have two .
3061	0	a	Yeah .
3062	0	a	Yeah , that is great .
3063	0	a	Is the device easy to use ?
3064	0	a	Yes
3065	0	a	we have not many buttons .
3066	0	a	The
3067	0	a	Two two .
3068	1	a	So well maybe two
3069	0	a	because of the voice recorder .
3070	0	a	Well , with the
3071	0	a	Three .
3072	0	a	Two , three .
3073	0	a	T
3074	0	a	Yeah .
3075	0	a	Are the trends about fruit and vegetables implemented ?
3076	0	a	Well in our covers , in our fronts .
3077	0	a	F
3078	0	a	Yeah .
3079	0	a	So yes , one .
3080	0	a	One or two .
3081	0	a	Oh okay .
3082	0	a	One or two , another two .
3083	0	a	Yeah .
3084	0	a	Nah f four I think .
3085	0	a	Four ?
3086	0	a	Well , it does not really resemble any fruit , that is true .
3087	1	a	If you look at this
3088	0	a	No .
3089	0	a	But but we have the the the the the sparkly fruity colours of course .
3090	0	a	Well three .
3091	0	a	Three , alright .
3092	0	a	Okay .
3093	0	a	And you can also have front with with fruit on it .
3094	0	a	Yeah , that is true .
3095	0	a	Is the material attractive ?
3096	0	a	Well the titanium is strong , and the rest f the buttons feel soft .
3097	0	a	But
3098	0	a	Right .
3099	0	a	Yeah .
3100	0	a	So I would say at least two .
3101	0	a	Okay .
3102	0	a	Well Yeah .
3103	0	a	This is the last meeting ?
3104	0	a	Yeah .
3105	0	a	Yes , but we we have to design much more , because there was some irritating account manager coming to me .
3106	0	a	The average will come later .
3107	0	a	I knew things were going too smoothly .
3108	0	a	Oh .
3109	0	a	There had to be some kind of trouble along the way .
3110	0	a	Yes .
3111	0	a	Yeah .
3112	0	a	Well ,
3113	1	a	look at the costs at this point .
3114	0	a	My god .
3115	0	a	I had to fit it in .
3116	0	a	It has to go to twelve , right ?
3117	0	a	Twelve and a half .
3118	0	a	I twelve and a half .
3119	0	a	So
3120	0	a	Well what costs a lot ?
3121	0	a	The sample spea costs four .
3122	0	a	The what ?
3123	0	a	The
3124	0	a	Yeah w tha that is that is a bit an optional option .
3125	0	a	The sample speaker , the s sensor .
3126	1	a	Out .
3127	0	a	That is easy .
3128	0	a	Kick it out .
3129	1	a	Kick it out .
3130	0	a	The what ?
3131	0	a	Oh .
3132	0	a	Yeah .
3133	0	a	We have to go to twelve and a half .
3134	0	a	The speaker .
3135	0	a	The speaker costs far , by far the most .
3136	0	a	That is some wrong info , man .
3137	0	a	It it is not worth it .
3138	0	a	No .
3139	0	a	No .
3140	0	a	No , d th No .
3141	1	a	We could make two different versions , one with and one without .
3142	0	a	It is
3143	0	a	It is just extra .
3144	0	a	But for this
3145	0	a	So , zero .
3146	1	a	Kick it out .
3147	0	a	Yeah .
3148	0	a	Then we go to fourteen point six .
3149	1	a	What more ?
3150	1	a	Batteries are quite
3151	0	a	no , no no no .
3152	0	a	Well the titanium I do not want to lose actually .
3153	0	a	No .
3154	0	a	LC three ?
3155	0	a	Yeah hand dynamo ?
3156	0	a	Y t come on ,
3157	0	a	w a remote control has a battery .
3158	0	a	Well well why why why should we use a advanced chip ?
3159	0	a	Yeah ?
3160	0	a	Ca not we do that with a regular chip ?
3161	0	a	Why not ?
3162	0	a	Yeah .
3163	0	a	N
3164	0	a	well we have a bit of a problem I think .
3165	0	a	Because
3166	0	a	the LCD screen .
3167	0	a	Well be for the LCD you had said .
3168	0	a	Yeah .
3169	0	a	No .
3170	0	a	Because that y
3171	0	a	because my information says it .
3172	0	a	Well what what is the difference between simple and regular ?
3173	0	a	What is the difference between a simple and a regular chip ?
3174	0	a	And simple ?
3175	0	a	Nothing .
3176	0	a	Huh ?
3177	0	a	well yeah
3178	0	a	I
3179	0	a	I read something about it , but
3180	0	a	Yeah ,
3181	0	a	I
3182	0	a	I read something about it ,
3183	0	a	but it was not very clear .
3184	0	a	Regular is normal .
3185	0	a	Yeah .
3186	0	a	Simple .
3187	0	a	Elementary .
3188	1	a	Well ?
3189	0	a	Your part .
3190	0	a	I d I did not in include it in my report .
3191	1	a	What happens if we do
3192	0	a	How much do we win ?
3193	0	a	One .
3194	0	a	Single
3195	0	a	Well you have to use a chip .
3196	0	a	So Well you have to use the advanced chip , if you have the LCD screen .
3197	0	a	We we we
3198	0	a	Why ?
3199	0	a	We have very little options furthermore ,
3200	0	a	for the
3201	0	a	well we have to put that in .
3202	0	a	But if you have a regular chip , you ca not have the LCD screen .
3203	0	a	Yeah .
3204	0	a	Yeah , we need to have the the LCD screen .
3205	0	a	That that is a fact .
3206	1	a	Well , we could say , well this special colour , that is not that that is not there ,
3207	0	a	because the the fronts they will buy it .
3208	0	a	Yeah , but it is only one half .
3209	0	a	No
3210	0	a	Yeah ,
3211	0	a	but No , that is
3212	0	a	n It is not relevant .
3213	0	a	The special colour .
3214	0	a	Nah .
3215	0	a	it
3216	0	a	d it does not
3217	0	a	But we d Then we have to lose the LCD screen .
3218	0	a	Yeah ,
3219	0	a	then you s then you only have one half left .
3220	0	a	Yeah , you must change the chip back .
3221	0	a	You must change the chip back , Nils .
3222	0	a	Yeah .
3223	0	a	yeah .
3224	0	a	No , Then the whole concept is
3225	0	a	You
3226	1	a	You can make you can make it cheaper .
3227	0	a	Yeah , I know
3228	0	a	but that is what my information says .
3229	0	a	I di
3230	0	a	I did not put the advanced chip in there for fun .
3231	0	a	No we
3232	0	a	oh
3233	0	a	You you we have an advanced chip on print , and we have an LC display .
3234	0	a	You have to use it .
3235	0	a	But if you do not sell
3236	0	a	No
3237	0	a	no no no .
3238	0	a	Yeah .
3239	0	a	I think that is a bit double .
3240	0	a	Yeah ?
3241	0	a	No ,
3242	0	a	the advanced chip is needed to have an LCD display .
3243	0	a	Y we do not need both .
3244	0	a	For the LCD screen .
3245	0	a	Yeah .
3246	0	a	Yeah .
3247	0	a	Says .
3248	0	a	Says , his that was in the second meeting , I think .
3249	0	a	Well and what do they mean with curves again ?
3250	0	a	Because we you have uncurved
3251	0	a	Yeah .
3252	0	a	Well I I did single curve to
3253	0	a	Well you said s double curved ,
3254	0	a	he ,
3255	0	a	because I thought it is a b a bit cheaper already .
3256	0	a	I ?
3257	0	a	One curve .
3258	1	a	We can also make it flat .
3259	0	a	Well But what what did what do
3260	0	a	n
3261	0	a	Sorry ,
3262	0	a	but What do they mean with the curves ?
3263	0	a	Is th Is this a curve ?
3264	0	a	One curve ?
3265	0	a	Yeah , this is actually two curves , yeah .
3266	0	a	But
3267	0	a	Curved ?
3268	0	a	Yes , that is curved .
3269	0	a	Yes .
3270	0	a	It is how you It is how you look at it .
3271	0	a	No , it is one curve .
3272	0	a	One curve , simple .
3273	0	a	Well then we have a huge problem I think .
3274	0	a	W t we can never get below the twelve and a half .
3275	0	a	We have a big financial problem .
3276	1	a	Well we make it more expensive to buy .
3277	0	a	Well , then we have two dollars less profit .
3278	0	a	Come on ,
3279	0	a	if we if we if we make this fifty million , they wo not hesitate to congratulate us , so By the way , we also have this one .
3280	0	a	If if you make people brand aware , they are willing to pay more .
3281	0	a	But Because we we use a brand at the front and I dun at the back .
3282	0	a	But I
3283	0	a	Hey but I think you will agree that that we that now we have this screen , it is it is very not practical to ha to consider this after we have designed the entire thing .
3284	0	a	If you have lots of marketing people might buy .
3285	0	a	Yeah or we could replace it
3286	1	a	Why why do not we replace the titanium with plastic coloured titanium , titanium coloured plastic ?
3287	0	a	Yeah well if we we we have to get cheaper .
3288	0	a	If you if you make it cool to have
3289	0	a	Oh , that is just great .
3290	0	a	Oh , costs nothing .
3291	0	a	Oh , alright .
3292	0	a	That is nice .
3293	0	a	Plastic is
3294	0	a	Yes ,
3295	0	a	but I just got it .
3296	0	a	Well that is pretty l
3297	0	a	N not very practical .
3298	0	a	That is pretty stupid .
3299	0	a	Well But I am
3300	0	a	n I do not agree .
3301	0	a	Who ?
3302	0	a	You want to dump the titanium ?
3303	0	a	And make all plastic , then we ha then we are there .
3304	0	a	But then we we have got to run through the eval evaluation process again .
3305	0	a	I think
3306	0	a	I think the titanium just provided the the tough look and the and the And also the the older people will like it because of that .
3307	0	a	Th then you have a ugly , stupid , l ugly looking , dumb remote that that no one would buy .
3308	0	a	no no .
3309	0	a	It is not ugly looking .
3310	0	a	The looks remain the same .
3311	0	a	No , I do not think so .
3312	0	a	Y
3313	0	a	Yeah , I agree .
3314	0	a	Well , I do think so .
3315	0	a	Yes .
3316	0	a	And the feel , and th that it is strong , and
3317	0	a	We still
3318	0	a	we had to focus to get more people from the younger group , but not lose the one
3319	0	a	Why ca not I
3320	1	a	I will put in the report we that we think that fourteen point one is the l m lowest price you can make a remote for that is trendy d these days .
3321	0	a	feel .
3322	0	a	And because i
3323	0	a	Alright it is not our target audience , but it is it is useful if it is important for old people .
3324	0	a	Yeah .
3325	0	a	I think the titanium is very important .
3326	0	a	Yeah alright
3327	0	a	but then we we wo not get there .
3328	0	a	Yeah we have a problem , yeah .
3329	1	a	W
3330	1	a	But you can better , yeah , dump the LCD screen then .
3331	1	a	We can dump the special colour .
3332	1	a	We l we use plastic .
3333	0	a	And plastic is already in colour
3334	0	a	I think .
3335	0	a	I do not think you should dump the LCD screen .
3336	1	a	Well what else ?
3337	0	a	W I mean
3338	0	a	Yeah .
3339	0	a	No , nothing .
3340	0	a	Or you shou
3341	0	a	It is
3342	1	a	Or change the titanium or dump the LCD screen .
3343	0	a	Amen .
3344	0	a	But I think you could better change titanium to hard a hard kind of plastic looking like titanium than lose the LCD screen .
3345	0	a	Yeah .
3346	0	a	Because you have lots of functions in it too .
3347	0	a	Yeah ,
3348	0	a	well yeah .
3349	0	a	Yeah .
3350	0	a	Alright .
3351	0	a	I agree with that .
3352	0	a	But
3353	0	a	No no no no .
3354	0	a	So we u we use Unfortunately .
3355	0	a	Titanium coloured plastic .
3356	0	a	Yeah , I agree .
3357	1	a	So titanium coloured plastic for the back .
3358	1	a	I I will talk to the managers .
3359	0	a	W Titanium stays there .
3360	0	a	Titanium , I thi
3361	0	a	I think
3362	0	a	this
3363	0	a	this is this is e really good re remote .
3364	0	a	Yeah this is good , but
3365	0	a	it it is not good enough .
3366	0	a	Osl
3367	0	a	If you do not have the money , you ca not make it .
3368	0	a	But
3369	0	a	those those account managers , what do th d what do they know ?
3370	0	a	Come on .
3371	0	a	So we have to use the ditch the titanium , I am afraid .
3372	0	a	Well
3373	0	a	No
3374	0	a	because we did not know anything about it .
3375	0	a	What do we
3376	0	a	Well what do we know ?
3377	0	a	All we want is a is a fancy design
3378	0	a	but we do not really consider the costs .
3379	0	a	Riot .
3380	0	a	Yes , yes .
3381	0	a	So
3382	0	a	Yeah al alright , yeah .
3383	0	a	One and a half Euros .
3384	0	a	But we have to deal with it now .
3385	0	a	So ?
3386	0	a	Well , no it is just all plastic .
3387	0	a	So s
3388	0	a	If you do not have the money , you ca not make it .
3389	0	a	So
3390	0	a	So
3391	1	a	Titanium gone and add plastic .
3392	0	a	So this is too expensive .
3393	0	a	So we have to make it cheaper .
3394	0	a	Right .
3395	0	a	Yeah , but then we have got money left .
3396	1	a	And on plastic times two
3397	0	a	and then we are there ?
3398	0	a	No
3399	0	a	No
3400	0	a	yeah
3401	0	a	well
3402	0	a	Oh six .
3403	0	a	Well alright .
3404	0	a	Huh .
3405	0	a	A lot of plastic , yeah .
3406	0	a	It is just free , man .
3407	0	a	Four .
3408	0	a	So
3409	0	a	But then we can add the special colour ?
3410	0	a	As we have money over left .
3411	1	a	No two for the to make it clear .
3412	0	a	Yeah .
3413	0	a	Yeah .
3414	0	a	And we still have money left .
3415	0	a	W
3416	0	a	Well I think the case is double curved then .
3417	1	a	What do we want , guys ?
3418	0	a	Yes .
3419	1	a	I want gold plating .
3420	0	a	No no
3421	0	a	We have we have to fill W we ha
3422	0	a	No no no ,
3423	0	a	but th that is not f
3424	0	a	Well you can you can double curve , if you do not have titanium .
3425	0	a	Yeah right .
3426	1	a	I want chrome .
3427	0	a	Because you y have that curve and you have that curve .
3428	0	a	Y Oh no .
3429	0	a	Yeah well
3430	0	a	Well y we have curves in all directions .
3431	0	a	Well , th that that is the problem .
3432	0	a	Alright .
3433	0	a	Safe .
3434	0	a	And that we dropped , so it it can be done .
3435	0	a	So alright .
3436	0	a	But it is pretty funny .
3437	0	a	We we do want to reach twelve point five .
3438	0	a	But it is not bad to to to stay at eleven .
3439	0	a	Finance ?
3440	1	a	Well , guys ?
3441	1	a	Guys ?
3442	0	a	We have to dump our titanium , and we will hate the managers for that , but now we are going to evaluate our project , of project ,
3443	0	a	project .
3444	0	a	I mean , this this ai not titanium , but it looks like it .
3445	0	a	We get more salary , if we make if cheaper than twelve twelve and a half .
3446	0	a	Yeah .
3447	0	a	Shoot .
3448	0	a	Objection .
3449	0	a	Pro project .
3450	0	a	Well , satisfaction on for example ,
3451	0	a	are we satisfactory about our creativity ?
3452	0	a	I think it is terrible that we got those costs at the last moment .
3453	0	a	Well I ca not get no satisfaction , but
3454	0	a	I think it is
3455	0	a	Well in in if we consider the costs then this is the best , yeah .
3456	0	a	Yeah .
3457	0	a	Yeah .
3458	0	a	Yeah .
3459	0	a	Yeah , me too .
3460	0	a	That is really bad .
3461	0	a	Its it is ridiculous actually , but Which is not very practical ,
3462	0	a	but that is the way .
3463	0	a	But that that that is that , yeah
3464	0	a	that is a reason , but also for our creativity .
3465	0	a	And unrealistic .
3466	0	a	We had nice design , and then you get the cost , and you had to dump all your creativity .
3467	0	a	Well we we we used our creativity , but we just had to adapt it to the costs .
3468	0	a	Right .
3469	0	a	Yeah .
3470	0	a	Nei .
3471	0	a	no .
3472	0	a	Well , alright .
3473	0	a	Uh huh .
3474	0	a	leadership next .
3475	0	a	Terrible .
3476	0	a	teamwork ?
3477	0	a	yeah
3478	0	a	well I think so also .
3479	0	a	Leadership .
3480	0	a	Leadership ?
3481	0	a	Well
3482	0	a	Yeah .
3483	0	a	Well it is It was very democratic .
3484	0	a	Yeah .
3485	0	a	I
3486	0	a	al I
3487	0	a	I have filled that in in a the questionnaires each time , so
3488	0	a	Well the managers were terrible .
3489	0	a	Yeah yeah .
3490	0	a	So , with their all their useless requirements .
3491	0	a	But o alright , the teamwork ?
3492	0	a	No
3493	0	a	they said , oh we wo not d we wo not use teletext , we wo not use the DVD .
3494	0	a	Well they they did not think of the requirements .
3495	0	a	It is the requirements of the user , I guess .
3496	0	a	Yeah .
3497	0	a	Yeah
3498	0	a	but they base that on on the user specifications .
3499	0	a	Alright ,
3500	0	a	teamwork ?
3501	0	a	Well great I think .
3502	0	a	Well
3503	0	a	Yeah , think so too .
3504	0	a	Right
3505	0	a	yeah .
3506	0	a	well what do you , what did you think about the SMARTboard ?
3507	0	a	Well
3508	0	a	It is also a It is both the SMARTboards .
3509	0	a	It was a complete disaster .
3510	0	a	No it
3511	0	a	it
3512	0	a	it
3513	0	a	it is
3514	0	a	No it is other way around .
3515	0	a	Yeah , I do not like it .
3516	0	a	No ,
3517	0	a	that is a SMARTboard , and that is a digital pen .
3518	0	a	Yeah ?
3519	0	a	This this this is not a SMARTboard , right ?
3520	0	a	Yeah right .
3521	0	a	Or not ?
3522	0	a	Oh they are both SMARTboards .
3523	0	a	That is the SMARTboard .
3524	0	a	That is the digital panel .
3525	0	a	I liked this SMARTboard , but I hated that one .
3526	0	a	Well it is both a SMARTboard .
3527	0	a	That is that is the smart
3528	0	a	A televi
3529	0	a	Yeah .
3530	0	a	B but you
3531	0	a	This is just a large t large television .
3532	0	a	No .
3533	0	a	You u you use the Yeah , but you ca
3534	0	a	This is just a beamer function .
3535	0	a	It is both a SMARTboard , but this one is used for a desktop , and that one is used to to draw .
3536	0	a	And here , on this one , you can draw the pictures and things like that .
3537	0	a	Well , wi w which one did you like ?
3538	0	a	That one .
3539	0	a	But That one .
3540	0	a	Yeah .
3541	0	a	Left or right ?
3542	0	a	Well I did not use
3543	0	a	Nei It it is much m
3544	0	a	But you can
3545	0	a	I
3546	0	a	I sent it about three times now .
3547	0	a	Yeah .
3548	0	a	That one is not accurate .
3549	0	a	It just does not work .
3550	0	a	Yeah .
3551	0	a	You can
3552	0	a	Yeah ,
3553	0	a	but I think there is a big distinction between the these th I do not need a SMARTboard .
3554	0	a	But I I think this is meant by the digital pen .
3555	0	a	Yes .
3556	0	a	Th that is so .
3557	0	a	Yeah .
3558	0	a	We are now talking about the SMARTboards .
3559	0	a	Well we we used that one , and we needed it .
3560	0	a	Yeah ,
3561	0	a	but give me a beamer .
3562	0	a	I think .
3563	0	a	That is that is much much cheaper .
3564	0	a	Yeah alright ,
3565	0	a	but Yeah I like that one , but that one is terrible .
3566	1	a	Or install a laptop to a beamer , or have this one standing here in an
3567	0	a	I I like it .
3568	0	a	Right .
3569	0	a	Okay , alright .
3570	0	a	a green board with chalk is much more useful than that thing .
3571	0	a	Yeah .
3572	0	a	Yeah .
3573	0	a	Yeah , it is .
3574	0	a	The simple sch school board .
3575	0	a	So
3576	0	a	And the digi the digital pen ?
3577	0	a	Did did you like that one ?
3578	0	a	I used it just to check it out , but You you ca not send that to anyone , because you you have scrabbled something on a page for yourself , and then you are going to send it , yeah .
3579	0	a	I agree .
3580	0	a	No .
3581	0	a	I
3582	0	a	I did not use it .
3583	0	a	I wrote things down
3584	0	a	but I did not import it into my laptop .
3585	0	a	Yeah .
3586	0	a	That is the
3587	0	a	W
3588	0	a	But also y you write things down .
3589	0	a	Yeah .
3590	0	a	It is not practical .
3591	0	a	Right .
3592	0	a	Well , no .
3593	0	a	And i you can also bring your your your note block .
3594	0	a	Your notepad .
3595	0	a	So what is the what is the th what is the point of importing it into
3596	0	a	Yeah alright .
3597	0	a	Yeah .
3598	0	a	It is , no , it it is useless .
3599	0	a	Well I I drew this .
3600	0	a	And I made a mistake .
3601	0	a	But it it would have been useful , if I I could show this on the screen .
3602	0	a	Yes .
3603	0	a	For drawings , yes .
3604	0	a	For drawings ,
3605	0	a	but not for personal notes .
3606	0	a	Yeah for drawings .
3607	0	a	I think that is not very
3608	0	a	I mean you can bring your paperwork along and p
3609	0	a	Well of course if you have a lot of paper
3610	0	a	If you have If you have
3611	0	a	Yeah I understand .
3612	0	a	N notes .
3613	0	a	But
3614	0	a	But for notes , it i you you have to put that in a strict you have to put a name , standard date , and all those things .
3615	0	a	Yeah , it might be useful for drawings .
3616	0	a	I I agree on that .
3617	0	a	And notes for a meeting are very strict .
3618	0	a	So if you were to write them down for yourself , and then put that in your computer , you still have to type it over to Word .
3619	0	a	Yeah , right .
3620	0	a	So it does not d does not have any
3621	0	a	Yep .
3622	0	a	That Stefan use .
3623	0	a	But I think d this option is only useful if you have got a lot of paperwork .
3624	0	a	You ca not It is not very ni
3625	0	a	Yeah well a lot of documents are
3626	0	a	Yeah .
3627	0	a	No , I do not think so .
3628	0	a	It is it is only useful if you have to draw something .
3629	0	a	Yeah .
3630	0	a	But then it is really useful , I think .
3631	0	a	Yeah .
3632	0	a	Alright .
3633	0	a	Mu Yeah right .
3634	0	a	etcetera ?
3635	0	a	Well the laptops ?

3655	0	a	No .
3656	0	a	I have not looked w one time directly at the camera .
3657	0	a	So
3658	1	a	But we should not talk about that .
3659	0	a	I do not care about it .
3660	0	a	Well I did .
3661	0	a	Because this is a realistic environment .
3662	0	a	Well w why not ?
3663	0	a	etcetera We
3664	0	a	N new ideas found ?
3665	1	a	What kind of ideas for n a future schedule
3666	1	a	What ?
3667	1	a	For future meetings you have got ?
3668	0	a	Chatting and emailing .
3669	0	a	Right .
3670	0	a	Okay .
3671	0	a	Well I missed the option to to email ,

3674	0	a	Email or chat or something .
3675	0	a	Yeah , right .
3676	0	a	But yeah .
3677	0	a	W well th that is just the the environment they set us up
3678	0	a	f with .
3679	0	a	Yeah .
3680	0	a	So
3681	0	a	Well , for drawing for drawings .
3682	0	a	Yeah alright ,
3683	0	a	but that is one n new idea .
3684	0	a	Yeah , I agree .
3685	0	a	Well , new ideas found by this .
3686	0	a	Not .
3687	0	a	Nothing .
3688	1	a	Well , more more information in the beginning .
3689	0	a	We do not want this .
3690	0	a	We hate this .
3691	0	a	Yeah .
3692	0	a	That is
3693	0	a	For people who sketch th the whole day , I can imagine that it is useful .
3694	0	a	Digital pen is useless .
3695	0	a	No it is not .
3696	0	a	So Yeah , for drawings .
3697	0	a	Yeah .
3698	0	a	Yeah .
3699	0	a	So it is not useless .
3700	0	a	But two t
3701	0	a	But th then you have to have a lot of drawings , because if I had a company and I am going to buy those expensive huge expensive things , I and I have to w pay those papers that are expensive , I am not going to
3702	0	a	Well th then still
3703	0	a	they they
3704	0	a	they should have a a nice graphics programme on the laptop .
3705	0	a	Well No
3706	0	a	But it is still an expensive expensive
3707	0	a	But if w Yeah .
3708	0	a	Yeah .
3709	0	a	Because this is huge this v very very expensive paper .
3710	0	a	Well
3711	0	a	Yeah , I agree .
3712	0	a	Well you you ca not you ca not draw on a laptop like you like you paint of or draw with your hand .
3713	0	a	With the mouse it is No .
3714	0	a	Yeah .
3715	0	a	Well and if
3716	0	a	And but what if maybe this this board SMARTboard is malfunctioning or someone .
3717	0	a	Mouse is ju just is not working if you are sketching .
3718	0	a	indeed .
3719	1	a	But suppose it was working correctly ,
3720	0	a	what would it be useful then , if it was not off all the time ?
3721	0	a	A
3722	0	a	Really ?
3723	0	a	Anything you want .
3724	0	a	Well no .
3725	0	a	I hated to draw like that .
3726	0	a	You you ca not draw anything neat .
3727	0	a	Yeah , but he is saying if it is correct , and you can draw very , yeah , very precise
3728	0	a	Yeah , mu
3729	0	a	It saves time .
3730	0	a	Any b b Yeah .
3731	1	a	I if it if it would be perfect following .
3732	0	a	L li li
3733	0	a	Yeah .
3734	0	a	Well th th then still it is it is it is very expensive towards a a just a green school board .
3735	0	a	Well it is not ,
3736	0	a	but maybe that thing is is
3737	0	a	Yeah , board , a school board ,
3738	0	a	yeah .
3739	0	a	Yeah ,
3740	0	a	but but then you can save it in instantly , and and and re use it , and
3741	0	a	Yeah .
3742	0	a	Yep .
3743	0	a	I it has It is useful .
3744	0	a	Yeah .
3745	0	a	Yeah yeah .
3746	0	a	This if it works correct ,
3747	1	a	maybe this thing this thing is just malfunctioning .
3748	0	a	So if we get in if we get another one
3749	0	a	and you make sure it does work ,
3750	0	a	I think then it is pretty useful .
3751	0	a	Yep .
3752	0	a	Yeah .
3753	0	a	Because yeah you can draw t things quickly and clearly for anyone in the discussion room .
3754	0	a	And then you can save it immediately .
3755	0	a	Well , they are now .
3756	0	a	Celebration .

3971	0	a	Big one , they are not easy to use .
3972	0	a	I have one set and a remote control , when I dropped it , it broke .
3973	0	a	So that wo not be our goal , I think .
3974	0	a	No .
3975	0	a	And g big buttons ,
3976	0	a	m that is easier to use than I think .
3977	0	a	Not all the small buttons , you do not know Big buttons , positive .
3978	0	a	Is this positive or negative , that big buttons ?
3979	0	a	Positive .
3980	0	a	All all small buttons like when you have like a hundred buttons on your remote control , you wo not know what they are working for .
3981	0	a	Okay .
3982	0	a	What are your experiences ?
3983	0	a	well I think the the the goal of a remote control is that it is it it has an influence on the TV set .
3984	0	a	And that it controls the channels and the the volume .
3985	0	a	And I I
3986	0	a	I think it is positive if there is a a LED a LED on the corner of the of the remote .
3987	0	a	So that you know it s it still has batteries on it in it .
3988	0	a	And that if you push the button the LED gives a light , and and you see that it is working .
3989	0	a	And yeah .
3990	0	a	Yeah , but
3991	0	a	No no no .
3992	0	a	So and do they always have that ?
3993	0	a	It is easy to you .
3994	0	a	But I my my experience is that it
3995	0	a	it
3996	0	a	it is convenient to have that .
3997	0	a	Yeah .
3998	0	a	Okay .
3999	0	a	Yeah .
4000	1	a	Kay .
4001	0	a	at home we have a TV , a video recorder , a DVD player , and a satellite receiver .
4002	0	a	We have four distinctive remote controls for that .
4003	0	a	Thank you .
4004	0	a	That is not really ea easy .
4005	0	a	Help also .
4006	0	a	So it would be nice if we have one for all .
4007	0	a	Thank you .
4008	0	a	And we also had a remote control for our radio set .
4009	0	a	But i it it had a lot of buttons on it , and you did not know which one was what .
4010	0	a	And it was v not easy to use .
4011	0	a	So we n barely used it .
4012	0	a	Okay so they have too much .
4013	0	a	So next .
4014	0	a	For our own remote control we have to think how do we make it .
4015	1	a	So what ideas do you have for it , for the new remote control ?
4016	1	a	What what does it have to have ?
4017	0	a	Not too heavy .
4018	1	a	The weight .
4019	1	a	Not not too heavy .
4020	1	a	Not much buttons .
4021	0	a	Yes .
4022	1	a	Yeah .
4023	1	a	Bust free .
4024	0	a	That when you drop it , it wo not break .
4025	1	a	Like some kind of rubber on it .
4026	1	a	Or hard hard plastic .
4027	1	a	buttons not too small .
4028	0	a	something like when you lose your remote control , sometimes it happen .
4029	0	a	Yes .
4030	0	a	it between the couch and you ca not find it .
4031	1	a	When you push a but a button on the TV , then you hear some some sort of bleep .
4032	0	a	Like a phone .
4033	0	a	And then you , hey there there is remote control .
4034	0	a	Yeah .
4035	0	a	Okay .
4036	0	a	Yeah .
4037	0	a	So ,
4038	0	a	that is .
4039	1	a	Next .
4040	0	a	Yeah well that is that are good ideas .
4041	1	a	Yeah well the LED on the corner , that that indicates that it is working .
4042	1	a	If you push a button .
4043	0	a	Yeah .
4044	1	a	And looking on the budget , not too expensive material .
4045	1	a	So probably plastic or something .
4046	0	a	no .
4047	0	a	Okay .
4048	1	a	Yeah I think it from a marketing point of view , it also has to look nice .
4049	0	a	Or you wo not sell it .
4050	1	a	Yes .
4051	0	a	And yeah
4052	0	a	on our website we can see what products we already have .
4053	1	a	And it should work with as many as possible of them .
4054	0	a	Okay .
4055	0	a	This is It has to be compatible with other things .
4056	0	a	Yes .
4057	0	a	Okay .
4058	0	a	I have one more idea .
4059	0	a	Just popped up .
4060	1	a	Yes ?
4061	0	a	No battery use .
4062	1	a	it it wo not take a lot of batteries .
4063	1	a	So you do not wo not have to change the batteries once a week or once every two weeks .
4064	0	a	So
4065	1	a	more ideas ?
4066	0	a	No okay .
4067	0	a	It is only the first ideas .
4068	0	a	So
4069	0	a	what are we going to do now is Next meeting is in half an h hour .
4070	0	a	Okay .
4071	0	a	Next meeting , half an hour .
4072	1	a	, what you have to do .
4073	1	a	Well look on your .
4074	0	a	And Next instructions you will get in your email .
4075	0	a	So This is the first meeting .
4076	0	a	Okay .
4077	0	a	 
4078	0	a	Okay .
4079	0	a	So welcome back .
4080	0	a	What do do we have to do ?
4081	0	a	So
4082	0	a	first .
4083	0	a	I want to say I am the secretary , so I make the minutes .
4084	0	a	You find them in your in the map in the From the group .
4085	0	a	There is the minutes from the first meeting .
4086	0	a	You will find the next minutes also there .
4087	0	a	Then
4088	0	a	I want to hear from you , what you have done .
4089	0	a	And after that I have some new product requirements .
4090	0	a	So And after that we have to make decisions , what we will do .
4091	0	a	And then we are ready .
4092	0	a	We have forty minutes for this meeting .
4093	0	a	After that we will have lunch .
4094	1	a	So first I want to ask the Industrial Designer to tell what he did .
4095	1	a	That is my task .
4096	1	a	So
4097	0	a	Yeah on your computer , or the What is the name ?
4098	0	a	What is the name of it ?
4099	1	a	It is the technical function or the functional requirements .
4100	1	a	Okay .
4101	0	a	I have
4102	0	a	Where have I put it ?
4103	1	a	My Documents or not ?
4104	0	a	I have save it on my computer , my presentation .
4105	0	a	But where ?
4106	0	a	It was about the working of the remote control .
4107	0	a	Nope .
4108	0	a	Not a of
4109	0	a	Wait .
4110	0	a	The working design .
4111	0	a	But I have saved it .
4112	0	a	Working design .
4113	0	a	But now I do not know where it is .
4114	0	a	Working design .
4115	0	a	What is this ?
4116	0	a	Product documents .
4117	0	a	Yeah .
4118	0	a	And I import this until
4119	0	a	One more .
4120	0	a	On the desktop .
4121	1	a	Up .
4122	1	a	up .
4123	1	a	Up .
4124	1	a	Up .
4125	1	a	Up .
4126	0	a	Yes .
4127	0	a	My Documents .
4128	0	a	Nope .
4129	0	a	What the fuck is this ?
4130	0	a	Yeah that is the empty one .
4131	0	a	Gone .
4132	0	a	Well you Nah .
4133	0	a	Nah , nah , nah .
4134	1	a	PowerPoint .
4135	1	a	Working design .
4136	0	a	And
4137	0	a	Presentation of working design .
4138	0	a	I had one .
4139	0	a	Uh huh .
4140	1	a	Open it .
4141	0	a	Okay here it is .
4142	1	a	Save as .
4143	0	a	it is
4144	1	a	Project .
4145	1	a	Desktop .
4146	0	a	Project .
4147	0	a	Yeah .
4148	0	a	Save .
4149	0	a	Okay .
4150	0	a	Okay .
4151	0	a	Very good .
4152	0	a	Well .
4153	0	a	A little later
4154	0	a	but here it is .
4155	0	a	Okay .
4156	0	a	So
4157	0	a	Now have ten minutes to tell it .
4158	0	a	So okay .
4159	0	a	It is a little difficult what I am going to tell you .
4160	0	a	It is about the working of the remote control .
4161	0	a	I just had an half an hour j to study it
4162	0	a	and I do not get it .
4163	0	a	Make it .
4164	0	a	Ten minutes to tell it .
4165	0	a	Okay .
4166	0	a	I think it will be a few minutes and First I will tell you something about the findings , what I discovered about the remote control .
4167	0	a	Okay .
4168	0	a	The working bout it of it .
4169	0	a	then I will have some kind of map , and it is the top of the remote control .
4170	0	a	With a little bit of science ,
4171	0	a	you
4172	0	a	I will show that in in a few minutes .
4173	0	a	And then what I will think about it .
4174	1	a	First , the findings .
4175	0	a	The remote control is a very difficult thing to to explain to just all of you wh who have not seen a remote control inside .
4176	0	a	there is a lot of plastic on it , because its not so expensive .
4177	0	a	And there are a lot of wires , which connect the components in it , the battery , and there are switches and things like that .
4178	0	a	There is a lot of small electronics .
4179	0	a	So it wo not be too expensive to build it .
4180	0	a	Only twelve Euro fifty
4181	0	a	I think we will make it .
4182	0	a	Now
4183	0	a	And here I have the top of the remote control .
4184	0	a	here is some kind of chip .
4185	0	a	on top of this , there are the numbers .
4186	0	a	you have all on your remote control .
4187	0	a	And the teletext button .
4188	0	a	And here is the battery .
4189	0	a	And when you push the button , it will will be sent to the chip .
4190	0	a	And the chip will send it to all kind of sub components .
4191	0	a	That is what I said , it is very difficult .
4192	0	a	And after that it will be sent to the infrared .
4193	0	a	And that will send it to your television .
4194	0	a	That is a short h how it works .
4195	0	a	I think I can make it difficult , but we all we all do not get it .
4196	1	a	My preferences ?
4197	0	a	It is it wo not be
4198	1	a	We should not make it too big .
4199	1	a	also for the cost , we should only put one battery on it .
4200	1	a	A long lasting battery .
4201	1	a	also for the cost , use only plastic .
4202	1	a	Not other materials .
4203	1	a	Also because of the cost , not too much buttons on it .
4204	1	a	We can also make a button with a menu button .
4205	1	a	And then that that you will see it on the TV .
4206	1	a	And on the TV you can switch into the menu .
4207	0	a	That is I think it is easier .
4208	0	a	And the bleep signal , y you told us .
4209	1	a	but we can also use it a bleep like something , when the battery is empty , then there is a bleep .
4210	0	a	Then you will have to change it in a in a week or something .
4211	0	a	And also the bleep , when what I told you about when you lost it ,
4212	1	a	and you push a button , and then you hear bleep bleep , and we will find it .
4213	0	a	This is just
4214	0	a	Yeah .
4215	1	a	Oh oh .
4216	0	a	Two questions .
4217	0	a	Yeah .
4218	0	a	The battery .
4219	0	a	You say one battery is cheaper .
4220	0	a	Why ?
4221	0	a	Yeah
4222	0	a	but
4223	0	a	when you use two , you can use it two times longer .
4224	0	a	If we w if we use only just one small pen light , then it will be cheaper than when we use two .
4225	0	a	Yeah
4226	0	a	but
4227	0	a	then we will have to make the remote control long lasting .
4228	0	a	Okay so it is the size of the remote control .
4229	0	a	Just
4230	0	a	Yeah .
4231	0	a	Okay and the buttons .
4232	0	a	When you use it on the television , you have you need the television , wh which can use it .
4233	0	a	Yeah .
4234	0	a	But I think this our remote control is for the televisions we we sell in our company ?
4235	1	a	Or is it also for other company for other televisions ?
4236	0	a	Then this is an option .
4237	0	a	Okay .
4238	0	a	I think we have to use it also on other televisions though .
4239	0	a	So
4240	0	a	Yeah
4241	0	a	but I do not
4242	0	a	I think it
4243	0	a	They are two different things though .
4244	1	a	Maybe just a menu button to use it on our televisions .
4245	0	a	And then we make it easier for our televisions .
4246	0	a	And on the other tele televisions , you can also use it ,
4247	0	a	but then we wo not use the
4248	0	a	Yeah ?
4249	0	a	Okay .
4250	0	a	We have to choose one .
4251	0	a	It has to work on o all televisions .
4252	0	a	Then I think the menu button will only work on the newer televisions .
4253	1	a	And we will look forward and do not make a remote control which for the older televisions .
4254	0	a	Okay .
4255	0	a	And I just have one more idea .
4256	0	a	maybe it is one of your tasks .
4257	1	a	But , to have a trendy remote control , we can also make something like the Nokia mobile phones .
4258	1	a	To change covers .
4259	1	a	So if you have a trendy half with all red , yellow and something .
4260	1	a	And then you can put a red cover on it .
4261	1	a	And also different things .
4262	0	a	Yeah .
4263	0	a	Good idea .
4264	0	a	Will this will this add to the cost ?
4265	0	a	Yes
4266	0	a	but you have to m be able to change it .
4267	0	a	Yes .
4268	0	a	then it wo not be will have just one cover on the original one .
4269	0	a	And then you can buy the covers .
4270	0	a	D does it make it more difficult to design ?
4271	0	a	Not much .
4272	0	a	I think it will be a little more difficult , but not too much .
4273	0	a	Kay .
4274	0	a	Just like with the Nokia mobile phones .
4275	0	a	Yeah but there are much more Nokia telephones than these ones .
4276	0	a	Just one .
4277	1	a	Yeah but then we will have to to just put five covers on it , and see if it works .
4278	0	a	If it wo not works then we will get something else .
4279	0	a	Then we wo not g go further with it .
4280	0	a	Yeah but are their profits bigger than their cost ?
4281	0	a	Yeah but there are also design cost .
4282	0	a	a p a a cover made in in China , it it wo not be I guess so expensive I think .
4283	0	a	I do not think
4284	0	a	When you have a remote control , do you change the cover ?
4285	0	a	Would you change the cover ?
4286	0	a	No .
4287	0	a	Maybe .
4288	0	a	I wi I wo not .
4289	0	a	But maybe I think trendy people or like children where you can paint on it , and the the children think , oh this is my remote control , I made a picture on it .
4290	0	a	N
4291	0	a	yeah
4292	0	a	but
4293	0	a	I think that too less people would change it for good profit .
4294	0	a	Yeah .
4295	0	a	So Yes it is
4296	0	a	but I do not think we have to do it .
4297	0	a	Okay .
4298	0	a	And the other people ?
4299	0	a	What do you think about it ?
4300	0	a	Okay .
4301	0	a	Yeah it is a good idea .
4302	0	a	But
4303	0	a	If if it
4304	0	a	Yeah , I do not
4305	0	a	I am not sure if it will make profit enough to
4306	0	a	But it is
4307	0	a	yeah
4308	0	a	it is original idea .
4309	0	a	No .
4310	0	a	Okay .
4311	0	a	You are the Project Manager .
4312	0	a	Okay .
4313	0	a	Yes .
4314	0	a	That is it .
4315	0	a	That is clear .
4316	0	a	Okay thank you .
4317	0	a	So now the User Interface Designer .
4318	0	a	Oh .
4319	0	a	That is me .
4320	0	a	Come on .
4321	0	a	Yeah .
4322	0	a	Yes well I shall give a short talk about the the technical function design .
4323	0	a	I thought the the the technical function design was to for a remote control to to to have some influence on the TV set .
4324	0	a	both audio and vide video in a cordless way .
4325	0	a	No cords attached .
4326	0	a	And well , it all by pushing a button on the remote .
4327	0	a	That was from my own experience and and the previous meeting .
4328	0	a	I find some some interesting quotes on the web .
4329	0	a	well the same idea here .
4330	0	a	message to the television .
4331	0	a	And and and and well basic operations like on and off , and switching channels , and and maybe teletext or something like that .
4332	0	a	well these are two remotes ,
4333	0	a	and that is our our dilemma I think .
4334	0	a	We just heard from the Industrial Designer how difficult it is .
4335	1	a	But shall we make a basic remote control , just swapping channels and volume and power button and well nothing much more .
4336	1	a	Or more functions on the remote .
4337	1	a	maybe more devices you can influence .
4338	1	a	a radio or a v a video recorder , VCR .
4339	0	a	Yeah
4340	0	a	well that is our dilemma .
4341	1	a	any ideas about that ?
4342	1	a	Basic or multifunctional ?
4343	0	a	Okay yeah .
4344	0	a	We will got back on that later .
4345	0	a	Yeah well the
4346	0	a	that was just on my mind .
4347	0	a	Yes .
4348	0	a	So I did not know what what way we would go .
4349	0	a	yeah
4350	0	a	well that was my functional talk .
4351	0	a	Kay .
4352	0	a	Kay , thank you .
4353	0	a	Then it is your turn , the marketing expert .
4354	0	a	Okay .
4355	0	a	m
4356	0	a	Yeah .
4357	0	a	yeah okay .
4358	0	a	This bit too far .
4359	0	a	So
4360	0	a	So I am going to have a presentation about the market , about
4361	0	a	yeah
4362	0	a	what people think .
4363	0	a	we did a usability lab test with a hundred persons .
4364	0	a	And we looked at several things .
4365	0	a	among them design , d d how d did they like the use of it , what frustrations they had while using remote controls .
4366	0	a	well what what will be our market .
4367	0	a	And we asked them if we had some new featu features .
4368	0	a	If that would be a good idea or not .
4369	0	a	Well our findings .
4370	0	a	our users , they disliked the look and feel of current remote controls .
4371	0	a	they especially found found them very ugly .
4372	0	a	And th they also found them hard to to learn how to use it .
4373	0	a	well they also zap a lot .
4374	1	a	So zapping should be very easy .
4375	0	a	And fifty percent of the users only use ten percent of the buttons .
4376	0	a	So a lot of unused buttons .
4377	0	a	There is more findings .
4378	0	a	on the buttons .
4379	0	a	Which buttons find users very important and which which not ?
4380	0	a	And how much would they use them ?
4381	0	a	Well the most used button is the channel selection .
4382	0	a	And we asked them how relevant they think the buttons are .
4383	0	a	The power , volume and channel selections are very relevant .
4384	0	a	teletext is less relevant but also important .
4385	0	a	not important they found the audio , that is not the volume but specific the the pitch , or the left or right .
4386	0	a	the screen and the brightness .
4387	0	a	And channel settings .
4388	0	a	th
4389	0	a	and they also are not used very often .
4390	0	a	Then we have a few graphs about the market .
4391	0	a	here we can see what the market share is of several groups .
4392	0	a	as you can see , most users are between thirty six and forty five .
4393	0	a	the the the younger group between sixteen and twenty five is not very big .
4394	0	a	And to come back on the the swapping things , I do not think ,
4395	0	a	I
4396	0	a	I think the younger will be most interest in it .
4397	0	a	But they are not a very big group .
4398	0	a	in the we asked them , how would you like a s a new feature .
4399	0	a	If you have an LCD on the remote control , what would you think of it .
4400	0	a	Now you can clearly see young users say .
4401	0	a	I will that would very nice .
4402	0	a	And older user think they will be scared of change I think .
4403	0	a	And they wo not like it .
4404	0	a	And another thing , how would you like to have a speech recognition on it .
4405	0	a	Well here we see the same .
4406	0	a	Young users think that is an interesting idea .
4407	0	a	And old users not .
4408	0	a	well we found out that there are two several markets at which we can aim .
4409	0	a	the first are the younger , the age between sixteen and forty five .
4410	0	a	they are highly interested in the features , as you can see here .
4411	0	a	And they are more critical on their money spending .
4412	0	a	the second group is the older group .
4413	0	a	Aged between forty six and sixty five .
4414	0	a	They are less interested in new features .
4415	0	a	But they spend their money more easily .
4416	0	a	Now if we look back at this graph , we can see that among the first group is about sixty percent .
4417	0	a	And the second group about forty percent .
4418	0	a	So the the first group is bigger .
4419	0	a	Well then I come to my personal preferences .
4420	0	a	yeah the first question is also we have to ask is at the which market do we aim at .
4421	0	a	of course n saying we aim at the young group does not say that old people wo not buy it .
4422	0	a	But less of them will buy it .
4423	0	a	well I
4424	0	a	Okay .
4425	0	a	What I thought , even young people say it is hard to use , remote control .
4426	0	a	So if you make a remote control that is very easy to use , that is especially aimed at this group , even the young group will also be more interested .
4427	0	a	And we can make special features .
4428	0	a	But I think it looks nice in the first time .
4429	0	a	But when use it , I do not know what is good thing of speech recognition .
4430	0	a	well th that is my second point .
4431	0	a	less important functions should be discarded from the remote control .
4432	0	a	It is about discussion we had earlier .
4433	0	a	You can find most functions on a TV set .
4434	0	a	So you do not have to have a lot of audio options , or screen options to change the brightness .
4435	0	a	And such things .
4436	0	a	well the design is very important .
4437	0	a	One thing I did not say I think , is that a lot of users also said then I would buy a good looking remote control if there will be one .
4438	0	a	But they found most remote controls very ugly .
4439	0	a	So the design of our remote control is very important .
4440	0	a	And yeah it should be very zap friendly , as most users use it for that .
4441	0	a	That were my findings .
4442	0	a	Okay thank you .
4443	0	a	Yeah .
4444	0	a	I have one question .
4445	0	a	If we aim for the younger people , and there will be a lot of features like LCD or the the the speech f recognising , the cost will be a lot of h a lot higher .
4446	0	a	Yes .
4447	0	a	Yes .
4448	0	a	I think we do not have that in our budget .
4449	0	a	No .
4450	0	a	Do you think ?
4451	0	a	Like
4452	0	a	No .
4453	0	a	No .
4454	0	a	And I do not I do not think twenty five Euros for a remote is really cheap or something .
4455	0	a	No .
4456	0	a	So it is
4457	0	a	Yeah , it is hard to get the younger group .
4458	0	a	Uh huh .
4459	0	a	I think the LCD is cheaper than speech recognition .
4460	0	a	So I think that can be an d good option .
4461	0	a	LCD .
4462	0	a	Just the LCD ?
4463	0	a	Yes .
4464	0	a	Only the LCD .
4465	0	a	So
4466	0	a	But we will come back on that .
4467	0	a	Okay .
4468	0	a	Now
4469	0	a	Oh , go on .
4470	0	a	What d d d
4471	0	a	we go back on the decisions later .
4472	0	a	Now we have a few new product requirements .
4473	0	a	First , teletext .
4474	0	a	We have internet now so we do not need the teletext anymore .
4475	0	a	So not necessary .
4476	0	a	Next .
4477	0	a	Only for the television .
4478	0	a	So we do not look at the other things like the radio or something .
4479	0	a	Only the television .
4480	0	a	We look at the age group of forty plus .
4481	0	a	no , younger than forty .
4482	0	a	Is a g big group , and like you showed , n not very much people buy our stuff .
4483	0	a	Fourth point .
4484	0	a	Our corporate colour and slogan must be used .
4485	0	a	Very important for the design .
4486	0	a	So you can see it on our site .
4487	0	a	Next .
4488	0	a	no .
4489	0	a	We have to make our decisions , what we want to do .
4490	0	a	So like you said , we need the .
4491	1	a	Maybe it is good to put it in a document .
4492	0	a	Now we have to decide what controls do we need .
4493	1	a	So maybe you can tell us .
4494	1	a	Yeah maybe we can first have a discussion on the the product requirements you just said .
4495	0	a	Sorry ?
4496	0	a	Yes .
4497	0	a	The the requirements you just said ,
4498	1	a	maybe we should first have a discussion about that .
4499	0	a	Yes , it is okay .
4500	0	a	I personally think teletext is a good option .
4501	0	a	not everyone who is looking TV can go to internet when they want to see the latest news .
4502	0	a	Yeah but we do not use it .
4503	0	a	It is a new requirement .
4504	0	a	So , it is not my requirement .
4505	0	a	Kay , we will just have to do that .
4506	0	a	We have to do this .
4507	0	a	Okay .
4508	0	a	Okay .
4509	0	a	No discussion about it .
4510	0	a	Okay sorry .
4511	0	a	Then
4512	0	a	Mine ?
4513	0	a	It is the functional requirements .
4514	0	a	No .
4515	0	a	Okay .
4516	0	a	Unfortunately .
4517	0	a	So
4518	1	a	what controls do we need ?
4519	1	a	Who first ?
4520	0	a	Okay .
4521	1	a	Well a power button ?
4522	1	a	the well I think separate channels .
4523	0	a	power .
4524	1	a	So But then both the the separate channels .
4525	0	a	channel .
4526	1	a	So so zero to nine or something .
4527	0	a	Channel
4528	0	a	Zero to nine .
4529	1	a	volume .
4530	0	a	Volume .
4531	1	a	Maybe it is easy to pick .
4532	0	a	What was w your one ?
4533	0	a	Techno
4534	0	a	Okay .
4535	0	a	We had w
4536	0	a	no no no no .
4537	0	a	Where was that example of the
4538	0	a	Johan .
4539	0	a	Oh mine .
4540	0	a	That was the the the the the
4541	0	a	technical
4542	0	a	Hallo .
4543	0	a	Technical .
4544	0	a	Okay .
4545	0	a	What do we need ?
4546	0	a	On off .
4547	0	a	Zero to nine .
4548	0	a	To change to the next channel , just one button .
4549	0	a	To move up , move down .
4550	0	a	Yeah that is the channel .
4551	0	a	D
4552	0	a	Yeah .
4553	0	a	Do we make a menu ?
4554	1	a	I think it will be q quite easy to use , to have four arrows .
4555	0	a	Menu ?
4556	0	a	yes the n newer televisions ha do have menus .
4557	0	a	M Menu .
4558	1	a	I think the only one or two numbers .
4559	0	a	yes .
4560	0	a	And
4561	0	a	Hello ?
4562	0	a	That is ch
4563	0	a	Yes .
4564	1	a	Up down for channel selection , and left right for volume .
4565	1	a	And a menu button .
4566	1	a	And if you press the menu button you get into the menu , and you can use the same buttons .
4567	1	a	But the then to scroll through the menu and to change the options .
4568	0	a	On the LCD screen , you mean ?
4569	0	a	Think it is better to have it on the remote control , cause it it has to work on all televisions .
4570	0	a	well yeah that depends on if you have the menu on the TV .
4571	0	a	Or you get the menu on the LCD screen on the remote control .
4572	0	a	So
4573	0	a	we need
4574	0	a	N
4575	0	a	Yes .
4576	0	a	Yes .
4577	0	a	But then we come to the costs .
4578	0	a	But if we have this
4579	0	a	So now we do not have a lot of buttons .
4580	0	a	Kay .
4581	0	a	But well if you aim at the younger market , a as they as s as we seen in the usability lab , they will buy a nice looking remote control .
4582	0	a	And also to find the easy to use part very important .
4583	0	a	So if we have a LCD sh screen , and not too many buttons , I think that will incre even when it is a bit more cost , it will still sell .
4584	0	a	Is this enough ?
4585	0	a	Mute .
4586	1	a	Mute .
4587	1	a	Maybe in the menu ?
4588	0	a	Mute .
4589	0	a	Yeah .
4590	0	a	Okay .
4591	1	a	Maybe more ?
4592	0	a	No .
4593	0	a	Well .
4594	0	a	Then that is all .
4595	0	a	This will be the buttons .
4596	0	a	And
4597	0	a	I think that is enough for the next phase .
4598	0	a	So we can go on to
4599	0	a	Yes .
4600	0	a	But now we have only the buttons .
4601	0	a	And we do not yet have to decide what the remote control would look like ?
4602	0	a	Or
4603	0	a	Okay .
4604	0	a	No that is for the next phase .
4605	0	a	Phase two is the conceptual design .
4606	0	a	So then we will have the concepts .
4607	0	a	Okay .
4608	0	a	Okay .
4609	0	a	That is for the
4610	0	a	So next point .
4611	0	a	Now we have lunch break .
4612	0	a	After that we have t thirty minutes for work .
4613	0	a	And you can find the minutes in the Project Documents folder inclusive the buttons .
4614	0	a	No .
4615	0	a	Your individual action , you can find them in the email .
4616	0	a	So now it is time for lunch .
4617	0	a	Okay .
4618	0	a	 
4619	0	a	Okay .
4620	1	a	Well , let is start .
4621	0	a	What are we doing ?
4622	0	a	Oops .
4623	0	a	, pinball .
4624	0	a	Okay .
4625	0	a	Okay .
4626	0	a	Not doing .
4627	0	a	Very good .
4628	0	a	Oh .
4629	0	a	Hey .
4630	0	a	Now I have my screen back too .
4631	0	a	Okay .
4632	0	a	Yeah .
4633	0	a	we have presentations .
4634	1	a	So first , it is your turn .
4635	0	a	Mine .
4636	0	a	Oh , great .
4637	0	a	Yeah .
4638	0	a	Huh .
4639	0	a	Is not it amazing .
4640	0	a	Yeah .
4641	0	a	Very interesting .
4642	0	a	Yes , well
4643	1	a	let is talk about the interface concept .
4644	0	a	Industrial Designer .
4645	0	a	Interface concept .
4646	1	a	, first I will I will discuss the buttons we just chose , show you some samples , discuss some colours and design maybe , already .
4647	1	a	And my personal preferences .
4648	0	a	Well we chose the power button to switch the television on and off .
4649	0	a	The bu
4650	0	a	the mute button to switch the volume on and o on and off .
4651	0	a	The channels buttons , one to nine ,
4652	0	a	and off
4653	0	a	zero to nine , and the button to choose higher channels than nine .
4654	0	a	the volume and channel quadrants , left and right , up and down arrows , to do the volume and channel .
4655	0	a	And the menu menu button to man manipulate the LCD display .
4656	0	a	, I found some interesting samples .
4657	0	a	Examples .
4658	0	a	, well what is pretty standard is that it is that they are all pretty high
4659	0	a	Yeah .
4660	0	a	Large .
4661	0	a	A lot a lot of buttons buttons .
4662	0	a	Yeah .
4663	0	a	Large and and and pretty thin and and long .
4664	0	a	, power buttons are mostly at the top left or right .
4665	0	a	, well we see the the the same arrows .
4666	0	a	Like there .
4667	0	a	And
4668	0	a	Yeah , well arrow b buttons can be blue .
4669	0	a	And what is interesting is the the the icons on the buttons .
4670	0	a	Some buttons have icons like the play and stop , but we do not use that .
4671	0	a	But , these we we have to choose the right icons , or or letters .
4672	0	a	this is the V for volume , but they are both a V .
4673	0	a	So it is it is not really very clear what is the function of that .
4674	0	a	Yeah .
4675	0	a	Yeah .
4676	0	a	So , that is
4677	0	a	, well
4678	0	a	Yeah .
4679	1	a	Can you go back one page ?
4680	0	a	For the menu , what do we use for that ?
4681	0	a	We do not have buttons for the menu .
4682	0	a	Or we may have to use channel of the volume and channel .
4683	0	a	I thought that was our idea .
4684	0	a	Okay .
4685	0	a	So , how
4686	0	a	Like this .
4687	0	a	But
4688	0	a	You have to put it on the
4689	0	a	Yeah .
4690	0	a	Or or this .
4691	0	a	And that the menu button is okay .
4692	0	a	Yeah but , has to be clear that you can use the arrows .
4693	0	a	Yeah , okay .
4694	0	a	Yes .
4695	0	a	, so the The icons on the arrows , as well , you mean .
4696	0	a	Yes .
4697	0	a	The second one .
4698	0	a	Yeah .
4699	0	a	, well that is something to think about .
4700	0	a	Okay .
4701	0	a	, maybe I will have something in my presentation .
4702	0	a	And you will see it .
4703	0	a	Okay .
4704	0	a	Okay .
4705	0	a	, well I do not I do not know if we have to discuss this already , or in the next meeting .
4706	1	a	But , as we have to to to design the the case and the whole remote control in our our our corporate company colours and the logo , I would recommend a yellow case .
4707	1	a	, round edges .
4708	1	a	The logo at the bottom .
4709	1	a	And , well maybe each each set of buttons has has his own colour .
4710	0	a	So , it is good .
4711	0	a	, recognisable .
4712	0	a	K
4713	0	a	so , I think .
4714	0	a	Not too much colours .
4715	0	a	, no .
4716	0	a	Not too much .
4717	0	a	But
4718	0	a	No , no , no .
4719	0	a	No , it is not flower power .
4720	0	a	But this has to be has to be trendy
4721	0	a	and and
4722	1	a	, yeah so good good icons on the buttons , and and big buttons is my personal opinion .
4723	0	a	S
4724	0	a	okay .
4725	0	a	Okay .
4726	0	a	That was that .
4727	0	a	Thank you .
4728	1	a	So , you are next .
4729	1	a	I am next , okay .
4730	0	a	Yes .
4731	0	a	No .
4732	0	a	Here we go .
4733	1	a	, at first we will I will f say something about what younger people want ,
4734	0	a	our group w w we want to sell our remote controls to .
4735	0	a	Okay .
4736	1	a	And then , I will discuss what my opinion is about the costs , about what battery is in it , what kind of buttons also .
4737	0	a	First , the younger people , they want like soft mat materials and primary colours .
4738	0	a	Like , totally yellow , totally red .
4739	0	a	, so it is visible .
4740	0	a	, the shapes are curved and round , like you also said .
4741	1	a	Maybe it is nice to get a remote control not like all the other ones , straight and flat and long .
4742	1	a	But to give him the shape of your hand , so you it is easier to use or something like that .
4743	0	a	But that is just an idea .
4744	1	a	And then , I will have to discuss about the costs of all the things for the remote control .
4745	0	a	The battery , there are few options .
4746	1	a	, I think the best option is to use the basic battery .
4747	0	a	So , everybody can buy it at the at the supermarket .
4748	1	a	Or use a k kinetic battery like within a watch .
4749	0	a	When you shake it a few times , it it is loaded .
4750	1	a	, the the form of the remote control , I think it is also nice have it curved .
4751	1	a	And maybe like it is hand shaped .
4752	0	a	, so you take it here in your hand and here are the buttons .
4753	1	a	material , you use plastic .
4754	1	a	Hard plastic
4755	0	a	because it wo not have to burst like in the in one time .
4756	1	a	And also rubber
4757	0	a	because the younger people like that , what we see in the research .
4758	0	a	the push buttons .
4759	0	a	We have one new thing discovered .
4760	0	a	It is a scroll push thing like a mouse .
4761	0	a	Maybe it is easy to use for the channels .
4762	0	a	When you want to go m move up , you just scroll up and click on the button , if you want to see the next , if you want to see that channel .
4763	0	a	And also for the mouse , for the volume , it is also easy to use .
4764	0	a	Just scroll a bit up , scroll a bit down .
4765	0	a	And that is also easy just w when you have a thing like this , and you get it here .
4766	0	a	You can do it with your thumb .
4767	0	a	And with your l left hand you can push the buttons if you push channel one , you can see channel one .
4768	0	a	The electrics with a scroll push button , we must use regular chips .
4769	0	a	There are also simple chips .
4770	0	a	They are cheaper .
4771	0	a	, but then we have just a basic remote control , and I think there are a lot of those things , and people wo not buy it any more .
4772	0	a	They have seen enough of it .
4773	0	a	And you have also advanced chips .
4774	0	a	But that is with the LCD screen .
4775	0	a	And the costs will increase a lot more .
4776	0	a	And I think our budget is too low to use and an LCD , and the chip who is more expensive .
4777	1	a	And maybe it is also then thoughtful if we
4778	1	a	u use as different kind of shapes for the for remote control , that we then use the primary colours .
4779	1	a	Like , you get a yellow remote control , red one , blue one , et cetera .
4780	0	a	You have any more questions about this ?
4781	1	a	I think the main thing is we look at the costs .
4782	0	a	Yep .
4783	1	a	And not too basic , not a basic remote control , who everybody already has .
4784	0	a	Yeah .
4785	0	a	But , thi i
4786	0	a	This is with an LCD ?
4787	0	a	No ,
4788	0	a	not .
4789	0	a	Not with an LCD .
4790	0	a	No , is not .
4791	0	a	No .
4792	0	a	But the LCD is easy when you use the scroll buttons .
4793	0	a	Then you can scroll , you see what number , and then you push .
4794	0	a	Yeah .
4795	0	a	But then , what I say , the costs will get a lot higher .
4796	0	a	But then it is not easy to use scroll wheel .
4797	0	a	Th then you will see it on the television .
4798	0	a	If you do not
4799	0	a	, yes .
4800	0	a	But then .
4801	0	a	Yeah , then you go one down one up .
4802	0	a	When you scroll .
4803	0	a	Yeah
4804	0	a	but l when you see a menu on the television , it is like you see one to twenty
4805	0	a	, you go s scroll up , and push number tw twenty .
4806	0	a	Yeah
4807	0	a	but like we said before , it has to be used on every television .
4808	0	a	So you may not be
4809	0	a	No .
4810	0	a	The television must do that .
4811	0	a	So
4812	0	a	Yeah
4813	0	a	but young people have to have all their room .
4814	0	a	Yeah , I think the younger people will have newer televisions , which can provide our remote control .
4815	0	a	And mostly they are smaller .
4816	0	a	Yes .
4817	0	a	So
4818	0	a	Most the times that are not advanced televisions .
4819	0	a	But that wo not be a problem .
4820	0	a	I think .
4821	0	a	No ,
4822	0	a	but then we will get to the regular remote controls .
4823	0	a	And I think , what I said , everybody has them has them already .
4824	0	a	And they go to a supermarket and buy them for two Euros .
4825	0	a	, and ge and get the most cheapest thing .
4826	1	a	And I think we must look further to to devel d develop something news .
4827	0	a	Okay .
4828	0	a	, can you give an indication in b in the cost difference between the chip with LCD or without ?
4829	0	a	Cause it
4830	0	a	I think if we have an LCD , it will also sell a lot better .
4831	0	a	I got it on my screen and it was higher .
4832	0	a	But I do not know how much higher .
4833	0	a	That is important .
4834	0	a	That is true .
4835	0	a	And that might bring back the costs
4836	0	a	Huh .
4837	0	a	But then we will
4838	1	a	I think we must discuss who what will be better .
4839	1	a	If we have a better shape of the remote control , or better options on it .
4840	0	a	With a scroll menu , a w scroll thing , and a LCD .
4841	0	a	And then a flat remote control .
4842	0	a	Or , a more hand shaped remote control , with scroll , without LCD .
4843	0	a	Yeah .
4844	1	a	Maybe you can look how how much it is for the LCD .
4845	1	a	I can look on my
4846	0	a	Note that the push button requires a simple chip chip .
4847	0	a	It is very important .
4848	0	a	A scroll wheel requires minimally a regular chip , which is a higher price range .
4849	0	a	The display requires a advanced chip , which is which in turn is more expensive than the regular chip .
4850	0	a	Yeah , more expensive .
4851	0	a	But how much ?
4852	0	a	Oh .
4853	0	a	Does not say .
4854	0	a	Okay .
4855	0	a	That is from my manufacturing division .
4856	0	a	Okay .
4857	0	a	Kay .
4858	0	a	Well , thank you .
4859	0	a	My turn ?
4860	0	a	Yes ?
4861	1	a	Changing covers .
4862	0	a	Next .
4863	0	a	So So Yeah .
4864	0	a	So , my presentation is about trend watching .
4865	0	a	, I did some trend watching .
4866	0	a	It is very important to keep up with latest trends .
4867	0	a	Cause if you do not , you wo not sell .
4868	0	a	So , well how we did do that ? ,
4869	0	a	well we made an investigation of the market , by Trendwatchers .
4870	0	a	They watch in cities like Paris and Milan .
4871	0	a	Of course , well known for their trend trends .
4872	0	a	And well , what did you find ?
4873	0	a	, we have two groups , young and trendy , and the old and rich .
4874	0	a	Well th and the young and trendy , they they starting to like fruit and vegetables as a theme for n clothes , shoes , and also products .
4875	0	a	And , material ?
4876	0	a	That should feel have a spongy feeling .
4877	0	a	And to get a feeling for what it is , here is an image of it .
4878	0	a	Then the old and rich .
4879	0	a	They like dark colours , and simple , recognisable shapes .
4880	0	a	And , they also like familiar material , especially wood .
4881	0	a	Now , another picture .
4882	0	a	To get a feeling for this .
4883	0	a	Well , then already come to my personal preferences .
4884	0	a	We aim at the younger market .
4885	1	a	So , we should also be look at their trends .
4886	0	a	However , with trends it is always if there is it is now .
4887	0	a	It it it might last one year , and next year it be can be totally different .
4888	0	a	And I think we want to sell our product for longer than one year .
4889	1	a	So , we m must not just only look at what the trend is now ,
4890	0	a	as it might be totally different next year .
4891	0	a	So , that is one thing to keep in mind .
4892	0	a	Yeah .
4893	0	a	Any questions ?
4894	0	a	Yeah .
4895	0	a	Nope .
4896	0	a	No .
4897	0	a	No .
4898	0	a	It is clear .
4899	0	a	So now , it is
4900	0	a	, let is see .
4901	0	a	Now , w we have to decide
4902	1	a	Well , we have to decide on the concept .
4903	1	a	So , we have to look at Is next .
4904	1	a	Components and user interface concept .
4905	0	a	So
4906	1	a	Now , we have to make some concept .
4907	1	a	Maybe one of you can paint it on the board .
4908	0	a	First , user interface .
4909	0	a	, uh uh .
4910	0	a	How w how we how we make it ?
4911	1	a	Should not we first discuss about like what w we all
4912	0	a	Yeah , but if I paint with
4913	0	a	More like something
4914	0	a	M like
4915	0	a	Yeah I ca not dr I ca not draw it .
4916	0	a	Yes , a concept on Just
4917	0	a	Yeah ,
4918	1	a	but maybe we can paint it .
4919	1	a	, what do we want ?
4920	1	a	I will paint .
4921	1	a	Okay .
4922	0	a	Well
4923	1	a	Something like this ?
4924	1	a	Or
4925	1	a	Shapes or What do we need ?
4926	0	a	Yes , okay .
4927	0	a	, yes .
4928	1	a	Can make several concepts .
4929	0	a	What ?
4930	1	a	We have this , and we had the idea of an a more like sh in the shape of your hand .
4931	0	a	Okay .
4932	0	a	Yeah I
4933	0	a	I
4934	0	a	I yes .
4935	0	a	I have to .
4936	1	a	And you have to .
4937	0	a	Yeah .
4938	0	a	I am not a designer .
4939	0	a	It is more three D .
4940	0	a	Like , when you have a part here .
4941	0	a	This is the remote control .
4942	0	a	And then you have something like th this under it .
4943	0	a	So , it is easier to get it like this .
4944	0	a	Yeah .
4945	0	a	Yeah .
4946	0	a	It is like a gun .
4947	0	a	A g
4948	0	a	So , it has to be soft ?
4949	0	a	Okay .
4950	0	a	And it has to be soft , yeah .
4951	0	a	So , you can squeeze in it and
4952	0	a	Sorry ?
4953	0	a	Buttons on top of it .
4954	0	a	And , the buttons ?
4955	0	a	Buttons .
4956	0	a	And here .
4957	0	a	The scrolling .
4958	0	a	You can do it with your thumb .
4959	1	a	But but i that is the only scroll button on it then ?
4960	0	a	Yeah , okay .
4961	1	a	But now we use one scroll button and the other one is here .
4962	0	a	No , it wo not .
4963	1	a	One till zero till nine .
4964	1	a	But , well there one for the sound and one for the channels .
4965	0	a	But but how
4966	0	a	Yeah .
4967	0	a	Yeah .
4968	0	a	And the b
4969	0	a	Yeah ?
4970	1	a	Or two buttons .
4971	0	a	How
4972	0	a	Okay .
4973	0	a	And i if we go to
4974	0	a	But if we have a me
4975	0	a	Yeah .
4976	0	a	, two scroll wheels .
4977	0	a	If Kay c If we do
4978	0	a	If we use one , then we will have just a switch on it , and you will just switch it , and now it is the sound to switch back with the menu button .
4979	0	a	That is th that is more difficult .
4980	0	a	It is better in
4981	0	a	But if we do not have a LCD we do not have a menu .
4982	0	a	If we have a menu , how do we choose other options ?
4983	0	a	Yeah .
4984	0	a	And then you also can scroll scroll in it .
4985	0	a	Just not like all the other ones , with this thing , and here an arrow , here an arrow , here an arrow , here an arrow .
4986	0	a	Because , from h hundred remote controls , ninety nine have it .
4987	0	a	Yeah .
4988	0	a	, then we have it on the TV , the menu .
4989	0	a	Uh uh .
4990	0	a	Yeah , but again maybe th
4991	0	a	How do we know the TV can handle it ?
4992	0	a	You do not know .
4993	0	a	So , there is no menu .
4994	0	a	I do not know .
4995	0	a	It is like some sort of teletext option , but we do not have teletext .
4996	0	a	No .
4997	0	a	So you ca not use it .
4998	0	a	And if we put an LCD thing on it , then the costs will be much higher .
4999	0	a	Okay ,
5000	1	a	we make two concepts .
5001	1	a	One with LCD .
5002	1	a	One without LCD .
5003	0	a	Kay .
5004	0	a	But you all like this kind of thing .
5005	0	a	With the scroll button .
5006	0	a	Good concept .
5007	0	a	But
5008	0	a	That is one .
5009	1	a	And and this one has to be soft .
5010	0	a	Uh uh .
5011	1	a	And this has to be harder ,
5012	0	a	because when it falls , it mu mu must not burst .
5013	1	a	Or some kind of rubber around it .
5014	0	a	It is one .
5015	1	a	Two .
5016	1	a	Number two .
5017	1	a	And you can and you can make the the power button as a trigger .
5018	0	a	Like Just to Oh , like a
5019	0	a	Yeah .
5020	0	a	Yeah .
5021	0	a	Yeah .
5022	0	a	that is nice .
5023	0	a	Here .
5024	0	a	Trigger .
5025	0	a	No .
5026	0	a	But when you handle it , you put it on and off .
5027	0	a	It is not good to use .
5028	0	a	Yeah , but I will zap .
5029	0	a	Fuck .
5030	0	a	Out .
5031	0	a	No , it is not good .
5032	0	a	Yeah .
5033	1	a	Now , second concept .
5034	1	a	One with LCD , one without LCD .
5035	0	a	Then
5036	1	a	Paint it .
5037	0	a	Paint it ?
5038	1	a	With the scroll thing on , like this ?
5039	0	a	So ?
5040	1	a	Draw it .
5041	1	a	One with two scroll buttons and one with without .
5042	0	a	Yeah .
5043	1	a	, one with a with a menu , and one without a menu .
5044	1	a	And the one with with a menu has an LCD .
5045	0	a	Unbelievable .
5046	0	a	Do I have to do everything .
5047	0	a	Blank .
5048	0	a	You have
5049	0	a	Not so difficult .
5050	0	a	But if you put push the the menu button
5051	0	a	Yeah , wh what
5052	0	a	Yes , but you do not know which of the scroll buttons you have to choose .
5053	0	a	Yeah .
5054	0	a	, that is the menu .
5055	0	a	There for the LCD screen .
5056	0	a	You have to
5057	0	a	For the menu .
5058	0	a	Yeah .
5059	0	a	One that way .
5060	0	a	And one that way .
5061	0	a	So
5062	0	a	Then it depends on the cost .
5063	0	a	S On and off .
5064	0	a	But is it easy to use ?
5065	0	a	When you have it on your left side ,
5066	0	a	and
5067	1	a	Separate , more separate , h yeah .
5068	0	a	When it is not too big .
5069	0	a	Just like a a phone .
5070	1	a	M
5071	1	a	yeah , maybe it is better if the scroll wheels are
5072	0	a	more separate , yeah .
5073	0	a	Yes , okay .
5074	1	a	Like , you have the menu button in between
5075	0	a	Yeah .
5076	0	a	Yeah .
5077	1	a	On the left a scroll button , and on the right a scroll button .
5078	0	a	But would it be easy to use then ?
5079	0	a	If it is like you have a big
5080	0	a	I also think this concept is not what the young people were looking for .
5081	0	a	Very good .
5082	0	a	Is it better ?
5083	0	a	When you the menu , you have to go there there there there .
5084	0	a	They were like round curves ,
5085	0	a	different
5086	0	a	Okay , okay , okay .
5087	0	a	Yeah , okay .
5088	0	a	That is that is the outside .
5089	0	a	But now the
5090	1	a	First the buttons .
5091	0	a	Think we have we have now two buttons missing .
5092	0	a	The
5093	0	a	The mute button .
5094	0	a	Sorry ?
5095	0	a	Mute .
5096	0	a	We have two buttons missing .
5097	0	a	The mute button .
5098	0	a	And , the to to have to numbers
5099	0	a	Okay .
5100	0	a	And the other .
5101	0	a	Yeah .
5102	0	a	Not so difficult .
5103	0	a	But ,
5104	0	a	Okay .
5105	0	a	Personally , I think two scroll buttons are not easy to handle .
5106	1	a	But how do you want to solve it ?
5107	0	a	Yeah but on the menu that is not easy .
5108	1	a	With the switch button .
5109	0	a	Then you go down , you switch , you go into the right , you switch ,
5110	0	a	you go down .
5111	0	a	No
5112	0	a	like
5113	0	a	Oh , you mean like that .
5114	0	a	Yeah .
5115	1	a	, then you can also have like th
5116	0	a	Yeah , and joystick , I think .
5117	1	a	A joystick .
5118	0	a	Yeah .
5119	0	a	But is it
5120	0	a	Does that break , a joystick ?
5121	1	a	Or a small one just like in a laptop .
5122	0	a	Yeah like in a laptop , s s some sort of thing .
5123	1	a	A little bit bigger ,
5124	0	a	with easier thi
5125	0	a	I do not know .
5126	0	a	Mean , it is better .
5127	0	a	But how expensive it is ?
5128	0	a	Oh .
5129	0	a	Why do I pay you for ?
5130	0	a	, well
5131	1	a	Better ideas .
5132	1	a	Or no scroll things .
5133	1	a	Just a shape .
5134	0	a	And
5135	0	a	No , no .
5136	0	a	For the young peoples I think scroll button is good .
5137	0	a	It wo not work .
5138	0	a	Yeah .
5139	0	a	Uh huh .
5140	0	a	So
5141	1	a	Think we have to keep them .
5142	1	a	Or a remote control more like joystick .
5143	0	a	Yeah , but is it
5144	0	a	That is not expensive than Joystick is better .
5145	1	a	A small one .
5146	0	a	A small one like this , like a Nintendo k
5147	1	a	Playstation thing .
5148	0	a	No
5149	1	a	just like in a a laptop .
5150	1	a	Small , round .
5151	0	a	Then it is not so big .
5152	0	a	No , no , no .
5153	0	a	I mean the the shape of the remote control .
5154	0	a	Oh the sh
5155	0	a	Yeah ,
5156	0	a	but then you can
5157	0	a	Just like a Playstation thing .
5158	0	a	Yeah .
5159	0	a	So
5160	0	a	Maybe , if it is possible , it is not too expensive , I think a joystick is better .
5161	0	a	A small one .
5162	1	a	So , please look at it .
5163	0	a	No , that is okay ,
5164	0	a	I got
5165	0	a	they are not in details .
5166	0	a	And on the LCD , how much it costs ? , it costs extra ?
5167	0	a	Yeah .
5168	0	a	It is more expensive or less expensive , huh ?
5169	1	a	Then I have to come with it .
5170	0	a	Yeah we I think you get it .
5171	1	a	So , after this meeting you have half an hour to fix it .
5172	0	a	Yes .
5173	0	a	I got my personal costs .
5174	0	a	I I do not I do not know the costs .
5175	0	a	Your problem .
5176	0	a	Not mine .
5177	0	a	Then I will make something up .
5178	0	a	Okay .
5179	1	a	So , do we have other concepts ?
5180	1	a	Then for the components , we use a normal battery .
5181	0	a	, yeah .
5182	0	a	Then it is Ch cheapest way , I think .
5183	1	a	Yeah , or the or the kinetic with normal battery .
5184	0	a	No , no kinetic .
5185	0	a	Yeah , I think it is , yeah ,
5186	0	a	more expensive .
5187	0	a	Kinetic is ch makes it more expensive .
5188	0	a	Yeah .
5189	1	a	So we use a normal battery .
5190	0	a	Yeah .
5191	0	a	Okay .
5192	0	a	Yes .
5193	0	a	Chip .
5194	0	a	Depends on the LCD .
5195	0	a	Depends on the scroll .
5196	0	a	Scroll .
5197	0	a	If we use a scroll , then we have the regular chip .
5198	0	a	If we do not use a scroll , then we can use the simple chip .
5199	0	a	And that is
5200	0	a	the most expensive .
5201	0	a	Yeah .
5202	0	a	And , we If you use the LCD , we have to
5203	0	a	Yes , okay .
5204	0	a	Yeah .
5205	0	a	So , depends on the LCD and the scroll .
5206	0	a	If we
5207	0	a	Yeah .
5208	0	a	Okay .
5209	0	a	If we
5210	0	a	No okay scroll wheel .
5211	0	a	So , I have this .
5212	0	a	So , it will be the advanced chip , or the regu or the regular chip .
5213	0	a	Okay .
5214	0	a	So , the shapes of the design depends on the LCD
5215	0	a	and
5216	1	a	But , it has to be small .
5217	0	a	I think .
5218	1	a	Or shall we just put it on the pistol thing ?
5219	1	a	And then just put also on LCD on it ?
5220	0	a	Just use your thumb .
5221	0	a	If you have pistol , it LCD is not easy .
5222	0	a	Y y
5223	0	a	Yeah
5224	0	a	but
5225	0	a	If you use a phone .
5226	0	a	If you
5227	0	a	Yeah .
5228	0	a	I use my thumb .
5229	0	a	k
5230	0	a	Yeah ,
5231	0	a	but but then you have it .
5232	0	a	Like , th if you have pistol , you have it so .
5233	0	a	Yeah .
5234	0	a	And the screen is
5235	0	a	Well , then you have to keep it this way to look at the screen .
5236	0	a	If you have a joystick on
5237	0	a	No ,
5238	0	a	if you have like an a ni a Playstation game controller .
5239	0	a	Yeah .
5240	0	a	And you move up , f forward , down , left .
5241	0	a	Then you have just , yeah , a little bit curved .
5242	0	a	It is not just straight .
5243	0	a	No .
5244	0	a	No , no .
5245	0	a	That is how we use it .
5246	0	a	, yeah , but
5247	0	a	Yeah .
5248	0	a	That is why they make joysticks like that , I think .
5249	0	a	Yeah , but then you look forward .
5250	0	a	And then you can y
5251	0	a	N
5252	0	a	well , if you have to look at it .
5253	0	a	Yeah ?
5254	0	a	Kay .
5255	0	a	If you
5256	0	a	If we have then something standing here , with the LCD .
5257	0	a	Here is our designer .
5258	0	a	Yeah .
5259	0	a	Then it goes like this .
5260	0	a	Yeah , why not .
5261	0	a	If th n well
5262	0	a	Yes , of course .
5263	0	a	It is for the younger people .
5264	0	a	It is something new .
5265	0	a	It is
5266	1	a	Or you can turn it inside .
5267	0	a	That is good good .
5268	0	a	But the ,
5269	0	a	it may not break .
5270	1	a	Now we put rubber around it .
5271	0	a	Okay .
5272	0	a	If that is possible .
5273	0	a	, Yeah .
5274	1	a	Hard plastic , the shape , and around it hard around it rubber .
5275	1	a	And the the hand shape is also rubber .
5276	0	a	Okay .
5277	0	a	I ca not see the .
5278	0	a	But , the easy of
5279	0	a	, th the ease of use was not the most important aspect of it .
5280	0	a	But that is
5281	0	a	No , that is true .
5282	0	a	Huh .
5283	0	a	, for us it is about to sell it .
5284	0	a	One .
5285	0	a	Yeah of course .
5286	0	a	This is something new .
5287	0	a	Okay .
5288	0	a	Then this is the design .
5289	0	a	And the buttons are on the next page .
5290	0	a	So , depends on the cost .
5291	0	a	So ,
5292	0	a	we have one minute .
5293	0	a	Costs are okay .
5294	0	a	I think .
5295	0	a	No .
5296	0	a	No .
5297	0	a	You have more .
5298	0	a	More .
5299	0	a	Seven .
5300	0	a	You have still ten .
5301	0	a	Next meeting .
5302	0	a	Thirty minutes .
5303	1	a	So hurry up .
5304	0	a	Oh , that is us together .
5305	1	a	You two stay here .
5306	1	a	Paint it .
5307	0	a	Okay .
5308	0	a	Now you have to .
5309	0	a	So
5310	0	a	I think it is clear .
5311	1	a	Check your mail .
5312	0	a	So
5313	0	a	It has to be ready in the next meeting .
5314	0	a	Yeah .
5315	0	a	Yes .
5316	0	a	So
5317	0	a	Next meeting is called the detailed design .
5318	0	a	What ?
5319	0	a	Okay .
5320	0	a	So
5321	0	a	Everyth everything has to be ready .
5322	0	a	Okay .
5323	0	a	Kay .
5324	0	a	 
5325	0	a	Okay .
5326	0	a	So , now , last time .
5327	1	a	Can you push the button ?
5328	1	a	One time please .
5329	0	a	So
5330	0	a	I am still the secretary .
5331	1	a	Now , I ask you to presentate the prototype .
5332	1	a	One of your you two .
5333	0	a	I do not care .
5334	0	a	Oh this , you mean ?
5335	0	a	Yes , well
5336	0	a	this is it .
5337	0	a	Huh ?
5338	0	a	Big .
5339	0	a	Yes .
5340	0	a	The prototype .
5341	0	a	This is it .
5342	0	a	Well , thank you .
5343	0	a	, now
5344	0	a	Yes .
5345	0	a	It is it is it is yellow .
5346	0	a	And , this is rubber .
5347	0	a	And and and this too .
5348	0	a	The
5349	0	a	the sides .
5350	0	a	And the rest is hard plastic .
5351	0	a	And We we had some
5352	0	a	We had a new idea that that this can can be turned inside .
5353	0	a	And then it covers the these buttons until here or something .
5354	0	a	Okay .
5355	0	a	Yes .
5356	0	a	And then you can still use the the power button and the mute and the the joystick .
5357	0	a	So , you can still operate all the things .
5358	0	a	Because you do not always use the menu .
5359	0	a	And then it can break .
5360	0	a	Okay .
5361	0	a	And the buttons ?
5362	0	a	And the joystick is for the volume and the channels .
5363	0	a	, well
5364	0	a	Big buttons .
5365	0	a	And everything is blue , except the power button .
5366	0	a	And the mute .
5367	0	a	Of
5368	0	a	yeah , and the mute and the the other button .
5369	0	a	Yeah .
5370	0	a	Channel higher channel button .
5371	0	a	Yeah .
5372	0	a	, yes .
5373	0	a	Yes .
5374	0	a	Yes ,
5375	0	a	that is
5376	0	a	Very obvious .
5377	0	a	Up is channel up .
5378	0	a	Down is channel down .
5379	0	a	To the right is volume up .
5380	0	a	To the left is volume down .
5381	0	a	Yeah .
5382	0	a	Okay , so if joystick and LCD .
5383	0	a	What is the RR
5384	0	a	d
5385	0	a	Okay .
5386	0	a	The RR ?
5387	1	a	I will get it .
5388	0	a	RR is the l the the the the company logo .
5389	0	a	Very good .
5390	0	a	So , we have
5391	0	a	So , what they say on the side is put fashion there .
5392	0	a	That is on the rub rubber part .
5393	0	a	, yes .
5394	0	a	Yes .
5395	0	a	That is about here .
5396	0	a	Yes .
5397	0	a	It is good .
5398	0	a	Oh .
5399	0	a	So , that is it .
5400	0	a	Yeah ?
5401	0	a	Alright .
5402	0	a	That is prototype .
5403	0	a	Now , the finance .
5404	0	a	We do not know if it is th it if it is okay .
5405	1	a	So , I am going to look .
5406	0	a	Do we
5407	0	a	Do we change the Do we change the the order ?
5408	0	a	Or are we going to ev evaluate it first ?
5409	0	a	Okay .
5410	0	a	We have
5411	0	a	Sorry ?
5412	0	a	Finance is
5413	0	a	Yeah
5414	0	a	it is
5415	0	a	No ,
5416	0	a	first
5417	0	a	Yes .
5418	0	a	We have to evaluate the product yet .
5419	0	a	Sorry .
5420	0	a	That is
5421	0	a	That can be none .
5422	1	a	, we going to do the evaluation now , together .
5423	1	a	But I have a introduction how it works .
5424	0	a	So , it will come up .
5425	0	a	Uh oh .
5426	0	a	Okay .
5427	0	a	, yeah .
5428	0	a	Well , we ,
5429	0	a	I have thinked a few evaluation criterias , based on our marketing strategy , on the latest trends , on user preferences .
5430	0	a	, we have a seven point scale from true , as well .
5431	0	a	To false , seven ?
5432	0	a	And on base of each c criteria , we need to give a rating .
5433	0	a	We can
5434	0	a	Well , it look like this .
5435	0	a	But we going to do it here , they said .
5436	0	a	So , you hope found out how to do it with a Word document .
5437	0	a	Yeah .
5438	0	a	Okay , yeah .
5439	0	a	Yeah .
5440	0	a	, well we have the Word document
5441	0	a	You
5442	0	a	So we open up that blank here .
5443	0	a	Criteria .
5444	0	a	Think I can
5445	0	a	, what this just an example .
5446	0	a	So , this not very important .
5447	1	a	But , if I can get a number in here .
5448	0	a	No , it is okay .
5449	0	a	Well , we ca not do that .
5450	0	a	Oh , it is okay .
5451	0	a	, so you have to think of it as the remote control is techno technologically innovative .
5452	1	a	, and then we have to agree on the rating together .
5453	1	a	And in the end , we will c count an average of all rating .
5454	0	a	The first on each item .
5455	0	a	What do you think ?
5456	0	a	Yeah .
5457	0	a	Yeah , I think it is , well technologically using , it is not it does not contain many new features .
5458	0	a	Only the LCD .
5459	0	a	So , it
5460	0	a	, I think I will give it a yeah
5461	0	a	, yeah ,
5462	0	a	yeah , a four .
5463	0	a	I think the scroll button is something also new .
5464	0	a	What not anoth ,
5465	0	a	not a lot of a lot of remote controls have .
5466	0	a	I think technologically I will give it an seven .
5467	0	a	Si six six .
5468	0	a	Sorry , six .
5469	0	a	So now i I think you see it its statement .
5470	0	a	And you true or false .
5471	0	a	Oh , true or false .
5472	0	a	Oh , I will I will give it a t a two .
5473	0	a	And true is one .
5474	0	a	So , yeah .
5475	0	a	Yeah .
5476	0	a	Two .
5477	0	a	Sorry .
5478	0	a	You ?
5479	0	a	Me too .
5480	0	a	Three .
5481	0	a	So it is a three .
5482	0	a	Kay .
5483	0	a	, well
5484	0	a	It is a one .
5485	0	a	The first item .
5486	0	a	So , okay the second item .
5487	0	a	, this product is for all sorts of customers .
5488	0	a	, four .
5489	0	a	Well , it is a statement which I disagree with , because we really aim at at young market
5490	0	a	and I think the way it looked c totally in yellow , it is not really aimed for all customers .
5491	0	a	It does not look like that .
5492	0	a	So it is a
5493	0	a	Yes , it is for the younger g group .
5494	0	a	That is a six .
5495	0	a	Five .
5496	0	a	Yeah , but it is it is
5497	0	a	Yeah .
5498	0	a	So it is half half of the people .
5499	0	a	So I think it is four .
5500	0	a	I mean it still has l large buttons and not m many buttons .
5501	0	a	So I mean , the colours are for young people ,
5502	0	a	but older
5503	0	a	Yeah .
5504	0	a	No .
5505	0	a	Yes .
5506	0	a	So , I think it is four .
5507	1	a	Maybe version three point O has other colours .
5508	0	a	Yeah .
5509	0	a	Maybe .
5510	0	a	Okay .
5511	0	a	Give it a four .
5512	0	a	Four .
5513	0	a	Four .
5514	0	a	Yep .
5515	0	a	, okay .
5516	0	a	We put the fashion in electronics .
5517	0	a	That is the motto of our company .
5518	0	a	Yeah , well do we do this with this product ?
5519	0	a	I
5520	0	a	Yeah .
5521	0	a	I think if we do this , as it is c it is really orientates on the design .
5522	0	a	, so I would give it a two .
5523	0	a	Me too a two , because only the battery is not techin technologically high standard .
5524	0	a	But the rest of it is .
5525	0	a	So , I think a two .
5526	0	a	Yes .
5527	0	a	Two .
5528	0	a	Two .
5529	0	a	, I say a five .
5530	0	a	It is not fashion , it is new .
5531	0	a	It must be a fashion .
5532	0	a	But it is not .
5533	0	a	It
5534	0	a	it will be fashion .
5535	0	a	Yes .
5536	1	a	It w If it is not a fashion we can put it in it .
5537	0	a	So , it must be a fashion .
5538	0	a	I think it is a five .
5539	0	a	Okay .
5540	1	a	Then make it th three .
5541	0	a	Okay .
5542	0	a	Yes , I will think of that too .
5543	0	a	No .
5544	0	a	Kay .
5545	0	a	Oh .
5546	0	a	Three is okay .
5547	0	a	Yeah , agree ?
5548	0	a	A three .
5549	0	a	I use my feet though .
5550	0	a	Oh , we will wait outside .
5551	0	a	Okay .
5552	0	a	Yeah okay .
5553	0	a	The next element is the product looks good .
5554	0	a	Well personally , I do not prefer a remote control that is fully in yellow .
5555	0	a	So , I would give this a five .
5556	0	a	I give it a one .
5557	0	a	Yes , a one .
5558	0	a	I like it .
5559	0	a	Well , I say three .
5560	0	a	So , counting then is two and a half .
5561	0	a	We have to do our
5562	0	a	Two or three ?
5563	0	a	Two .
5564	0	a	Say two .
5565	0	a	Okay , two .
5566	0	a	Two .
5567	0	a	Okay .
5568	1	a	So , well we going to do the next part .
5569	0	a	, yep .
5570	0	a	, the next statement .
5571	0	a	It has not too much buttons .
5572	0	a	, yeah ,
5573	0	a	I I have said is not because a low number is better .
5574	1	a	And in the end we calculate an average .
5575	0	a	So , that is why it is a negative in it .
5576	0	a	, well this one of our aims not have too much buttons .
5577	0	a	So , did we do that ?
5578	0	a	Well , if we go to this fashion , I We still have caused a lot of buttons for the numbers .
5579	0	a	But you can you can go for that .
5580	0	a	And that way , you do not have a lot of buttons over .
5581	0	a	So , I would give this a two .
5582	0	a	One .
5583	0	a	You ?
5584	0	a	Me too .
5585	0	a	One .
5586	0	a	One .
5587	0	a	One .
5588	0	a	, but where where is the ?
5589	0	a	So
5590	0	a	Yeah , did we implement the sound ?
5591	0	a	Yeah .
5592	0	a	Next , six .
5593	0	a	It does not get lost easily .
5594	0	a	Just a small thing .
5595	0	a	Yes .
5596	0	a	No , we did not .
5597	0	a	Yeah , but
5598	0	a	Yeah .
5599	0	a	So , but can it get lost if it is such a thing ?
5600	0	a	I do not think so .
5601	0	a	Yellow .
5602	0	a	Looks like a pistol .
5603	0	a	Yes .
5604	0	a	Not a not a normal shapes .
5605	0	a	It wo not get between the pillows on the couch .
5606	0	a	So
5607	0	a	No .
5608	0	a	It wo not get lost .
5609	0	a	So
5610	0	a	A one ?
5611	0	a	Okay , a one .
5612	0	a	Yeah , o one .
5613	0	a	It wo not .
5614	0	a	Yeah .
5615	0	a	One .
5616	0	a	Next .
5617	0	a	Okay , well we aimed for the younger market .
5618	0	a	yeah , did we achieve that .
5619	0	a	I think with the way it looks and it is designed , I will give it a two .
5620	0	a	Yeah me
5621	0	a	That was our target .
5622	0	a	Yeah .
5623	0	a	Me too .
5624	0	a	Two .
5625	0	a	Two .
5626	0	a	Yeah .
5627	0	a	Yeah ?
5628	0	a	Yeah .
5629	0	a	Yep .
5630	0	a	Right .
5631	0	a	There is a fancy look and feel .
5632	0	a	, yes .
5633	0	a	That that was , yeah , one of the most important things that Trendwatch said .
5634	0	a	I did not say it in my presentation .
5635	0	a	But ,
5636	0	a	well does it have that ?
5637	0	a	I would say yes .
5638	0	a	So
5639	0	a	Well , let is also give this a two .
5640	0	a	T
5641	0	a	Yeah .
5642	0	a	I gave this a one because of the rubber .
5643	0	a	It feels soft .
5644	0	a	, it looks like a l b , a bit like a joystick .
5645	0	a	It is Yeah .
5646	0	a	Yeah , f very fancy trendy .
5647	0	a	Okay .
5648	0	a	Yes , a one .
5649	0	a	I say a two .
5650	0	a	It is a a bit personal .
5651	0	a	If it is fancy .
5652	0	a	So I think s two is better .
5653	0	a	Yeah , okay .
5654	0	a	Okay .
5655	0	a	Two is okay .
5656	0	a	Two .
5657	0	a	And , then the last one I could think of ,
5658	0	a	it goes with the latest trends .
5659	0	a	No , it is new .
5660	0	a	Innovation .
5661	0	a	If we looked at the latest trends for the younger people , and they ate fruit and vegetables ,
5662	0	a	well it has a a nice colour , well compared to food
5663	0	a	but we did not
5664	0	a	We did not paint any fruit and vegetable on it for something like that .
5665	0	a	Oh .
5666	0	a	So , I would did not give this a one or two .
5667	0	a	I
5668	0	a	We will go for a three .
5669	0	a	I go for two because the the shapes are still round .
5670	0	a	, the latest trends are soft things , you know , like I said in my presentation .
5671	0	a	Yes .
5672	0	a	But the the colours are basic , like yellow , red , blue .
5673	0	a	Something what also younger people want .
5674	0	a	It is also a trend , so I will give it a two .
5675	0	a	Okay .
5676	0	a	, three .
5677	0	a	Me too .
5678	0	a	Three .
5679	0	a	A three .
5680	0	a	Yeah .
5681	0	a	Okay .
5682	1	a	So , come back to the presentation now .
5683	0	a	So , we find yourself there ,
5684	1	a	and now we have to calculate an average rating .
5685	1	a	So , we will do that .
5686	0	a	Effort is three , ten and twelve .
5687	0	a	Yes .
5688	0	a	Thirty , forty , fifty , .
5689	0	a	Twenty one .
5690	0	a	So , it is two and three nine two and one third .
5691	0	a	By nine .
5692	0	a	Two .
5693	0	a	Yeah .
5694	0	a	, okay .
5695	0	a	Two .

5725	0	a	We have a battery .
5726	0	a	One battery .

5728	0	a	Okay , one battery .
5729	0	a	Electronics .
5730	0	a	Advanced chip .
5731	0	a	Expensive .
5732	0	a	Yeah
5733	0	a	it is the most advanced .
5734	0	a	Chip on print .
5735	0	a	We have that one .

5737	0	a	We have the simple , regular and advanced .
5738	0	a	Advanced .
5739	0	a	We have the adva advanced .
5740	0	a	Kay , so uncurved or flat .
5741	0	a	Nope .
5742	0	a	Single curved or double curved ?
5743	0	a	We have double curved .
5744	0	a	So
5745	0	a	Then we have plastic , wood , rubber .
5746	0	a	we have half rubber , half plastic .
5747	0	a	, yes .
5748	0	a	No titanium .
5749	0	a	Special colour .
5750	0	a	Yes , yellow .
5751	0	a	Yeah .
5752	0	a	, yellow .
5753	0	a	, yeah .
5754	0	a	Interface , push button .
5755	0	a	Scroll wheel , integrated scroll wheel push push button , or LCD display .
5756	0	a	So , we have the LCD
5757	0	a	We have two scroll wheels ?
5758	0	a	Or one ?
5759	0	a	And it is not really a s
5760	0	a	Yeah , it is this one .
5761	0	a	One .
5762	0	a	One .
5763	0	a	Joystick thing .
5764	0	a	Now , button supplement .
5765	0	a	Special colour .
5766	0	a	We already
5767	0	a	, that is the from the for the buttons .
5768	0	a	The buttons are regular colour .
5769	0	a	, yeah .
5770	0	a	So , then then then then then then then Then
5771	0	a	, no .
5772	0	a	We are not going to make it .
5773	0	a	It is too expensive .
5774	0	a	Yeah .
5775	0	a	Wh
5776	0	a	What what are the costs ?
5777	0	a	Fifteen .
5778	1	a	So , we have to change something .
5779	0	a	Fifteen Euros .
5780	0	a	Yeah , well when we lose one scroll wheel , it is okay .
5781	0	a	Cause we ca not lose the battery .
5782	0	a	We ca not lose the advanced chip .
5783	0	a	We ca not lose the double curve .
5784	0	a	We have rubber , special colour .
5785	0	a	We would have n
5786	0	a	For a remote control .
5787	0	a	A special colour .
5788	0	a	, I do not think it is a very special colour .
5789	0	a	Oh , no , we
5790	0	a	No , it is
5791	0	a	Sorry ?
5792	0	a	, then we lose two Euros .
5793	0	a	Yellow ?
5794	0	a	, is it a special colour ?
5795	0	a	What ?
5796	0	a	Yeah .
5797	0	a	I have
5798	0	a	For a remote control , I think it is .
5799	1	a	If we would have normal buttons instead of the joystick .
5800	1	a	For up down left right .
5801	0	a	Then we have thirteen Euros .
5802	0	a	Half a Euro too much .
5803	0	a	Exactly the special colours .
5804	1	a	And what if we use only one sort of just only plastic or only rubber ?
5805	0	a	One Euro discount .
5806	0	a	So
5807	0	a	That is one Euro .
5808	0	a	So , I do not think that is good .
5809	1	a	I think we have to keep the LCD .
5810	0	a	If
5811	0	a	Yes .
5812	1	a	If we change the joyst the joystick thing into a button up , button down , button right , button left .
5813	0	a	Then it is only thirteen Euros .
5814	1	a	And then we will lose fifty cent in what ?
5815	0	a	uh uh .
5816	0	a	So yeah .
5817	0	a	Yeah .
5818	0	a	Then you have
5819	1	a	Or you have to cut this off .
5820	0	a	Then it is not good anymore .
5821	0	a	No .
5822	0	a	So , wait .
5823	1	a	Okay .
5824	1	a	I will have a look .
5825	0	a	We
5826	0	a	Yellow rubber .
5827	1	a	And if you say it is just a r normal colour it is a normal colour ,
5828	0	a	wh
5829	0	a	No one will see it .
5830	0	a	Yeah , normal .
5831	1	a	Normal colour , and the the joystick away , and put the button up , button down , right , left .
5832	0	a	One minute , please .
5833	0	a	And it is twelve Euros , I think .
5834	0	a	Is it maximum .
5835	0	a	Yeah , it is normal colour .
5836	0	a	But if you lose the joystick , it is still an advanced chip ?
5837	0	a	Or it is then a regular ?
5838	0	a	So , the advanced is for the LCD and the regular for the joystick .
5839	0	a	No .
5840	0	a	, no , no , no .
5841	0	a	Oh , wait wait wait .
5842	0	a	The advanced chip was for the LCD
5843	0	a	was not it ?
5844	0	a	If If we have the n no buttons
5845	0	a	If we have we have not a joystick but buttons , we would have , we have thirteen Euros ?
5846	1	a	And then we move the the colour .
5847	0	a	Yeah .
5848	0	a	Oh yeah .
5849	0	a	Oh yeah .
5850	0	a	Yeah .
5851	0	a	Yeah ,
5852	0	a	yeah .
5853	1	a	And what if we lose the LCD ?
5854	0	a	Yeah , regular chip .
5855	0	a	If we lose the LCD , then we have an regular chip and no LCD .
5856	0	a	But
5857	0	a	Is it a good design ?
5858	0	a	, yes .
5859	0	a	, yeah .
5860	0	a	Then you will have to m see the menu on the television .
5861	0	a	And you do not have the LCD .
5862	0	a	So , the TVs has to have to be up to date .
5863	0	a	Yeah .
5864	1	a	What will that be ?
5865	0	a	Yeah .
5866	0	a	Yeah .
5867	0	a	Then it is okay .
5868	0	a	Huh .
5869	0	a	No knew that .
5870	1	a	Okay , so no joystick .
5871	0	a	Oh no ,
5872	0	a	but we then we get push buttons from half a Euro .
5873	0	a	Yeah ,
5874	0	a	then it is twelve Euro fifty , then it is okay .
5875	0	a	, yes , yes , yes , yes .
5876	0	a	No joystick .
5877	0	a	Push buttons .
5878	0	a	No special colour .
5879	0	a	Twelve and a half Euros .
5880	0	a	Then it is okay .
5881	1	a	So , we have to change that a little bit .
5882	0	a	And you cannot use the red and green button .
5883	0	a	Because if you give them a s colour , you have to pay point two Euros .
5884	0	a	Okay .
5885	0	a	All the same
5886	0	a	, yeah .
5887	0	a	So , all the buttons has to have to be the same colour .
5888	0	a	Yes .
5889	1	a	But then the print on it will g change it .
5890	1	a	Make it for everybody to see what button it is .
5891	0	a	l How you call it ?
5892	0	a	Recognisable
5893	0	a	, yeah .
5894	0	a	Recognisable .
5895	0	a	Like what
5896	0	a	Yeah .
5897	0	a	Yes .
5898	0	a	, yeah .
5899	0	a	So So Well
5900	1	a	Now we have to change that ,
5901	0	a	but that is okay .
5902	0	a	Yeah ?
5903	0	a	Okay .
5904	0	a	Okay .
5905	0	a	Rubber .
5906	0	a	What is the normal colour ?
5907	0	a	So And
5908	0	a	Where is ?
5909	0	a	Yeah .
5910	0	a	Oh , well that is clear .
5911	0	a	So , now it is
5912	0	a	Yeah .
5913	1	a	And the joystick away .
5914	1	a	And its buttons .
5915	0	a	It is .
5916	0	a	But then it will be just that ones .
5917	0	a	Yeah .
5918	0	a	Now it is
5919	0	a	Very good .
5920	0	a	still , he waited at the
5921	0	a	No .
5922	0	a	Now , project eva evaluation .
5923	0	a	Well
5924	0	a	What do you think of it ?
5925	0	a	About the project .
5926	0	a	About the
5927	0	a	process .
5928	0	a	Project .
5929	0	a	Went good .
5930	0	a	I think the creativity was good enough .
5931	0	a	We have a gun instead of a remote control .
5932	0	a	leadership .
5933	0	a	Yeah , you were the project project manager , and had the final vote .
5934	0	a	So yeah that was clear .
5935	0	a	Team work okay .
5936	0	a	Everybody has something to say about it .
5937	0	a	And no ,
5938	0	a	o only the the drawing was very difficult .
5939	0	a	But , nah .
5940	0	a	New ideas found .
5941	0	a	Nope .
5942	0	a	Okay .
5943	0	a	And you .
5944	0	a	Yeah , well the same .
5945	0	a	I I espe
5946	0	a	I especially liked the the means , the the SMARTboard
5947	0	a	and
5948	0	a	Yeah , it
5949	0	a	It brings up new ideas when you work with with it .
5950	0	a	Okay .
5951	0	a	Yeah .
5952	1	a	Yeah , I think you have to compare it to if you would have a normal normal project without laptops and without these devices .
5953	0	a	I think
5954	0	a	Well , the laptops if you have them out front of you , you sometimes looking at that instead of the presentation .
5955	0	a	, well the draw board , well you can draw things .
5956	0	a	But it not really going very convenient .
5957	0	a	, maybe it will be easier if you have a smaller monitor and you would also see there .
5958	0	a	And with a normal mouse .
5959	0	a	, and the project .
5960	0	a	Yeah , I agree on what was said mainly .
5961	0	a	, yeah
5962	0	a	but you always have that some people are talking more than others .
5963	0	a	And maybe is then the task of the the project manager to also ask more to the people less talking .
5964	0	a	To tell their opinion .
5965	0	a	Okay .
5966	0	a	Well , what do I have to say .
5967	0	a	I think it was good .
5968	0	a	Not too many discussions .
5969	0	a	No .
5970	0	a	So , it is good for the speed .
5971	0	a	No .
5972	0	a	Yep .
5973	0	a	So , I think we are ready .
5974	0	a	Yeah .

6019	0	a	Okay .
6020	0	a	Okay .
6021	0	a	we are here to develop a new product .
6022	0	a	I am sure you have had a mail from our account manager about it .
6023	0	a	and
6024	0	a	this is the first meeting to to generate some some ideas about it .
6025	0	a	you are here in a specific role .
6026	0	a	Ruud is here as the Marketing Expert , Roo is here as the User Interface Designer and Sebastian is here in the role of Industrial Designer .
6027	0	a	Is that correct ?
6028	0	a	Okay .
6029	0	a	That is correct .
6030	1	a	we are going to do a little tool training for the tools we are going to use during the meetings we are going to have here .
6031	1	a	then I will tell you a little bit about my idea of the project plan ,
6032	1	a	and we will have a discussion .
6033	0	a	this meeting should take no more than twenty five minutes , so we should keep that in mind .
6034	0	a	Alright .
6035	0	a	Okay .
6036	0	a	is there any room for a little presentation ?
6037	1	a	maybe during the discussion section ?
6038	0	a	Okay .
6039	0	a	There is ?
6040	0	a	Yeah , there is .
6041	0	a	No problem .
6042	0	a	okay ,
6043	0	a	this new product we are are
6044	0	a	g are going to develop , it is a remote control , a television remote control .
6045	0	a	and first of all it should be original , it should be trendy and user friendly .
6046	0	a	Those are kind of easy goals ,
6047	1	a	and I am sure we can find more goals for the for the product we are going to develop .
6048	1	a	we will discuss later on more ideas about how the remote should look and how it sh it should function and all those kind of things .
6049	0	a	Okay .
6050	1	a	The market , we should have a look at the market .
6051	0	a	we are going to use a a pred a project method during this development , which consists of three different design stages .
6052	0	a	the functional design , the conceptual design and the detailed design , all of these stages mean that we do some individual work , prepare , and then meet to discuss our the
6053	0	a	the the progressions , yes .
6054	0	a	Progressions .
6055	0	a	the first stage , the functional design we are going to search for the user requirements , and we will make a specific specification of that .
6056	0	a	the second is the technical functional design , what effect should the remote have ?
6057	0	a	Well in this case control t the the television I think .
6058	0	a	It is for the vision .
6059	0	a	Yeah .
6060	0	a	and the last one is the working design .
6061	0	a	How exactly does it work in the technical sense .
6062	1	a	the other design stages , we will discuss that later .
6063	1	a	So we will kop it keep it with the functional design .
6064	1	a	Okay , before we think about remote control we will work with some of the tools we have here .
6065	0	a	as you see now I can give a presentation .
6066	0	a	it is also possible to use this one as well .
6067	0	a	You can display pr two presentations if you want to .
6068	0	a	to presentate , to show us a file you will need to place it in your project documents folder , which is on your desktop , at least it should be .
6069	0	a	then we have this electronic white board system .
6070	1	a	yeah , I will show that now .
6071	0	a	you can draw on the board using this pen .
6072	0	a	There are little
6073	0	a	sensors ,
6074	1	a	so do not grab it here , but a lit more a little bit more to the to the end .
6075	0	a	Sensors .
6076	0	a	well , it
6077	0	a	it is on the eraser now , so we click the pen button .
6078	0	a	Okay , so not too fast writing .
6079	0	a	you can insert a new slide or or white board file by either using the insert function or by clicking the next button or the blank button .
6080	0	a	It is quite the same .
6081	1	a	all our whi SMARTboard notes should be kept in the same file .
6082	1	a	So do not m make a new file .
6083	1	a	Just use this one during the day .
6084	0	a	you can use the eraser to make something go away .
6085	0	a	But we all use the same white board file
6086	0	a	So we can work together on it while we are or should we only use it in the in the meetings ?
6087	0	a	Yeah , okay .
6088	0	a	Yes .
6089	0	a	Yeah .
6090	0	a	Yeah , in the meetings , only in the meetings .
6091	0	a	It is really like like a regu regular whiteboard .
6092	0	a	Yeah , alright .
6093	0	a	Yep .
6094	0	a	you can choose the format ,
6095	0	a	sorry .
6096	0	a	Let me see .
6097	0	a	Well
6098	0	a	I guess it is maybe because I am not s pen selected .
6099	0	a	Yep .
6100	0	a	Current colour , you can choose another colour .
6101	0	a	And for example black , and you c I can choose the line width .
6102	0	a	so now I d have a different line width and colour .
6103	0	a	Okay .
6104	0	a	Quite easy ,
6105	0	a	if you do have any questions , just c ask me .
6106	0	a	to
6107	0	a	oh well , I am
6108	0	a	I wrote down the documents should be in the project documents folder if you want to discuss it with us .
6109	1	a	as a little training I will ask Ruud first to draw your own animal on a new slide with a different colour and a different line width than the one now selected .
6110	1	a	Okay .
6111	0	a	green .
6112	0	a	An animal .
6113	0	a	Okay .
6114	0	a	a wee rabbit .
6115	0	a	It is a bunny .
6116	0	a	A rabbit .
6117	0	a	Alright .
6118	0	a	Okay , well great .
6119	1	a	Roo , could you do the same please ?
6120	1	a	But a different animal with a different colour and a different line width .
6121	1	a	But of course , Flores .
6122	0	a	Blank .
6123	0	a	Sebastian is thinking about the animal .
6124	0	a	I am just guessing what should be my favourite animal .
6125	0	a	Okay .
6126	0	a	Yeah , I am think about it too .
6127	0	a	Format .
6128	0	a	Well , it looked more than a bunny than a cat , but it works ,
6129	0	a	right ?
6130	0	a	With a very small legs .
6131	0	a	It it should be a cat .
6132	0	a	Yeah .
6133	0	a	Okay ?
6134	0	a	I am guessing a horse .
6135	1	a	Well , I will give it a try .
6136	0	a	Very good .
6137	0	a	I was very good in drawing .
6138	0	a	You should feed that that animal .
6139	0	a	Well , I guess you get the idea .
6140	0	a	Yes , okay .
6141	0	a	Beautiful .
6142	0	a	Beautiful .
6143	0	a	Okay , so you can use this at any time during the presentation if you want to .
6144	0	a	any questions well , just just let me know .
6145	0	a	okay ,
6146	0	a	back to our project .
6147	0	a	the remote control we are going to develop will have a selling price of about twenty five Euros .
6148	0	a	the profit we are looking for for this product is fifty million Euros , which is quite a number .
6149	0	a	we we will focus this internationally , so the product will be sold , if there is market interest , in in more than one country .
6150	0	a	And the production costs should not be more than twelve Euro fifty ,
6151	1	a	so we should keep that in mind by w w during the development ,
6152	0	a	because , well , those are important numbers .
6153	0	a	then the discussion ,
6154	1	a	maybe the time for Sebastian to show his presentation .
6155	1	a	Yes , I have some technical issues which I would like to present to you before we start the discussion ,
6156	0	a	because there might be some influations influences .
6157	0	a	Limitations .
6158	0	a	Okay .
6159	0	a	Okay .
6160	0	a	Okay ?
6161	0	a	Okay .
6162	0	a	Okay , great .
6163	0	a	first about my role , role of the Industrial Designer .
6164	0	a	I would like to think about the implementation of of things , and the technical possibilities and impossibilities .
6165	1	a	So if someone of you comes up with ideas , I will try to translate them in technical functions ,
6166	0	a	but there might be some impossibilities .
6167	0	a	So that is one .
6168	1	a	I also will propose some some implementations for that ,
6169	0	a	but well , these are quite the same .
6170	0	a	Sorry about that .
6171	1	a	and I also will remind people of some new technical possibilities which are available
6172	0	a	and which might be interesting to implement in our product .
6173	0	a	Okay .
6174	1	a	I have some initial ideas about some things
6175	0	a	which are maybe nice to take with you in the upcoming discussion .
6176	0	a	One thing about interopera operability .
6177	0	a	I think a modern remote control should control a device diverse subset of equipment .
6178	0	a	for instance , DVD players , cell phones , video and audio equipment .
6179	0	a	So one re one remote control for all your equipment .
6180	0	a	And for a cell phone ?
6181	0	a	Yeah , okay .
6182	0	a	Well , there should be some interoperabi interoperability between them .
6183	0	a	Yeah .
6184	0	a	I think it could come in handy .
6185	1	a	We should discuss that .
6186	1	a	and we should think about the way how these things should communicate with each other .
6187	0	a	We are not living in the nineteen eighties anymore , so infrared is not is not really hot technical stuff anymore .
6188	1	a	But you should think about the things like Bluetooth .
6189	0	a	But
6190	0	a	Yeah , but the infrared , it is , well , a little bit old fashioned , if you would call it like that .
6191	0	a	But it is cost effective .
6192	0	a	But all the TVs are equipped with infrared , so
6193	0	a	y you
6194	0	a	you can
6195	0	a	Most of them .
6196	0	a	Yes .
6197	0	a	Well , not all , not all .
6198	0	a	So that is the point .
6199	0	a	So
6200	0	a	Maybe ,
6201	1	a	but that is something we should discuss and about every everybody should think about it .
6202	0	a	Or you shou sh use a
6203	1	a	you should equip infrared and Bluetooth together in one remote .
6204	0	a	Yeah .
6205	0	a	So that is just my role ,
6206	1	a	I will just give you everybody some technical input ,
6207	1	a	and I think now the time is to have a little discussion about what the product should be and how it should look , but take these things into account when you start the discussion .
6208	0	a	Yeah .
6209	0	a	Okay ,
6210	0	a	so the the main por the main points you are telling us
6211	0	a	are focus on the inter operability ,
6212	0	a	and
6213	0	a	Okay ,
6214	0	a	and and
6215	0	a	Okay .
6216	0	a	Yes ,
6217	0	a	so one thing one remote control should control one or more pieces of equipment , and the way of communicating with these equipments .
6218	0	a	Okay , good .
6219	0	a	Okay .
6220	0	a	that was your presentation ?
6221	0	a	Okay , okay .
6222	0	a	That is it .
6223	0	a	okay .
6224	0	a	Great .
6225	1	a	I will go back to my own presentation .
6226	0	a	Okay .
6227	1	a	I I do think it is time now to to discuss some things .
6228	0	a	Sebastian told us a few things about the technical implemen implications .
6229	0	a	there are other things like how to make it trendy , which is I think most Ru Ruud is role .
6230	0	a	the way how it should be controlled by the user , which is Roo r during this part .
6231	1	a	so let is start with you .
6232	1	a	H how do you think the remote should function for the user ?
6233	0	a	Yep .
6234	0	a	Well , I had a few things in mind .
6235	0	a	well , the interoperability , just like Sebastian said , the remote should work on different TVs or even different
6236	0	a	Yeah , what is it ,
6237	0	a	devices ?
6238	0	a	so i
6239	0	a	i
6240	0	a	I think it is a universal remote control for customers to buy just new in a store .
6241	0	a	Yes , I think it should be something like that .
6242	0	a	It is not for for for Philips or whatever to buy our remote for their own product ,
6243	0	a	right ?
6244	0	a	Yeah , I do I do not know that .
6245	0	a	Okay , so we are we are going business to consumer ,
6246	0	a	not we are we are it is not a
6247	0	a	No .
6248	0	a	It is no I have
6249	0	a	do not have the information for it .
6250	0	a	We are not developing this product for a specific vendor , are we ?
6251	0	a	No ,
6252	0	a	we are just developing this product , and we want to sell it to a very broad public , so it should fit to every device .
6253	0	a	No .
6254	0	a	No , okay .
6255	0	a	Yeah .
6256	0	a	Yeah .
6257	0	a	Ruud , y do you agree ?
6258	0	a	Okay .
6259	0	a	Yeah , I think I think they are right ,
6260	0	a	yeah .
6261	0	a	Okay .
6262	0	a	Well , the techni fu technical function what you said is just by pressing the button you should change the state of the TV .
6263	0	a	That is just the basic f technical function .
6264	0	a	Yeah .
6265	0	a	So that was my really my part for this session .
6266	0	a	Well , that is just the fu the technical function is pure what should the remote control do , wh what is his task as an as an device .
6267	0	a	So is that ease of use or is that more like
6268	0	a	Okay .
6269	0	a	Yeah .
6270	0	a	It just should change the TV is state .
6271	0	a	So that is it .
6272	0	a	but furthermore
6273	0	a	Yeah .
6274	0	a	And you you see the buttons as a as a means of doing this ?
6275	0	a	Or are there any o other controls ?
6276	0	a	Are there only any other cont
6277	0	a	Well ,
6278	0	a	I I have seen these remote controls with this little stick which you can move forward , sidewords .
6279	0	a	Yeah , with buttons .
6280	0	a	Yeah , or maybe you want a touch screen or
6281	0	a	But
6282	0	a	Yeah .
6283	0	a	Uh huh .
6284	0	a	You know these things .
6285	0	a	And it is very easy for a user to to switch
6286	0	a	w yes ,
6287	0	a	to to switch b between channels or change between tracks on a on a CD , on on a chapters , you know , on a DVD player .
6288	0	a	They are very vu vulnerable .
6289	0	a	Yeah .
6290	0	a	So maybe that is an idea , I do not know .
6291	0	a	Yeah .
6292	0	a	And for other user interface I had , well , it is more industrial thing .
6293	0	a	point at a TV
6294	0	a	, I think it is it is quite disturbing when you always have to point directly to the TV ,
6295	1	a	so you must point everywhere ,
6296	0	a	so maybe infrared is
6297	0	a	Yeah , just do not even point it ,
6298	1	a	so in that case infrared should maybe be restriction to that .
6299	0	a	Okay .
6300	1	a	Maybe not even pointed .
6301	0	a	Yeah .
6302	0	a	Okay
6303	0	a	Okay , gentlemen , just a reminder , we d we have five minutes left for this meeting
6304	0	a	okay .
6305	0	a	is that
6306	0	a	are there restriction for the range , the operating range too ?
6307	0	a	So when you are not able to point at the device the range is very limited .
6308	0	a	Yeah , if you g if you go to radio or or yeah .
6309	0	a	For TV , you are always in in the neighbourhood of a TV ,
6310	0	a	so I do not think think the range should be a problem to that , but if you want to get it working with a radio , and you are in outside your garden with just one speaker , then maybe the range should be
6311	0	a	But
6312	0	a	Yeah .
6313	0	a	Okay .
6314	0	a	Okay .
6315	1	a	Two more things .
6316	0	a	You should able to feel the buttons without it mis
6317	0	a	you have to know what you do without looking at the buttons ,
6318	1	a	so it should be as user interface for feeling should be good to understand .
6319	1	a	You must feel the buttons for volume or whatever , I think .
6320	0	a	Okay , s yeah .
6321	0	a	Yeah .
6322	0	a	And of course you do not always know where all buttons are ,
6323	1	a	so it should be visible al in dark too .
6324	0	a	So when it is dark
6325	0	a	Those are two really user interface
6326	0	a	Yeah .
6327	0	a	Okay .
6328	1	a	I will write down glow in the dark .
6329	0	a	That is perfect .
6330	0	a	Is tha
6331	0	a	Okay .
6332	0	a	Okay .
6333	1	a	Okay , I just want to hear Ruud is input for this meeting .
6334	0	a	Do do you
6335	0	a	well yes , I had , about three minutes ago , but I have seem to forget them forgot them .
6336	0	a	do you have anything already w ab idea about how the market will respond to the such a product ?
6337	1	a	Or what we should take in account when developing such a product ?
6338	0	a	I think most most things have already been said , like control multiple devices .
6339	0	a	And , yeah , infrared might be an issue .
6340	0	a	Because ?
6341	0	a	well , he said about n abo
6342	0	a	what he said about pointing .
6343	0	a	But lots of devices already use infrared .
6344	1	a	So we will probably have to implement that .
6345	0	a	Okay .
6346	0	a	Okay .
6347	1	a	Okay , Sebastian , did you have any other ideas ?
6348	0	a	Okay .
6349	0	a	oh yes , I remember .
6350	0	a	you said something about visibility in the dark .
6351	1	a	would it be nice for a user to have display on this remote control , on which you can see functions ?
6352	0	a	Which makes it easier to operate it .
6353	0	a	Yeah .
6354	0	a	Yeah .
6355	0	a	Well , maybe I
6356	1	a	but it it can be quite simple , you can just have white buttons with a black mark on it .
6357	0	a	I I do not know .
6358	0	a	Okay .
6359	1	a	The the the digits in black .
6360	0	a	then it is already visible in dark .
6361	0	a	Okay .
6362	0	a	So it it do not have to be a lightning or or a fancy well , it can be for design , of course .
6363	0	a	Okay .
6364	0	a	Yeah ,
6365	0	a	yeah ,
6366	0	a	okay ,
6367	0	a	because because we wa we want to develop a trendy product .
6368	0	a	Yes , but there is a cost limitation too .
6369	0	a	So
6370	0	a	Yeah ,
6371	0	a	twelve Euro fifty ,
6372	0	a	yeah .
6373	0	a	Well , that is more
6374	0	a	So that is a big problem , I think .
6375	0	a	I think the the financial part of this project implicates that it is not going to be a high high end product .
6376	0	a	The cost price is very low .
6377	0	a	Okay .
6378	0	a	Okay .
6379	1	a	Just remind something .
6380	1	a	The digits of the the painting on the buttons should not fade .
6381	0	a	Okay , okay .
6382	0	a	You have a m
6383	0	a	Always have s the soft buttons , always clear the the the paint on it .
6384	0	a	Very good point .
6385	0	a	Yeah .
6386	0	a	The marks .
6387	0	a	Okay .
6388	0	a	Okay ,
6389	1	a	I
6390	1	a	ha I have one point f
6391	1	a	which which comes in mind now .
6392	1	a	d I think the device should either be rechargeable very easily or it should not consume too much power .
6393	0	a	Okay .
6394	0	a	Because it is very annoying if you need to change the batteries every s every other week .
6395	0	a	Yeah .
6396	0	a	Okay .
6397	0	a	So
6398	1	a	maybe we could for example only light the buttons that are applicable at that moment or
6399	0	a	yeah .
6400	0	a	But
6401	0	a	Necessary ,
6402	0	a	yeah .
6403	0	a	I dunno ,
6404	0	a	it is
6405	0	a	that is more Sebastian is
6406	0	a	Well does it ?
6407	0	a	I am not sure .
6408	0	a	Yeah .
6409	0	a	But then Bluetooth might be problem .
6410	0	a	Cause I think Bluetooth
6411	0	a	Yeah ,
6412	0	a	I know it from the cell phone .
6413	0	a	It is use a lot of
6414	0	a	well
6415	0	a	Well , cell phones have integrated Bluetooth also and , well , it is it seems to work quite okay .
6416	0	a	Yeah .
6417	0	a	So technically it will be possible .
6418	0	a	But you ca not you ca not use Bluetooth all the time , twenty four hours a day .
6419	0	a	No , you cannot .
6420	0	a	Okay .
6421	0	a	Does it
6422	0	a	It is over ?
6423	0	a	Okay .
6424	0	a	Gentlemen , I am afraid we do not have any more time .
6425	0	a	Okay .
6426	1	a	so we will go back to our own work .
6427	0	a	next meeting starts in thirty minutes and , well , you know your o your individual actions or your personal coach will probably email you about th it .
6428	0	a	so
6429	0	a	this was it .
6430	0	a	 
6431	0	a	Welcome back .
6432	0	a	Hello .
6433	0	a	Hello .
6434	0	a	let me see .
6435	0	a	There is one of mine .
6436	0	a	Okay .
6437	0	a	Roo , welcome back .
6438	0	a	Hello , Flores .
6439	0	a	The waiting is for Sebastian .
6440	0	a	There he is .
6441	0	a	We have a slight problem .
6442	0	a	Is there any time for a cup of coffee ?
6443	0	a	Can I get a cup of coffee ?
6444	0	a	Okay .
6445	0	a	I opened the CD ROM box guys .
6446	0	a	Sorry ?
6447	0	a	no .
6448	0	a	You ca not ,
6449	0	a	sorry .
6450	0	a	So
6451	0	a	just cancel it .
6452	0	a	Well ,
6453	0	a	during my work I have no time either .
6454	0	a	So
6455	0	a	I think so too .
6456	0	a	Well ,
6457	0	a	this is life .
6458	0	a	Sorry
6459	0	a	, Roo .
6460	0	a	Yeah ,
6461	0	a	I opened the CD ROM box .
6462	0	a	Okay .
6463	0	a	Accidentally .
6464	0	a	Okay .
6465	0	a	But it is alright .
6466	0	a	People , welcome back with the second meeting .
6467	0	a	for now on the schedule are a few points .
6468	0	a	first of all the opening , which we are doing now .
6469	0	a	second , I received some new project requirements .
6470	0	a	I am not sure if you received them as well ,
6471	1	a	but I will tell you about it .
6472	0	a	then the three of you prepared a presentation , I think ?
6473	0	a	Sebastian ?
6474	0	a	Roo ?
6475	0	a	Ruud ?
6476	0	a	Almost , okay .
6477	0	a	Yeah .
6478	0	a	Almost .
6479	1	a	Then we will do your one as la the last .
6480	0	a	the top goal of this m
6481	1	a	we will figure that out .
6482	0	a	But you ca not upload your presentation from here , I believe .
6483	0	a	Okay .
6484	0	a	Ca can you try to
6485	0	a	Yeah ,
6486	1	a	w we will see .
6487	1	a	if it if it if it is wireless
6488	1	a	I could just put it in the .
6489	0	a	I do not think it is wireless here .
6490	0	a	it is , yeah .
6491	0	a	It is .
6492	0	a	Or it is .
6493	0	a	It is .
6494	0	a	Yeah ?
6495	0	a	Okay , great .
6496	0	a	okay .
6497	0	a	Yeah .
6498	0	a	the top goal of this meeting is to reach a decision on the product , on the target group and and the functions of the remote control ,
6499	1	a	so keep that in mind .
6500	0	a	we have forty minutes .
6501	0	a	So
6502	0	a	it is now
6503	0	a	Yep .
6504	0	a	Okay .
6505	0	a	the new project requirements , first of all , we did not speak about it , but we should not support teletext in the remote , because our b board feels that teletext is out of date and internet is replacing teletext .
6506	0	a	So we are not even going to try to implement it in our product .
6507	0	a	It is a board decision .
6508	0	a	the remote control should only be used for television , because it is not f feasible ,
6509	0	a	it is not w
6510	0	a	we we cannot make it because of the time to market that we have to deal with .
6511	0	a	Yeah .
6512	0	a	Time ,
6513	0	a	yeah .
6514	0	a	the third requirement is that we should focus on customers that are younger than forty , which is important for you , Ruud , and as well for Roo .
6515	0	a	Because the product should be interesting and and should be bought by people younger than forty .
6516	0	a	then for Roo , as well important , the corporate image should be recognisable in our product .
6517	0	a	So the colour colours and the slogan do have to be in the product .
6518	0	a	Yes .
6519	0	a	Is that clear ?
6520	0	a	Any questions on these requirements ?
6521	0	a	No ?
6522	0	a	Okay .
6523	1	a	the individual presentations ,
6524	0	a	I th
6525	1	a	Roo or Sebastian , who of you would like to start ?
6526	0	a	yeah .
6527	0	a	Yeah , I will start .
6528	0	a	Yes .
6529	0	a	Okay ,
6530	0	a	great .
6531	0	a	Oh ,
6532	0	a	how can I
6533	0	a	Geez , and sli and show .
6534	0	a	Just press it .
6535	0	a	yes .
6536	0	a	Alright .
6537	0	a	well
6538	0	a	w we we had discussed this already in the fin in the previous discussion .
6539	0	a	the method of the remote control is just
6540	0	a	the function of remote control is basically to send messages to the television set .
6541	0	a	So that was the main important thing what a remote control should do .
6542	0	a	Yeah .
6543	0	a	Then I found two different kind of remote controls , the multi function remote control with many possibilities , but the lack of the feeling I already mentioned in the previous discussion .
6544	0	a	And the ease of use remote control with the less p possibilities but a great feeling in in touching the buttons .
6545	0	a	Yeah .
6546	0	a	but yeah .
6547	0	a	My personal preferences were ease of the easy to use remote control ,
6548	0	a	because the user friendliness and it can be more trendy in in user design .
6549	0	a	But your new goal f was for people than less than forty years old .
6550	0	a	Uh huh .
6551	1	a	So maybe the multi function can be implemented in in our design .
6552	1	a	But it should b
6553	1	a	I think it should be a combination ,
6554	0	a	but teletext buttons are not in our design .
6555	0	a	So it should take out , well , eight buttons or so .
6556	0	a	But my in my opinion , the the easy to use RC is the best possi possibility for us .
6557	0	a	Okay .
6558	0	a	Ruud , did you get that ?
6559	0	a	Okay , so
6560	0	a	the important thing here is In the market ,
6561	0	a	yeah .
6562	0	a	Yeah , b most .
6563	0	a	Yeah .
6564	0	a	And it is also i indeed Ruud is insight in the in the topic .
6565	0	a	Oh ,
6566	0	a	user friendly .
6567	0	a	Yeah ,
6568	0	a	what what does the market want ?
6569	0	a	I I do not know .
6570	0	a	Yeah , okay ,
6571	0	a	w we will s we all
6572	0	a	Yeah .
6573	1	a	Just for for user desi user friendliness I should choose for the the ease of use remote control .
6574	0	a	Okay .
6575	1	a	Sebastian .
6576	0	a	Okay .
6577	0	a	Excuse me .
6578	0	a	Scusi .
6579	0	a	Okay ,
6580	0	a	it is still the right thing .
6581	0	a	Okay .
6582	0	a	well ,
6583	0	a	there are some changes in the design requirements , so there are some changes in the method also .
6584	0	a	basically all this device has to do is send messages to a TV set .
6585	0	a	And the m most easy way to do this is by sending pulses of infrared light to a TV set .
6586	0	a	Well ,
6587	0	a	I th
6588	0	a	I tried to implement a picture here , but it is hardly readable .
6589	0	a	Energies and
6590	0	a	Yeah .
6591	0	a	Can you see it ?
6592	0	a	No ?
6593	0	a	Well ,
6594	0	a	there is a energy source here .
6595	0	a	No , it is not visible .
6596	0	a	And basically
6597	0	a	there
6598	0	a	it is connected to three things .
6599	0	a	The user interface connected to a chip , which is connected to the sender , which generates messages using infrared light , which are sent to the receiver .
6600	0	a	That is basically the idea .
6601	0	a	And there is a little picture , just for your imagination , how a device like this should look or can look .
6602	0	a	Okay .
6603	0	a	what have I found .
6604	0	a	Usually these kind of things consist of a battery , infrared diode , buttons , chips , and circuit board .
6605	0	a	That is all .
6606	0	a	It is cased together , nothing more than that .
6607	0	a	It is almost every piece of equipment every piece of every TV set is controlled infrared .
6608	0	a	There are some exceptions , but most of all have infrared controls .
6609	0	a	And the more luxury remote controls have lithium buttons .
6610	0	a	And I think that is what we w
6611	0	a	yes .
6612	0	a	The glow in the dark concept we discussed .
6613	0	a	In the
6614	0	a	and it is a little more a little bit more fancy also .
6615	1	a	So maybe we should consider that .
6616	0	a	Yeah .
6617	0	a	Okay .
6618	0	a	Okay .
6619	0	a	I have a basic scheme of the things which are implemented .
6620	0	a	basically this is all there is .
6621	0	a	There is just one chip .
6622	0	a	There are a few buttons connected .
6623	0	a	the buttons are lit .
6624	0	a	And the whole thing is transmitted by a infrared li diode , and there is not a power source here .
6625	0	a	So
6626	0	a	that is basically the total design of this piece of equipment .
6627	0	a	There is nothing more to it .
6628	0	a	So it is fairly easy .
6629	0	a	It is fairly easy .
6630	0	a	It is been done many times before , and I think we should we should c s succeed in in our plan to do this .
6631	0	a	Okay .
6632	0	a	Succeed in it also .
6633	0	a	Okay ,
6634	0	a	good .
6635	0	a	So Okay , so
6636	1	a	personally I think we should infra use infrared ,
6637	0	a	because otherwise our device cannot communicate with almost every TV set .
6638	0	a	So I think that should be clear .
6639	0	a	Okay .
6640	1	a	another important point is we really should use energy sparse , friendly components .
6641	0	a	there are specially designed energy friendly components which consume far less power than conventional components .
6642	1	a	And if we want to use a rechargeable design or a energy save design , we should really implement them .
6643	1	a	for cost effectiveness , we should really use a very low cost circuit board ,
6644	0	a	because most of the production cost are are in this part of the equipment .
6645	0	a	Okay .
6646	1	a	And the money we save on using this we can use for elaborate fancy lighting techniques , blinking LEDs and all that kind of fancy stuff .
6647	0	a	I think our users will really will really like that .
6648	0	a	And what is the
6649	0	a	if we use the LEDs , i does it use much more energy
6650	0	a	or
6651	0	a	Okay .
6652	0	a	No , they are p f power friendly LEDs also .
6653	1	a	So we can use them .
6654	0	a	So that is no problem .
6655	0	a	For the same costs ,
6656	0	a	it is can be in our
6657	0	a	Combined with the low cost circuit board
6658	0	a	so it is
6659	0	a	Yeah .
6660	0	a	no , they are they are a little bit more expensive ,
6661	0	a	but by making
6662	0	a	We can we can make its I think .
6663	0	a	Well
6664	1	a	you could only lit the buttons the buttons that are used most .
6665	1	a	So , the channel switching .
6666	0	a	Yeah .
6667	0	a	Or
6668	0	a	, true .
6669	0	a	Yeah ,
6670	0	a	but but the question is whether two or four buttons makes m makes such a difference in the costs if you already plan to include fancy lightning techniques , I guess .
6671	0	a	Okay .
6672	0	a	But I think
6673	0	a	Yeah ,
6674	0	a	I think it is the same as in the cell phone , just light in in the device that that shines on all the buttons ,
6675	0	a	and not for
6676	0	a	Yeah , but not for each button one LED , I think .
6677	0	a	Yes .
6678	0	a	Well ,
6679	0	a	it is not one light ,
6680	0	a	it
6681	0	a	there are more lights in a in a in a mobile device .
6682	0	a	No no
6683	0	a	no , no .
6684	0	a	That is right , that is right .
6685	0	a	Okay .
6686	0	a	So well ,
6687	0	a	this should be it .
6688	0	a	Okay .
6689	1	a	have a think about it .
6690	0	a	Yeah .
6691	0	a	Okay ,
6692	1	a	Ruud .
6693	0	a	Oh , mine is already outdated .
6694	0	a	Okay well ,
6695	0	a	we ar we are very curio curious to what the market will feel about such a product .
6696	0	a	Since
6697	0	a	Okay ,
6698	0	a	make
6699	0	a	Well
6700	0	a	then I am sure the target market is ten million units .
6701	0	a	So any income is welcome .
6702	0	a	Input .
6703	0	a	Of of which we should sell about forty percent to make the five million .
6704	0	a	Could you step a little bit more to the right ?
6705	0	a	Yeah ,
6706	0	a	thank you .
6707	0	a	Okay .
6708	0	a	But since the other part is forty percent of the market ,
6709	1	a	I thought earlier we might want to constrain that portion of the market .
6710	0	a	But since the requirements changed ,
6711	0	a	that is not a good idea .
6712	0	a	well ,
6713	1	a	skip this .
6714	0	a	Yeah .
6715	0	a	Well ,
6716	0	a	it is
6717	0	a	this till true , of course .
6718	0	a	That they only use ten percent the buttons .
6719	0	a	The buttons to zap are used the about fifteen hundred times , when the power button is only used one time .
6720	0	a	And the volume button is only four times .
6721	0	a	So they are obv obviously the most important buttons .
6722	0	a	And lots of people complained they kin ca not find their remote control .
6723	1	a	So we might want to build in a feature to support them .
6724	1	a	Some audio signal .
6725	1	a	Like home phones .
6726	0	a	Okay .
6727	0	a	Or
6728	0	a	Yeah .
6729	0	a	Well ,
6730	0	a	that is interesting .
6731	1	a	Or a find a finding function ,
6732	0	a	you know .
6733	0	a	Yeah .
6734	0	a	Yeah ,
6735	0	a	that is definitely interesting .
6736	0	a	That is quite a
6737	0	a	yes .
6738	0	a	It it separates our product from others as well .
6739	0	a	Sound signal .
6740	0	a	Yeah .
6741	0	a	Okay ,
6742	1	a	go on .
6743	0	a	Yes .
6744	0	a	Well ,
6745	0	a	I just said that .
6746	0	a	And well ,
6747	0	a	this obvious , and he also said it .
6748	0	a	Okay .
6749	0	a	So
6750	0	a	that is what the market tells us .
6751	0	a	that is about it , yes .
6752	0	a	Yep .
6753	0	a	Okay .
6754	0	a	The volume and the zap buttons are the mostly used .
6755	0	a	mo zap buttons most .
6756	0	a	So
6757	0	a	Yeah , well
6758	1	a	it should just have a design
6759	1	a	The perfect design for those only those buttons .
6760	0	a	Volume , they are use a lot .
6761	0	a	But more than all the other buttons .
6762	0	a	So
6763	0	a	Yeah , that is a problem .
6764	0	a	Yes .
6765	0	a	And first
6766	0	a	Yeah .
6767	0	a	Yes , we should focus on that , I guess .
6768	0	a	Yep .
6769	0	a	Well ,
6770	0	a	the technical there
6771	0	a	I think there are no technical difficulties .
6772	0	a	There is no elaborate technique used in this kind of equipment .
6773	0	a	So
6774	0	a	I do not think we have any hiccups there .
6775	0	a	So we can fully concentrate on developing a product that is really what the market needs .
6776	1	a	So maybe it is a good idea to think about these buttons and and and a sound signal .
6777	0	a	Yeah ,
6778	1	a	the sound signal .
6779	0	a	Just one thing
6780	1	a	I am just wondering , the sound signal , from where do you execute th the s sound ?
6781	0	a	Another device is not a solution .
6782	0	a	Well
6783	0	a	Yes .
6784	0	a	Th that is a bit of that is a problem .
6785	0	a	Yeah .
6786	0	a	Well
6787	1	a	maybe maybe like clapping in your hands , like turning on and off the the the lights .
6788	0	a	Usually
6789	0	a	Oh yes .
6790	0	a	It should be
6791	0	a	Yeah ,
6792	1	a	but maybe you will get some new technologies for it .
6793	0	a	Yes .
6794	0	a	Well ,
6795	0	a	there there are some devices who incorporate this technique already .
6796	0	a	there are video sets and they have a special button , the find the remote control button .
6797	0	a	You press it and your TV set starts to make a kind of weird sound , and your remote controls then start to beep .
6798	0	a	Reports rep respend response to it .
6799	0	a	And
6800	0	a	Yes .
6801	0	a	Yeah ,
6802	0	a	just like the phones
6803	0	a	the
6804	0	a	But but TVs do not have all buttons .
6805	0	a	Yes , that is it .
6806	0	a	Yes , same thing .
6807	0	a	Yeah .
6808	0	a	But th
6809	0	a	Yeah ,
6810	0	a	because we do not have a a a a a home
6811	0	a	Okay .
6812	0	a	No ,
6813	1	a	so we we should use something else .
6814	0	a	And you
6815	0	a	Yeah ,
6816	0	a	and usually
6817	0	a	And even if the TV set would have such a button , you would have to walk to your TV ,
6818	0	a	and it is
6819	0	a	And b
6820	0	a	So if if you would be watching a movie , it would constantly beep .
6821	0	a	But I believe you will have an
6822	0	a	I am convinced Sebastian will find one solution for us .
6823	0	a	We do not control the TV set so well .
6824	0	a	Yes , m yes .
6825	0	a	S
6826	0	a	and we b we want to make
6827	0	a	so it is is easy as possible for our customers ,
6828	0	a	so we should think about
6829	0	a	It is quite complicated .
6830	0	a	So
6831	0	a	what about the clapping technique ?
6832	0	a	because you se
6833	0	a	Well ,
6834	0	a	you see it a lot in in light lightning
6835	0	a	Yeah , a peak .
6836	0	a	Well ,
6837	0	a	it is quite complicated .
6838	0	a	Because how can you separate the clapping sound from other sounds .
6839	0	a	Yes , yes .
6840	0	a	Well , basically
6841	0	a	the characteristics the characteristics of clapping is just an increase in the volume , the amplitude of the sound , which is generated a few times within a certain period of time .
6842	0	a	Yeah .
6843	0	a	Yeah .
6844	0	a	But there are many other sounds which are exactly the same from the point of view from a remote control .
6845	0	a	Yeah , that is true .
6846	0	a	Yes ,
6847	0	a	so we do not want that .
6848	1	a	But we can have just a home stat f a base station next to the TV .
6849	0	a	Maybe we can
6850	0	a	Something like that .
6851	1	a	Just a little antenna or something .
6852	0	a	Well
6853	0	a	if you lost th
6854	0	a	I do not think people would bother walking to the TV and press that button because they lost the their remote .
6855	0	a	Well ,
6856	1	a	is there not something
6857	1	a	f something more easily
6858	0	a	Well ,
6859	0	a	I do not think .
6860	0	a	Well
6861	0	a	Yeah .
6862	0	a	that is just
6863	0	a	just a base station next to the TV is the best possibility .
6864	0	a	No ,
6865	0	a	and y the
6866	0	a	the most important thing for people is that there is a central point to which they can go and b perform a a some kind of .
6867	0	a	And then the remote control reports itself ,
6868	0	a	so
6869	0	a	w we should use have
6870	1	a	we should use something like that .
6871	1	a	You do not want another device , which can be everywhere in the house , which you have to find first before you can find your remote control .
6872	0	a	Yes , something like that .
6873	0	a	But that will be very costly , I think .
6874	0	a	So that is not a good idea .
6875	0	a	Yeah ,
6876	1	a	m maybe w we we do agree on on the thing that the remote should have such a function , if it is possible within the costs and all that kind of things .
6877	0	a	Yeah .
6878	1	a	maybe Sebastian should have a detailed look later on and come up with a solution ,
6879	0	a	because that is his his field of expertise .
6880	0	a	I will .
6881	0	a	Yeah .
6882	0	a	Yes .
6883	0	a	Yes .
6884	0	a	But before I do that I w I want to warn you that by implementing this kind of a function the technical design will become more complicated and it will become more costly also .
6885	0	a	Yep .
6886	0	a	Because there will be additional components which which will be used .
6887	0	a	And there are some implepe imp
6888	0	a	Well ,
6889	0	a	I I think so ,
6890	0	a	because when you have a p newspaper over your remote control , you cannot see it .
6891	0	a	And do we even prefer the sound above the the LEDs , the lightning function ?
6892	0	a	It is a unique item It will be an a unique feature of our remote control .
6893	0	a	So
6894	0	a	Okay .
6895	0	a	Yeah , it is a distinction in the market .
6896	0	a	It is a different
6897	0	a	exactly .
6898	0	a	Yeah .
6899	0	a	It is an uni an unique feature , and I think it is worth looking and and probably more i interesting than than the lights .
6900	0	a	Yeah .
6901	0	a	And just about the user interface , I came up with an easy remote control and an advanced remote control .
6902	0	a	Yeah .
6903	1	a	What should we choose in in design ?
6904	0	a	Well , the extra functions .
6905	0	a	Yeah .
6906	0	a	Well ,
6907	0	a	according to Ruud , people do not use all the extra features very very often .
6908	0	a	So
6909	0	a	Okay .
6910	1	a	I have the numbers r I have the numbers right here .
6911	0	a	Well , t
6912	0	a	we wo not support teletext which which was the third most the second most used function .
6913	0	a	Used option .
6914	0	a	Okay .
6915	0	a	Well ,
6916	0	a	we we do have a wise board ,
6917	1	a	so I am not questioning that .
6918	0	a	well yeah ,
6919	0	a	channel selection is obviously the most important .
6920	0	a	Yeah .
6921	0	a	Okay , so
6922	0	a	on the relevance scale the channel selection , the volume selection and the teletext .
6923	0	a	So
6924	0	a	Yeah .
6925	0	a	Well ,
6926	1	a	we skip that .
6927	0	a	Yeah .
6928	0	a	So
6929	0	a	Nope .
6930	0	a	Well ,
6931	1	a	so it just th the basic functions .
6932	0	a	Okay .
6933	0	a	And we do not have to use it for DVD players and all kind of stuff .
6934	0	a	No , no .
6935	0	a	No .
6936	0	a	So
6937	0	a	Yeah .
6938	0	a	So
6939	0	a	that is out of the question .
6940	0	a	Yeah .
6941	0	a	So
6942	0	a	I think also .
6943	1	a	Just through the easy design .
6944	1	a	I think we should go for the easier one .
6945	1	a	We can make a nice design when when there is not mu much buttons in it .
6946	0	a	Yes .
6947	0	a	So
6948	1	a	just a few buttons , trendy design , nice lightning effects wh and the sound .
6949	0	a	Well ,
6950	0	a	we should save costs by not implementing a lot of functions
6951	1	a	and the money that we can save from that we should use for having a nice design and thinking about the user interface
6952	0	a	and
6953	0	a	Yeah , that is right .
6954	0	a	No .
6955	0	a	Yeah .
6956	0	a	Okay ,
6957	0	a	Ruud , how do you feel about that ?
6958	0	a	do you agree ,
6959	0	a	do you think the market would would respond to a simple
6960	0	a	well
6961	0	a	if we include other innovative functions then they might , cause young people like new features .
6962	0	a	yeah .
6963	0	a	So
6964	0	a	And if you use that stick for volume control and channel selection , you have the m two most important functions in one button .
6965	0	a	Okay , so
6966	0	a	this is is kind of
6967	0	a	Yeah .
6968	0	a	Okay .
6969	0	a	Well ,
6970	0	a	is it
6971	0	a	maybe there is another possibility .
6972	1	a	You can make it look like an easy s piece of equipment , but it is quite elaborated ,
6973	0	a	because it has many functions .
6974	1	a	Maybe it is more important to make the make it look like a very friendly , easy to catch piece of equipment ,
6975	0	a	but nevertheless
6976	0	a	But but are we not in in the in the manual
6977	0	a	I mean if you have few buttons , no display , I mean I guess it is l it is working with with a shift functions and one button
6978	0	a	can
6979	0	a	But but how does how does the remote report r give back to the user w in what state it is ?
6980	0	a	Because we do not implement a user history .
6981	0	a	Ok like that .
6982	0	a	Well ,
6983	0	a	I was more thinking about a more elaborate way of controlling , by by these kinds of sticks or something like that .
6984	0	a	I do not know if if it is user friendly .
6985	0	a	That is your field of expertise .
6986	0	a	Yeah ,
6987	0	a	I do not know yet .
6988	0	a	There is no , but there is no way to do that , because we cannot implement that kind of the system .
6989	0	a	I know , but
6990	0	a	but if we use like a stick , for example ,
6991	0	a	Yeah .
6992	0	a	W
6993	0	a	Well ,
6994	1	a	maybe we can use a light for that .
6995	1	a	When you move the stick to a to a position , maybe a light next to it can lit up .
6996	0	a	So you know I have just pushed the button , or I changed the channel or t turned up the volume .
6997	1	a	Something like that .
6998	0	a	Yes .
6999	1	a	and we could have other buttons for the for the advanced functions .
7000	0	a	But does it I
7001	1	a	then should n just use i instead of the stick , like many cell phones , just a round
7002	0	a	m
7003	0	a	well ,
7004	0	a	should we just use a it is already
7005	0	a	oh , we have a blank .
7006	0	a	Yeah ,
7007	1	a	draw draw it on the board .
7008	0	a	Oh .
7009	0	a	Oh
7010	0	a	yeah , something like that .
7011	0	a	It is not really a stick ,
7012	0	a	but
7013	0	a	Yes .
7014	1	a	It is just an easy way of of a round button what which can be pushed in four directions .
7015	0	a	Yes .
7016	1	a	Instead of a stick .
7017	0	a	A stick is v vulnerab vulnerable when it is falling down
7018	0	a	or
7019	1	a	just a round button should be the trick , I think .
7020	0	a	Yeah , it can break down .
7021	0	a	Yes , yes .
7022	0	a	Yeah .
7023	0	a	And
7024	0	a	Yes , and this also looks more fancy , I think .
7025	0	a	I think it it will attract more public , I think .
7026	0	a	Yeah .
7027	0	a	A younger Huh .
7028	0	a	But you are the marketing man .
7029	0	a	And it is also quite easy to use , so it will it attract younger people because well new , and it might attract older people because it is easy to use .
7030	0	a	Geez .
7031	0	a	Well ,
7032	1	a	volume and something like that .
7033	0	a	Uh huh .
7034	0	a	The programme up and down .
7035	0	a	Okay , yeah .
7036	0	a	And the vol
7037	0	a	yeah ,
7038	0	a	the pen does not really does what I want .
7039	0	a	Okay , that is good .
7040	0	a	Okay ,
7041	0	a	but w we still we are still in the question of putting in advanced options .
7042	0	a	Ruud just told us the market is interested in some advanced new techniques .
7043	0	a	however , keeping it simple is is important for the costs and all all those kind of things .
7044	1	a	We need to find a balance between the advanced techniques and and the user friendliness .
7045	0	a	But I think our our next step to look at is just that .
7046	0	a	So I do not think it is we have something to do .
7047	0	a	we ca not discuss it right now , because n no one of us have has the information to discuss about that , I think .
7048	0	a	well ,
7049	0	a	for
7050	0	a	we do have to decide this this meeting .
7051	0	a	Yes ?
7052	0	a	Yeah .
7053	0	a	We need to have the the user function the functions decided and our target audience .
7054	0	a	Okay .
7055	0	a	Kay ,
7056	0	a	but teletext is so is just scrapped .
7057	0	a	Okay .
7058	0	a	Do do you want a list of functions ?
7059	0	a	Do you want an explicit list ? which incorporates all function available on the device ?
7060	0	a	Okay .
7061	0	a	well ,
7062	0	a	I do not want a full
7063	0	a	it is not necessary to to have a full list , but I want the kind of functions , for example th the most important are volume and programme selecting .
7064	0	a	Okay .
7065	0	a	The ten digits .
7066	0	a	Well ,
7067	1	a	for example , that that is what we should think about .
7068	0	a	l
7069	1	a	how is the remote going to look ?
7070	1	a	Not not in the user interface , but
7071	0	a	Yeah .
7072	0	a	Oh ,
7073	1	a	and just one function .
7074	1	a	The the the the programme to programme button , the switch to two channels , when you have something on channel four and something on channel six , just one button which which can change
7075	0	a	yeah .
7076	0	a	Yes .
7077	0	a	A bit of a split mode .
7078	0	a	Change .
7079	0	a	l like Yeah .
7080	0	a	Yes , yes .
7081	0	a	Dual channel watch .
7082	0	a	Yes .
7083	0	a	Yeah .
7084	0	a	Okay , well
7085	1	a	m maybe I should write that down .
7086	0	a	Well
7087	0	a	you are the secretary .
7088	0	a	Ruud , what is your last name ?
7089	0	a	Mielsen ,
7090	0	a	because I I was writing it down in the last
7091	0	a	Mielsen .
7092	0	a	Mielsen .
7093	0	a	Right .
7094	1	a	I put all the minutes I make into the shared folder .
7095	0	a	So if you want to have a look at it , you know where to find it .
7096	0	a	okay ,
7097	1	a	but make a s make a sub folder for it ,
7098	0	a	because it is starting to fill up already .
7099	0	a	Alright .
7100	0	a	Yeah ,
7101	0	a	that is that is
7102	1	a	if you want to do it , Sebastian .
7103	0	a	Yeah .
7104	0	a	Sure .
7105	0	a	Our BSC W
7106	0	a	The ten digits ?
7107	0	a	Yeah , I believe so .
7108	0	a	Okay ,
7109	0	a	Okay ,
7110	0	a	so so
7111	0	a	Volume .
7112	0	a	Programme .
7113	0	a	dual channel .
7114	0	a	And and do we want the ten digits ?
7115	0	a	Yeah .
7116	0	a	Yes , that is important .
7117	0	a	Well ,
7118	0	a	are are you sure ?
7119	0	a	I am not so sure .
7120	0	a	Well ,
7121	0	a	if you want to go to channel ninety
7122	0	a	and you have th that button .
7123	0	a	Yeah .
7124	0	a	Well ,
7125	0	a	that is complicated ,
7126	0	a	but is that so relevant ?
7127	0	a	Because I do not think
7128	0	a	but you should shou you should know that .
7129	0	a	I would not buy it personally .
7130	0	a	If it were so .
7131	0	a	A remote control without the ten digits .
7132	0	a	Okay ,
7133	0	a	I can imagine when
7134	0	a	I can imagine when you are when you have a satellite decoder and and you have , well , about six hundred channels , I can imagine you want this .
7135	0	a	and I think the most
7136	0	a	Just elder elder people would would buy it ,
7137	0	a	but
7138	0	a	Yep .
7139	0	a	I agree actually .
7140	0	a	Well
7141	0	a	But
7142	0	a	Yeah ,
7143	0	a	and if if we
7144	0	a	And if we are targeting at the younger audience , they will probably watch more channels than the older people .
7145	0	a	But if you are a regular TV user , and you just want to watch the the Dutch television networks , well , you can you can use about ten buttons .
7146	0	a	But we do have thirteen different Dutch channels .
7147	0	a	That is enough .
7148	0	a	The older people only use five of them .
7149	0	a	Well ,
7150	0	a	but how how often do you watch all these channels ?
7151	0	a	No , you are probably right .
7152	0	a	Often .
7153	0	a	So
7154	0	a	Well
7155	0	a	And
7156	0	a	And there are some numbers about speech recognition here that younger people would like it .
7157	0	a	Yeah .
7158	0	a	Okay .
7159	0	a	But I think these ten buttons look a bit dull .
7160	0	a	Do not you think ?
7161	0	a	The design .
7162	0	a	Well ,
7163	0	a	it depends on the on the on the looks ,
7164	0	a	on the on the
7165	1	a	You c you can d make them very fancy
7166	0	a	by
7167	0	a	I mean Nokia , they have ten digits on their phones
7168	0	a	and it still looks very fancy .
7169	0	a	On the design .
7170	0	a	Okay .
7171	0	a	Well ,
7172	0	a	y
7173	1	a	then there should be should done be done something specific with it .
7174	0	a	Yeah .
7175	0	a	So I am I am
7176	0	a	I do not agree
7177	0	a	Exactly , exactly .
7178	0	a	Okay ,
7179	0	a	so you can experiment by with with shape or with size or with colour , that kind of thing .
7180	0	a	Okay .
7181	0	a	it might be expensive and hard to implement ,
7182	1	a	but it would be a solution for
7183	0	a	Yeah .
7184	0	a	Okay ,
7185	0	a	speech .
7186	0	a	Well ,
7187	1	a	maybe it can be combined with the find the remote control .
7188	0	a	Yeah .
7189	0	a	So
7190	0	a	when you add speech recognition to your remote control , it is very easy to change the channel .
7191	0	a	Yeah .
7192	0	a	That is one thing .
7193	0	a	And it is very easy to find your remote control .
7194	0	a	To find
7195	0	a	yeah .
7196	0	a	So maybe that is a possibility ,
7197	0	a	but I am afraid it will be a bit costly .
7198	0	a	But maybe when we
7199	1	a	If if we would drop the ten digits but keep the programme and the volume ,
7200	0	a	because maybe people do not always want to use their voice ,
7201	0	a	Yeah .
7202	0	a	Okay .
7203	0	a	Okay , okay .
7204	0	a	Especially elder people do not like voice recognition .
7205	0	a	So then we should implement such a but
7206	0	a	Yes .
7207	0	a	But we do focus on younger people .
7208	0	a	We d it
7209	0	a	it is a board decision .
7210	0	a	Okay .
7211	0	a	Well .
7212	0	a	I I think it should should work , it sh we should manage that .
7213	0	a	So
7214	0	a	we have to i to make a decision between the ten digits or the voice recognition .
7215	0	a	Okay .
7216	0	a	Yes .
7217	0	a	Well ,
7218	0	a	the voice recognition has the main adva has another advantage .
7219	0	a	It is mas it makes it very easy for us to implement the find find the remote control button remote control function .
7220	0	a	So that is that is a big advantage , I think .
7221	0	a	Okay .
7222	0	a	Okay , g good .
7223	0	a	Okay .
7224	0	a	There is only one disadvantage by implementing this .
7225	0	a	the power saving power saving will be a bit more difficult .
7226	0	a	So we can expect that there will be a less longer life to the batteries .
7227	1	a	But maybe can we we can think something smart about it .
7228	0	a	Yep .
7229	0	a	There are some hybrid hybrid devices which incorporate a solar panel and rechargeable batteries .
7230	0	a	Okay .
7231	0	a	So when you just leave the device in a in a light room , it charges itself .
7232	0	a	But But but can we manage it bu for the costs ?
7233	0	a	Because it seems like a very
7234	0	a	Is a cradle very cheap ?
7235	0	a	I know ,
7236	0	a	b but there should be an adapter as well .
7237	0	a	You have to do nothing for it .
7238	0	a	M
7239	1	a	And if we if we could inc include a c a cradle in which it could recharge , then there would not be a big problem .
7240	0	a	Twelve dollar fifty .
7241	0	a	Maybe , maybe not .
7242	1	a	I will have to find that out .
7243	0	a	Yes .
7244	0	a	So
7245	0	a	No ,
7246	0	a	that is very cheap .
7247	0	a	Cause when
7248	0	a	Yeah .
7249	0	a	It is
7250	0	a	Oh ,
7251	0	a	it is very cheap .
7252	0	a	That is no problem .
7253	0	a	It is just a a case with two metal contacts .
7254	0	a	It is
7255	0	a	Yes ,
7256	0	a	but they are they are mass production .
7257	0	a	They are very cheap .
7258	0	a	So it will cost us p practically nothing .
7259	0	a	Okay .
7260	0	a	Okay .
7261	0	a	We we have about ten minutes left this meeting .
7262	0	a	I would like to hear maybe
7263	0	a	maybe you all have th things not spoken about ,
7264	0	a	yeah ,
7265	0	a	but that are important .
7266	0	a	Ruud , you you came up with the voice recognition data .
7267	0	a	are there other things about the market we should know ?
7268	0	a	Okay .
7269	0	a	I think we dealt with the most important information .
7270	0	a	Just that the younger part of the market is not the forty percent we want to sell to .
7271	1	a	So we we should for least a bit look at the older people .
7272	0	a	But with buttons like that , which are easy to use , we might attract them too .
7273	0	a	So I do not think that is a big problem
7274	0	a	Yes .
7275	0	a	Okay .
7276	0	a	Yeah .
7277	0	a	Okay , so
7278	0	a	although we are focussing on younger people to make it profitable Profitable .
7279	0	a	Profitable .
7280	0	a	Yeah , profitable .
7281	0	a	We we
7282	0	a	yeah ,
7283	0	a	we still need to take in account the the bit older people .
7284	0	a	Yes .
7285	0	a	Okay .
7286	0	a	O okay .
7287	0	a	Roo .
7288	0	a	I have nothing nothing to add , I think .
7289	0	a	Nothing to add .
7290	0	a	Sebastian ?
7291	0	a	Yeah ?
7292	0	a	Great .
7293	1	a	I just want to make a summary of all all things spoken and the different possibilities .
7294	0	a	so basically
7295	0	a	we have decided to implement a seemingly easy design .
7296	0	a	So
7297	0	a	on the outside it looks easy , but we can make it easy on the inside or elaborate on the inside .
7298	0	a	So that is one the
7299	0	a	those are the choices we have to make .
7300	0	a	But I think there is a big advantage in making it more elaborate by implementing speech techniques , voice recognition , that these kinds of things .
7301	0	a	Yeah .
7302	0	a	it makes it also more attractable , I think , to our audience .
7303	0	a	there are some advantages and some disadvantages , and the main advantage is that we can implement fancy techniques , which I think our customers will like .
7304	0	a	The disadvantage is that there are some concerns about the the costs and the things like battery lifetime , energy saving .
7305	0	a	Yep .
7306	0	a	another advantage is that the circuit board will become much more easier if we do not do not implement these buttons .
7307	0	a	If we just add a chip which does the voice recognition , our circuit board will become even more cheap .
7308	0	a	So that is another
7309	0	a	well ,
7310	0	a	it wa it w
7311	0	a	it was an issue ,
7312	0	a	but we also thought that
7313	0	a	we already thought we should do it as cheaply as possible .
7314	0	a	Yeah ,
7315	0	a	and that was the main issue ,
7316	0	a	right ?
7317	0	a	The the board
7318	0	a	Yeah .
7319	0	a	And this even makes it more cheapy .
7320	0	a	But the cheaper the ch the the chip or th what was it ?
7321	0	a	The circuit board .
7322	0	a	The board .
7323	0	a	The circuit board .
7324	0	a	The fewer buttons you can use on it .
7325	0	a	The fewer buttons you have , the ch ch the cheaper the circuit board , yes .
7326	0	a	No ,
7327	0	a	it is th
7328	0	a	yeah .
7329	0	a	Yeah , okay .
7330	0	a	It is the other way around , yeah .
7331	0	a	Yeah .
7332	0	a	And it is very cheap to incorporate an integrated circuit , a chip .
7333	0	a	So that is that is another advantage .
7334	0	a	It should not be a big issue .
7335	0	a	Well
7336	0	a	it
7337	1	a	then we should just take a look at the costs and especially for the voice recognition .
7338	0	a	So
7339	0	a	Yes ,
7340	0	a	because I do not know
7341	0	a	Yes .
7342	0	a	I d
7343	0	a	I really do not know .
7344	0	a	So
7345	0	a	It can be costly .
7346	0	a	No .
7347	0	a	Okay .
7348	0	a	Maybe not .
7349	0	a	I am not sure how how we will f determine the costs ,
7350	1	a	I will have a look at it .
7351	0	a	Maybe you will get some information on that .
7352	0	a	Yes .
7353	0	a	I am not sure how how that
7354	0	a	Yep .
7355	0	a	Yes ,
7356	0	a	I al
7357	0	a	I
7358	0	a	I hope my personal coach will have a lo look at it .
7359	0	a	Okay , great .
7360	0	a	well ,
7361	0	a	I think we are qui quite done .
7362	0	a	We are done , I think .
7363	0	a	for now we will have the lunch break .
7364	0	a	How nice .
7365	0	a	I am do not know how long the break will be , but we will find out .
7366	0	a	Me neither .
7367	0	a	then we will have thirty minutes of time to perform our individual work , and I am sure your personal coaches will assist you with it .
7368	1	a	I will put the minutes I just made in the project documents folder .
7369	0	a	If you want to look at it well , just do .
7370	0	a	the Interface Designer , I would like to the next meeting I would like to receive the components concept .
7371	0	a	I am sorry ,
7372	0	a	yeah ,
7373	0	a	I am sorry .
7374	0	a	Interface industrial .
7375	0	a	Yeah .
7376	0	a	User Interface Designer , Roo , I would like to see the user interface c concept .
7377	0	a	Well ,
7378	0	a	we understand .
7379	0	a	And Well ,
7380	0	a	i it should be easy , that is w w what we concluded .
7381	0	a	the only problem is it that it depends on the divisions the decis decisions Sebastian makes .
7382	0	a	Well
7383	0	a	yes .
7384	0	a	About the voice recognition .
7385	0	a	Well
7386	0	a	Yeah .
7387	0	a	It should be an easy interface with not so much buttons .
7388	0	a	S just a a p a p a volume and a programme one .
7389	0	a	And yeah , some some fancy lights .
7390	0	a	I think that is what we decided .
7391	0	a	So we drop the voice recognition ?
7392	0	a	Or
7393	0	a	Oh .
7394	0	a	No no
7395	0	a	no , we did not
7396	1	a	but it should not be integrated
7397	0	a	yeah ,
7398	0	a	it is of course it is user interface , but i I was talking about really the design of the
7399	0	a	No .
7400	0	a	Okay .
7401	0	a	Well
7402	0	a	do we really have to decide now or can we decide next meeting ?
7403	0	a	Okay .
7404	0	a	We can decide the next meeting .
7405	0	a	Yep .
7406	0	a	Because I will have some updated info on that Adapt .
7407	0	a	Yeah .
7408	0	a	I guess all of you have i updated info .
7409	0	a	I am sure the marketing expert will receive t you will do some trend watching .
7410	0	a	Yep .
7411	0	a	And I am sure the market will will change , adapt
7412	0	a	and so
7413	0	a	we will see that .
7414	0	a	Adapt .
7415	0	a	Left .
7416	0	a	yeah ,
7417	0	a	that is it for now .
7418	0	a	That is it .
7419	0	a	Kay .
7420	0	a	Any other questions
7421	0	a	or can we have the lunch ?
7422	0	a	Yeah , okay .
7423	0	a	 
7424	0	a	Do you need to change anything on it ?
7425	1	a	Because otherwise I will already open it .
7426	0	a	, do not think so .
7427	0	a	Okay .
7428	0	a	Unless things have suddenly change again .
7429	0	a	Is it much changes ?
7430	0	a	I did not
7431	0	a	No no .
7432	0	a	do not know .
7433	0	a	Maybe you have got new information , like last time .
7434	0	a	I do hot have Only the same information .
7435	0	a	Okay .
7436	0	a	Hello , Sebastian .
7437	0	a	Hello hello Mister PM .
7438	0	a	I believe Miss Tentel is with us as well , in the control room .
7439	0	a	Well ,
7440	0	a	that is where the thinking goes on .
7441	0	a	Oh ,
7442	0	a	it is that Roo again , always late .
7443	0	a	Bongiorno .
7444	0	a	Bongiorno .
7445	0	a	I think you should punish him .
7446	0	a	You are the PM .
7447	0	a	Punish .
7448	0	a	I see some interesting
7449	0	a	okay .
7450	0	a	Possibilities , yeah ?
7451	0	a	Yes .
7452	0	a	You wish .
7453	0	a	People , welcome back .
7454	0	a	Welcome .
7455	0	a	The third meeting .
7456	0	a	Yeah .
7457	0	a	Oop .
7458	1	a	I have some points I would like to some some issues I would like to point out .
7459	0	a	first of all , if you make minutes yourself as well , like Sebastian does , could you put them on the shared folder ?
7460	0	a	If you do not make minutes , no problem ,
7461	0	a	but it is easy for me to see what you wrote down ,
7462	1	a	so I could can use that in the in the report .
7463	0	a	the second thing , I was th s thinking to myself , I have this little remote control , and I am talking to it ,
7464	0	a	but I still need to point to the television , because it works with infrared .
7465	0	a	That is quite strange .
7466	0	a	Okay .
7467	0	a	So
7468	0	a	Not at all .
7469	1	a	We will come to that later ,
7470	1	a	I g I think .
7471	0	a	the agenda for now
7472	0	a	are there any pre discussion questions ?
7473	0	a	Okay .
7474	0	a	No .
7475	0	a	No .
7476	0	a	we wi we will have your individual presentations , then the decision on the remote control concept , and the closing .
7477	0	a	Forty minutes in total for this .
7478	0	a	So
7479	1	a	I think we we can immedis immediately start with the individual presentations , the progress you have made .
7480	0	a	Okay .
7481	1	a	I think it might be smart to look at Ruud is information first ,
7482	0	a	because I understood there are some significant changes in the market situation .
7483	0	a	Kay .
7484	0	a	Oh .
7485	0	a	Alright .
7486	1	a	Just press the okay button , it works .
7487	0	a	Yeah ,
7488	0	a	Okay .
7489	0	a	yeah .
7490	0	a	Yeah .
7491	0	a	Yeah .
7492	0	a	My method ?
7493	0	a	Well ,
7494	0	a	findings .
7495	0	a	How surprising .
7496	0	a	Ease of use is important , but innovation is more important , and a fancy look and feel is even more important .
7497	0	a	And some fashion watchers have found out that the young target group likes fruit and vegetables in their clothes , shoes and furniture , and that they want spongy material .
7498	0	a	Probably watch too much Sponge Bob .
7499	0	a	the older group still prefers dark colours .
7500	0	a	Simple shapes m material .
7501	0	a	But we since we are concentrating on the younger group
7502	0	a	Kay .
7503	1	a	w wait a sec wait a se
7504	0	a	could you go to the previous slide ?
7505	0	a	because I am taking minutes
7506	0	a	were the important themes enclose .
7507	1	a	Oh wait wait up .
7508	0	a	Yeah
7509	0	a	okay .
7510	0	a	The feel of to be spongy
7511	0	a	Okay , so so , yeah ,
7512	0	a	it might not be t it
7513	1	a	it should not be too hard .
7514	0	a	so do you think when fruit and vegetables are important for clothing and shoes that they are in remote controls also ?
7515	0	a	Not something dull .
7516	0	a	Well ,
7517	0	a	one example given was this ,
7518	0	a	so
7519	0	a	I assume they just want something colourful .
7520	0	a	Not specifically an apple as a remote control or something .
7521	0	a	Okay .
7522	0	a	But they like dark colours ,
7523	0	a	you said in the p
7524	0	a	Okay .
7525	0	a	No , the younger group likes more colourful objects .
7526	0	a	Well
7527	0	a	then I suggest that
7528	0	a	the corporate colours are grey and yellow .
7529	0	a	But
7530	0	a	Which one ?
7531	0	a	This ?
7532	0	a	Yes .
7533	0	a	I had
7534	0	a	Or we could make oh .
7535	0	a	But can you can you go back to that slide ?
7536	0	a	The
7537	0	a	just one slide back , no no no .
7538	0	a	Yes .
7539	0	a	Okay ,
7540	0	a	and the feel of the material has to be spongy .
7541	0	a	Has it something to do with that natural feeling also , do you think ?
7542	0	a	Okay .
7543	0	a	well ,
7544	0	a	it might .
7545	0	a	But personally I would not like a sponge as a remote control .
7546	0	a	But
7547	0	a	Maybe soft material or something .
7548	0	a	But not a real sponge .
7549	0	a	It it
7550	1	a	maybe it rubber
7551	0	a	or or
7552	0	a	yeah .
7553	0	a	Yeah , exactly .
7554	0	a	Okay .
7555	0	a	Yeah ,
7556	0	a	and like the older group likes familiar materials , but that does not mean we should use wood ,
7557	0	a	So
7558	0	a	Well ,
7559	0	a	this this is an example of what they would like .
7560	0	a	But since we are conten concentrating on the younger group ,
7561	1	a	I think we should use soft materials and make it colourful or like cell phones , exch exchangeable covers .
7562	0	a	Yeah .
7563	0	a	So we could provide both for the young and the old what they like .
7564	0	a	Well ,
7565	0	a	that is interesting .
7566	0	a	It is quite interesting .
7567	1	a	You could make a few v very colourful ones , and a very traditional co cover .
7568	0	a	Yeah ,
7569	0	a	o o
7570	0	a	I am thinking about the Bananarama telephone telephone from Siemens .
7571	0	a	Yes .
7572	0	a	The yellow rubber telephone .
7573	0	a	Yeah ,
7574	0	a	yeah .
7575	0	a	It is the it is the rubber cover .
7576	0	a	Yeah , it is , it is i
7577	0	a	yeah .
7578	0	a	And it is colourful .
7579	0	a	It looks likes a banana .
7580	0	a	Yeah .
7581	0	a	We have the fruit , we have the colours .
7582	0	a	Do you know the phone ?
7583	0	a	It is the Siemens C twenty five , I believe it is it is the one the Post bank gave away ,
7584	0	a	the very
7585	0	a	You kn you know , Ruud , as well ?
7586	0	a	About th
7587	0	a	Okay .
7588	0	a	We have the simple design .
7589	0	a	I do not know the phone , but I can imagine it .
7590	0	a	thirty five .
7591	0	a	Oh , that one , yes .
7592	0	a	And the b
7593	0	a	the light blue and it is also in yellow .
7594	0	a	Now I kn
7595	0	a	oh , I know , I know .
7596	0	a	Yes ,
7597	0	a	I I have seen it .
7598	0	a	I have seen it .
7599	0	a	I have seen it ,
7600	0	a	but
7601	0	a	Kay .
7602	0	a	Okay .
7603	0	a	okay .
7604	0	a	Do you have thit that was
7605	0	a	Okay .
7606	0	a	that is about it .
7607	0	a	Okay , so
7608	0	a	the the m important findings are innovation is more important than ease of use for the our target group .
7609	0	a	Yes .
7610	0	a	And colouring is important and and soft materials .
7611	0	a	soft material .
7612	0	a	Okay .
7613	0	a	So So
7614	0	a	ease of use is important , but technology is twice as important .
7615	0	a	And what was even more important ?
7616	0	a	Okay .
7617	0	a	the fancy look and feel .
7618	0	a	So
7619	0	a	that is the most important thing for our customers .
7620	0	a	Yes .
7621	0	a	Apparently .
7622	0	a	Okay ,
7623	0	a	Roo ,
7624	0	a	could you do your presentation ?
7625	0	a	Okay , well
7626	0	a	it is good to to sum up the things we already thought about .
7627	0	a	Yeah .
7628	0	a	Well ,
7629	0	a	I do not ha really have much to add , because most of things we already said in the previous discussion .
7630	0	a	the previous ideas were voice recognition and the round button for the p channel programming and volume .
7631	0	a	Well ,
7632	0	a	a few interface I I found on the internet are are these .
7633	0	a	These are both with with voice recognition , but they are very advanced and very high tech and just , well , a weird shape .
7634	0	a	Shape .
7635	0	a	So I suggest I could not
7636	0	a	I had a small mock up sign on the on paper .
7637	0	a	But it did not work .
7638	0	a	My pen did not load the information .
7639	0	a	So I made a really simple f a shape on in PowerPoint .
7640	1	a	But we could make a round an oval remote control .
7641	0	a	But it is it is kind of it is kind of o organic ,
7642	0	a	so that is very good .
7643	1	a	yellow .
7644	0	a	Yeah .
7645	0	a	Yeah .
7646	1	a	And what I am thinking about , maybe we should make very light but a grip
7647	0	a	I mean this is how you hold a remote control .
7648	0	a	Yes .
7649	1	a	it should not be too glatt , too slippery ,
7650	0	a	s because
7651	0	a	Yeah .
7652	0	a	Slippery .
7653	0	a	But if you have something like the Siemens phone , it is rubber .
7654	0	a	You have to grab it .
7655	0	a	So it is easy in your hand indeed .
7656	0	a	Yeah , exactly .
7657	0	a	Yeah .
7658	0	a	Yes .
7659	0	a	There are there are also remote controls who have a little shape underneath where you can put your fingers in , so you can get a really good grip on it .
7660	0	a	Yeah , ex for your fingers , yeah .
7661	0	a	Yeah .
7662	0	a	So you you do not have to attain much pressure to it .
7663	0	a	It is it is a lot easier .
7664	0	a	Yeah .
7665	0	a	So
7666	0	a	m
7667	0	a	Yes .
7668	0	a	It grips automatically .
7669	0	a	Yeah ,
7670	1	a	okay .
7671	1	a	But I will I will go into that deeper in my presentation .
7672	0	a	Okay , good .
7673	0	a	Great .
7674	0	a	Oh and
7675	1	a	to add on Ruud is information ,
7676	0	a	in this interface we can have high tech with the voice recognition and , well , the the fancy colours and and so on , and still have the ease of use , because we have an easy interface .
7677	0	a	And all the other remote controls are high tech in buttons and and so on .
7678	0	a	Yeah .
7679	0	a	Way too much
7680	0	a	I think for our goal ,
7681	0	a	yeah .
7682	0	a	Yeah .
7683	0	a	So if you have the voice recognition , you can you can programme like thirty thirty c controls on it .
7684	0	a	Okay ,
7685	0	a	b
7686	0	a	but I think we will
7687	0	a	yeah .
7688	0	a	Okay ,
7689	1	a	but I will I will go into that ,
7690	0	a	because there are are some possibilities and some impossibilities .
7691	0	a	I had a talk with our manufacturing division , and we had a talk about all the different components who are in this design .
7692	0	a	these are the things we have looked at .
7693	0	a	And of course I used the web to find my information .
7694	0	a	About the casing , we have three different casing possibilities .
7695	0	a	We have the uncurved or flat case .
7696	0	a	that is the most common remote con control form we are used to is just a it ju
7697	0	a	it is just a box .
7698	0	a	I am sorry
7699	0	a	I
7700	0	a	I do not have any pictures of of this thing .
7701	0	a	We have a curved one .
7702	0	a	It is curved in two dimensions .
7703	0	a	You have to imagine it is a bit like a wave form .
7704	0	a	So it is a little more advanced in its in its shape .
7705	0	a	Okay .
7706	0	a	and we have an even more advanced shape , which is curved in three dimension .
7707	0	a	I c
7708	0	a	I think you can compare it a little bit with the big grey image you had in your presentation .
7709	0	a	Yeah .
7710	0	a	The the big remote control , something like that .
7711	0	a	Right .
7712	0	a	But it is quite advanced and it is it is quite daring to to use I think .
7713	0	a	for these casings we have different types of finishing .
7714	0	a	We can use plastic , which is very slippery and maybe not so nice , but you can give it any colour , which is the same for rubber , but it is not slippery .
7715	0	a	We can use wood and titanium .
7716	0	a	Well ,
7717	0	a	we cannot use the titanium on the double curve cases .
7718	0	a	And these latex cases , there is there is just the plastic ones wo not allow the use of solar cells as an energy source source .
7719	1	a	Which brings me to the different energy sources .
7720	0	a	well ,
7721	0	a	we even seem to have hand dyn dynamos for powering our remote controls .
7722	0	a	You really have to imagine like winding up your
7723	0	a	I d
7724	0	a	It would be very new ,
7725	0	a	but it is a kind of a retro style , I think .
7726	0	a	Great .
7727	0	a	Well ,
7728	0	a	it would be very new to the market ,
7729	0	a	but
7730	0	a	Yeah .
7731	0	a	Well ,
7732	0	a	this is quite interesting .
7733	0	a	there is there is also a kinetic energy supply .
7734	0	a	So
7735	0	a	when you are watching TV or when you are you you have to make some kind of energy kinetic energy by shaking the remote or throwing it against the wall , whatever you wish .
7736	0	a	Like the watch .
7737	0	a	It have it
7738	0	a	it has to move , that is the the sense of it .
7739	0	a	And you can store the energy in the in the thing .
7740	0	a	I think , if if I can hook on to that , the kinetic thing is very funny .
7741	0	a	It is very funny indeed .
7742	0	a	I mean solar is of course
7743	0	a	it is nice ,
7744	0	a	but it is , well , your your calculator has a solar panel .
7745	0	a	Indeed .
7746	0	a	hand dynamo
7747	0	a	Well ,
7748	0	a	maybe m
7749	0	a	Yeah , I know .
7750	0	a	But if you are watching a movie , how many times you take the the remote control and and
7751	0	a	if if you have a watch ,
7752	0	a	you have the kinetic idea in a watch also .
7753	0	a	You you walk
7754	0	a	and but
7755	0	a	you you are sitting on a couch .
7756	0	a	Yes .
7757	0	a	Yeah .
7758	0	a	But you know you know from your own watch your watch uses a minimal con it consumes a minimal amount of energy .
7759	0	a	the the shaking of your body , which is almost every activity makes your body shake , it charges it .
7760	0	a	But the problem here is that it it supplies a a very little amount of kinetic energy .
7761	0	a	So I think you have a problem when you are watching a movie
7762	0	a	and you have not moved the remote
7763	0	a	i remote control in a in an amount of time , and you want t to switch the channel or something ,
7764	0	a	well ,
7765	0	a	m
7766	0	a	it might not work .
7767	0	a	Yeah .
7768	0	a	And wha
7769	0	a	Okay .
7770	1	a	So that is something you have to keep in mind .
7771	0	a	So ,
7772	1	a	but maybe maybe there is a possibility com to combine it with m traditional batteries ,
7773	0	a	so we can save on the batteries
7774	1	a	and when there is enough kinet kinetic energy , use the kinetic energy , and otherwise use the batteries .
7775	0	a	Yeah .
7776	0	a	Okay ,
7777	0	a	because I guess the voice recognition feature u consumes quite a f a lot of power .
7778	0	a	yes , it does .
7779	0	a	Yeah .
7780	1	a	I will come to that later .
7781	0	a	Okay .
7782	0	a	And we of course have the traditional solar power , which is just a piece of material on the remote control which transfers light energy into electricity .
7783	0	a	The user interface controls , of course we have the push buttons and we also have scroll wheels .
7784	0	a	And these scroll wheels can also be integrated with buttons .
7785	0	a	So it is just like a mouse .
7786	0	a	You can scroll them , you can also push it .
7787	0	a	in the indicators we have the LCD displays , which means you can watch in a display w which channel you have chosen or something like that of the li amount of volume which is currently and we also have double scroll buttons , which are just two of these things .
7788	0	a	So we do not really have the the kind of button we had in mind in our in our last meeting , the the thing with the the round with the four
7789	0	a	Yes .
7790	0	a	Oh ,
7791	1	a	we can just make four push buttons in a form of a round .
7792	0	a	That is possible too .
7793	0	a	Yes .
7794	0	a	But I th I do not think
7795	0	a	the scroll wheels I had some
7796	0	a	I had some information about it too .
7797	0	a	I do not think there is any possibility for us to use scroll wheels .
7798	0	a	Well
7799	0	a	This will be the remote ,
7800	0	a	right ?
7801	0	a	with maybe a channel selector .
7802	0	a	I d
7803	0	a	I ca not see any scenario where you would use a scroll wheel with a button on it .
7804	0	a	Well ,
7805	0	a	mayb
7806	0	a	well ,
7807	0	a	m me neither .
7808	0	a	Maybe when you integrate some functions .
7809	0	a	Yeah .
7810	0	a	What about integrating a scroll bar on this side ?
7811	0	a	Because this is how you keep it Volume ?
7812	0	a	Well ,
7813	0	a	what about mute ?
7814	0	a	Thi i
7815	0	a	i
7816	0	a	m
7817	0	a	I guess th
7818	1	a	this is my volume button .
7819	0	a	Yeah , that is a possibility ,
7820	0	a	but
7821	0	a	But Flores , think about a scenario where y where you would use the scroll button for
7822	0	a	A
7823	0	a	volume , okay .
7824	0	a	it is do it is done before .
7825	0	a	Yes .
7826	0	a	It is quite quite good , yes .
7827	0	a	Well ,
7828	0	a	it is it
7829	0	a	well ,
7830	0	a	i
7831	0	a	what he means is there is an button integrated in the scroll wheel .
7832	0	a	There is no scenario where you use the button in the scroll wheel .
7833	0	a	You just use the wheel .
7834	0	a	About mute .
7835	0	a	Well ,
7836	0	a	yes .
7837	0	a	Okay .
7838	0	a	Yes .
7839	1	a	And I can either on this side or this side
7840	1	a	And click it to muten the device .
7841	0	a	Well ,
7842	0	a	okay .
7843	0	a	Well ,
7844	0	a	that that that is one possibility , okay .
7845	0	a	Well ,
7846	0	a	okay .
7847	0	a	And and it makes it different from the traditional devices on this market .
7848	0	a	It is quite goods .
7849	0	a	So
7850	1	a	I am looking for a way to make it a little different than the traditional ones .
7851	0	a	Yes .
7852	1	a	So maybe I guess that that is something you two need to think about .
7853	0	a	Yeah .
7854	0	a	Ruud , wha what do you thing about a scroll bar ?
7855	0	a	scroll wheel .
7856	0	a	well ,
7857	0	a	it is obvious obviously new .
7858	0	a	Wheel .
7859	0	a	So it might attract the young customers .
7860	0	a	Okay .
7861	0	a	But it is done before , there are many other devices like telephones and our radio , pocket radios .
7862	0	a	We use this .
7863	0	a	Yeah .
7864	0	a	And Well ,
7865	0	a	it is it is been done years ago
7866	0	a	and I do not see it anywhere now .
7867	0	a	So maybe it is not no .
7868	0	a	Well ,
7869	0	a	all the Sony telephones use it , for example , for volume .
7870	0	a	Nokia has a well , okay , it is not really a scroll wheel , but on their side th the the volume button is on the side , because you gri grab it like this .
7871	0	a	Yes ,
7872	0	a	but it uses two separate buttons .
7873	0	a	Yeah .
7874	0	a	I know , it is not really a scroll wheel .
7875	0	a	It does not use a .
7876	0	a	No .
7877	0	a	Yeah .
7878	0	a	Well .
7879	1	a	something for Roo here .
7880	1	a	For you too ,
7881	0	a	yeah .
7882	0	a	Yeah ,
7883	0	a	I believe if you have what we have earlier said , the grip places in in the remote control .
7884	0	a	You have your hand on one place on the remote control , so you have to place all the buttons in a range of your thumb .
7885	0	a	Wi within reach .
7886	0	a	Yes , you have to .
7887	0	a	So in that case the volume button on the side of the remote control would be perfect .
7888	0	a	Yes .
7889	0	a	yes .
7890	0	a	Yeah ,
7891	0	a	yeah .
7892	0	a	Okay .
7893	0	a	Okay .
7894	1	a	Sebastian .
7895	0	a	Yeah .
7896	0	a	Okay ,
7897	0	a	we have to know ,
7898	0	a	if you want to use these rubber double curved c case , you must use these push push buttons .
7899	0	a	There is no way you can integrate LCD displays .
7900	0	a	There is no way you can integrate scroll wheels , because it is all curved .
7901	0	a	There is there are no flat areas where you can incorporate these things .
7902	0	a	So that is a limitation .
7903	1	a	About the components , just the hardware .
7904	0	a	We basically have three types of chips we can use and these chips incorporate all the Logica and hardware that is needed to send to send a signal .
7905	0	a	we have a simple , regular and advanced chip .
7906	0	a	And there is something like a sample sensor and sample speaker , which is a little cryptic to me .
7907	0	a	But I think that is the the voice recognition thing that we are thinking about .
7908	0	a	Yeah yeah ,
7909	0	a	you can
7910	0	a	I have some information about it .
7911	0	a	in the voice recognition you say a word you can programme words like v volume up .
7912	0	a	Okay .
7913	0	a	Okay .
7914	0	a	So so
7915	0	a	okay .
7916	0	a	Of mute , let is say mute .
7917	0	a	you programme it , you m mute and you
7918	0	a	g you give an an action to it that that is really the mute function and when you speak in the the remote control , it repeats your saying .
7919	0	a	Yeah .
7920	0	a	So
7921	0	a	that is the sample sensor .
7922	0	a	Okay .
7923	0	a	So if you say mute , it says mute again , and then it is well ,
7924	0	a	I believe it is
7925	0	a	Yeah ,
7926	0	a	and then he he repeats its action what which he believes it is .
7927	0	a	It performs the action .
7928	0	a	Yeah .
7929	0	a	Okay .
7930	0	a	So you say mute , he repeats mute and you makes a computer sound mute , and then goes to the mute function .
7931	0	a	Yeah .
7932	0	a	Okay .
7933	0	a	Okay ,
7934	0	a	so that is basically the the voice recognition item we were searching for .
7935	0	a	Okay .
7936	0	a	This sample sensor requires an regular chip , I thought .
7937	0	a	no op I am not very sure .
7938	0	a	No , it is not in here .
7939	0	a	If we want to use the LCD display , we really need the advanced version , which is a bit l little bit more costly .
7940	0	a	If we want to use the scroll wheels we need the regular version .
7941	0	a	And if we do not want to use any of these more advanced functions we can keep with the simple chip , which is a bit cheaper .
7942	0	a	Okay .
7943	0	a	well
7944	0	a	d did we already decide on the display ?
7945	0	a	To
7946	0	a	No .
7947	0	a	Okay .
7948	0	a	no ,
7949	1	a	but I think that is something for Roo here to think about .
7950	0	a	Yeah .
7951	0	a	Well ,
7952	0	a	I do not have
7953	0	a	I have not looked for for information about it ,
7954	0	a	but I do not think information
7955	1	a	y I do not think you need it on a display .
7956	0	a	Especially when when we have to look at a cost , I do not think cause all any TV can can view a digit on on screen ,
7957	0	a	yeah .
7958	0	a	I I do not think either .
7959	0	a	No .
7960	0	a	I do not think you need it .
7961	0	a	On screen display .
7962	0	a	Yeah .
7963	0	a	Okay .
7964	1	a	Okay
7965	0	a	th
7966	0	a	Okay .
7967	0	a	Okay , well
7968	0	a	my conclusion , unfortunately the market has decided the a little other than I thought .
7969	0	a	I thought the market would like a sort m sort of titanium casing , but they seem to like natural stuff .
7970	1	a	So maybe we should think about wood finish .
7971	1	a	I have chosen the more battery with solar cell solution for the energy .
7972	0	a	It is more reliable , it is cheaper .
7973	1	a	So I do not think we should use the dynamo thing .
7974	0	a	Good .
7975	0	a	Kineti
7976	0	a	okay .
7977	0	a	The kinetic thing it it is it is a possibility .
7978	0	a	It is it is more advanced ,
7979	1	a	but I am
7980	1	a	I think you should combine it with batteries .
7981	0	a	Okay ,
7982	0	a	it is maybe a bit too too flashy ,
7983	0	a	too
7984	0	a	yeah .
7985	0	a	Otherwise it will not too advanced ,
7986	0	a	well .
7987	0	a	It is in in in some way it can give us an advance , because you will save on your batteries .
7988	0	a	But
7989	0	a	Yes .
7990	0	a	Yeah ,
7991	0	a	but that that is the same with the solar cell .
7992	0	a	That is no different .
7993	0	a	And I think it is more robust .
7994	0	a	It is more it is more functional .
7995	0	a	Yeah .
7996	0	a	Okay .
7997	0	a	But what about the markets wants colourfuls designs ?
7998	0	a	So if you use titanium
7999	0	a	Okay .
8000	0	a	No no ,
8001	0	a	but the that is what Sebastian said .
8002	0	a	The titanium thing we have to skip it .
8003	0	a	He said this is what this is my personal preference .
8004	0	a	But but yet , I understood that the market is different .
8005	0	a	Oh ,
8006	0	a	sorry .
8007	0	a	Yeah .
8008	0	a	So
8009	0	a	No ,
8010	0	a	r
8011	1	a	rubber with colours .
8012	0	a	So
8013	1	a	I think we should skip the titanium stuff , and we should use wood or something like that .
8014	0	a	Yeah .
8015	0	a	And
8016	0	a	yeah ,
8017	0	a	the
8018	0	a	yeah ,
8019	0	a	the older people liked wood .
8020	0	a	And I would think
8021	0	a	And they can be implemented with a regular chip ?
8022	0	a	Okay ,
8023	0	a	but we also
8024	0	a	we already need the regular chip for the sample sensor speaker
8025	0	a	oh ,
8026	0	a	evalu
8027	0	a	But most infrared remote controls do not have to be pointed at all .
8028	0	a	Oh okay ,
8029	0	a	sorry .
8030	0	a	So it it needs to be rubber .
8031	0	a	No the
8032	0	a	Yeah ,
8033	0	a	the younger people liked soft material .
8034	1	a	Colourful
8035	0	a	and
8036	0	a	Yeah .
8037	0	a	Okay .
8038	0	a	Okay , spongy materials .
8039	0	a	Yeah .
8040	0	a	Okay , well
8041	1	a	these scroll wheels , I think they they can be they can be handy .
8042	0	a	So
8043	0	a	Yes , they can .
8044	0	a	But they really need the regular chip , you cannot use the sa simple
8045	0	a	Well ,
8046	0	a	I am not very sure .
8047	0	a	Maybe that is an a different
8048	0	a	I think so , if you if you stick with the the simple straight forward not curve design , i it is too dull .
8049	0	a	But but do we want the curved design ,
8050	0	a	or I
8051	0	a	it is too dull .
8052	0	a	Yeah .
8053	0	a	Yeah .
8054	0	a	I do not think c our customers will like it .
8055	0	a	And if you take the double curved , then you cannot you can only use the rubber buttons and you cannot use the scroll wheels .
8056	0	a	Yeah .
8057	0	a	So I think this is the best of two worlds .
8058	0	a	Okay .
8059	0	a	Okay .
8060	0	a	Okay ,
8061	0	a	what about the issue I addressed at the beginning of the meeting ?
8062	0	a	the voice function w with the infrared issue .
8063	0	a	Yes .
8064	0	a	Because it it is of cour
8065	0	a	Yeah .
8066	0	a	It is it is I
8067	0	a	I can imagine it is very dull to talk to a device
8068	0	a	w if you have to point to another device .
8069	0	a	It is very unlogical .
8070	0	a	Well
8071	0	a	the
8072	0	a	there has to be some pointing at .
8073	0	a	Well
8074	0	a	It depends also on your on your
8075	0	a	Well ,
8076	0	a	it depends on your walls actually .
8077	0	a	But
8078	0	a	All lights get absorbed ,
8079	0	a	yeah .
8080	0	a	Well ,
8081	0	a	if you if you take your hand before it ,
8082	0	a	okay , it wo not work , but you can point it just to the other wall .
8083	0	a	If you have have smooth walls , it it
8084	0	a	it
8085	0	a	probably you are probably right .
8086	0	a	Yeah .
8087	0	a	But if you have carpets on the wall , which our natural loving friends probably do have , then yeah , th th it might be a bit more of a issue .
8088	0	a	Yes ,
8089	0	a	because the walls they they reflect the infrared light .
8090	0	a	So
8091	0	a	Yeah .
8092	0	a	So it has an
8093	0	a	it is easier .
8094	1	a	I suggest we use the the sensor sample .
8095	1	a	the sample sensor and sample speaker .
8096	1	a	with a with a regular chip .
8097	1	a	And the regular chip .
8098	0	a	I think it gives us the advantage of
8099	0	a	Yes , yes .
8100	1	a	And and the scroll scroll wheels .
8101	0	a	Yeah .
8102	0	a	I like the scroll wheels idea .
8103	1	a	And skip and skip the LCD part .
8104	0	a	Yeah .
8105	0	a	I do not think it it is any value added thing .
8106	0	a	No .
8107	0	a	So
8108	0	a	Okay .
8109	0	a	Think so too .
8110	0	a	Well ,
8111	0	a	it looks
8112	0	a	yeah , well
8113	0	a	according to Ruud , the the the market likes new flashy technology ,
8114	0	a	and I mean LCD is
8115	0	a	well ,
8116	0	a	ok I know ,
8117	0	a	but it is m
8118	0	a	it is
8119	0	a	less s standard
8120	0	a	than than
8121	0	a	Well ,
8122	0	a	we are not very w
8123	0	a	we do not know much about the the f the financial part .
8124	0	a	Technology .
8125	0	a	Yes .
8126	0	a	It is not very flashy and new .
8127	0	a	Standard ?
8128	0	a	Nah , n no , I do not think so .
8129	0	a	That is the problem .
8130	1	a	Because if we do have enough space in in our finance , I would say do integrate it ,
8131	0	a	because it it adds a little ext extra high tech feeling to it .
8132	0	a	Yes .
8133	0	a	But we already have the scroll wheels , the sp the speaker the speak recognition , the rubber , the fancy colours .
8134	0	a	yeah .
8135	0	a	I think our customers will go insane .
8136	0	a	Okay , okay .
8137	0	a	It is it is too much .
8138	0	a	Yeah .
8139	0	a	Okay , I I agree .
8140	0	a	I think i
8141	0	a	Ruud , do you have any anything you would like to add or or maybe thoughts
8142	0	a	or
8143	0	a	No ?
8144	0	a	Sebast
8145	0	a	nee ,
8146	0	a	Roo ?
8147	0	a	Roo , do you have any other
8148	0	a	Nothing more .
8149	0	a	M
8150	0	a	no .
8151	0	a	Nothing more .
8152	0	a	Sebas
8153	0	a	Well ,
8154	1	a	we we need to describe decisions now .
8155	0	a	Okay .
8156	0	a	the n the next phase will be the not the
8157	0	a	what is the next phase
8158	0	a	f Flores ?
8159	0	a	Okay .
8160	0	a	So
8161	0	a	on the energy , well , we decided .
8162	0	a	So i
8163	0	a	Okay .
8164	0	a	Chip .
8165	0	a	Okay .
8166	0	a	The case rubber with c one one one curve .
8167	0	a	Okay , okay .
8168	0	a	User interface
8169	0	a	then the corporate identity should be in the product .
8170	0	a	but ca not scroll wheels work with one one curved case ?
8171	0	a	Yeah , okay .
8172	0	a	Yes , they can work .
8173	0	a	Sorry ,
8174	0	a	yeah .
8175	0	a	They cannot work with double curved .
8176	0	a	Oh ,
8177	0	a	sorry .
8178	0	a	That is that is problem .
8179	0	a	Yeah .
8180	1	a	I will check it for you .
8181	1	a	I guess that is something for Roo and Sebastian .
8182	0	a	you talked about it before , the colours , grey and yellow .
8183	0	a	Yeah .
8184	1	a	Keep it in mind .
8185	0	a	And the buttons , well we talked about it now .
8186	0	a	The next phase , Sebastian , is the design of the look and feel .
8187	0	a	Yes .
8188	0	a	The user interface design .
8189	0	a	And for you , the product evaluation .
8190	0	a	I am sure your personal coach will give you more information on that .
8191	0	a	and the ID and the UID need to work together on the prototype drawing on the SMARTboard .
8192	0	a	Okay .
8193	0	a	And I am going to plan my holidays .
8194	0	a	Okay .
8195	0	a	So you will be on the Bahamas .
8196	0	a	The project drawing is for the next
8197	0	a	Yeah , right .
8198	0	a	Okay .
8199	0	a	Yeah ,
8200	0	a	it is it is
8201	0	a	when we come back in thirty minutes , you will have a prototype ready .
8202	0	a	So
8203	0	a	can you give us a summary of all decisions we have made ?
8204	1	a	I will do .
8205	0	a	Yeah ?
8206	0	a	I can .
8207	1	a	maybe one of you could write it down .
8208	0	a	Great .
8209	1	a	you you need to help me .
8210	0	a	The casing is curved , single curved .
8211	0	a	Okay .
8212	0	a	W
8213	1	a	start with the casing .
8214	0	a	Single curved .
8215	0	a	Okay , single curved case .
8216	0	a	Okay .
8217	0	a	What about the energy source ?
8218	0	a	I I think they can .
8219	0	a	Traditional batteries and solar .
8220	0	a	But can there be wor can they work together ?
8221	0	a	Or do we have to choose between them ?
8222	0	a	Cause if we have to choose
8223	0	a	yeah ?
8224	0	a	Okay .
8225	0	a	No , they can be complementary .
8226	0	a	al al I
8227	0	a	Every device
8228	0	a	Yeah .
8229	0	a	Yes .
8230	0	a	Well ,
8231	0	a	It it should be .
8232	1	a	What if not ?
8233	0	a	Okay .
8234	0	a	There should be really no problem .
8235	0	a	They can be supplementary .
8236	0	a	That is no problem .
8237	0	a	So
8238	0	a	So
8239	0	a	just the energy source is the batteries and the solar .
8240	0	a	Okay ,
8241	0	a	th
8242	0	a	Battery and solar , yeah .
8243	0	a	Okay .
8244	0	a	What about the finishing of the case ?
8245	0	a	We have decided we wanted to use the rubber ?
8246	0	a	Okay ,
8247	1	a	and I think we should use the company colours .
8248	0	a	Yeah , with colourful rubber .
8249	0	a	Yeah .
8250	0	a	if it is possible with different covers , but I am not sure if our suppliers can can help us with with such a wish .
8251	1	a	Something like black and red .
8252	1	a	black and yellow .
8253	0	a	grey and yellow or black and yellow .
8254	0	a	Grey and yellow .
8255	0	a	Grey yellow , okay .
8256	0	a	Yeah .
8257	1	a	Yellow case and grey buttons , I think .
8258	0	a	Yeah , although I do not think that is very colourful .
8259	0	a	Except for the yellow of course ,
8260	0	a	but I could think of a more attractive c set of colours .
8261	0	a	Oh ,
8262	0	a	I think it is it is not very dull .
8263	0	a	It is quite modern actually .
8264	0	a	Do not you think ?
8265	0	a	Well ,
8266	1	a	I was more thinking about the fruit colours that the Ruud showed us before .
8267	0	a	I believe the But you have already
8268	0	a	you must have a red on and off button .
8269	0	a	And
8270	0	a	Well well Well ,
8271	0	a	there is .
8272	0	a	Well ,
8273	0	a	it it does not have to be red .
8274	0	a	I mean th
8275	0	a	I think these colours are really what our young people are looking for .
8276	0	a	so maybe it should not even be two colours ,
8277	1	a	it should be a full colour cover with such an image
8278	0	a	or or
8279	0	a	I mean thinking in two colours is is too black and white for our m c market group , I guess .
8280	0	a	Okay .
8281	0	a	Or black and yellow .
8282	0	a	Black and yellow , yeah .
8283	0	a	Okay ,
8284	0	a	but I am afraid it is not possible to print a picture on the device .
8285	0	a	Because I agree it would be nice to have have something like that on the device itself .
8286	0	a	But
8287	0	a	Oh ,
8288	0	a	I have read .
8289	0	a	Just a week ago , a keyboard manufacturer would print ,
8290	0	a	with and
8291	0	a	No .
8292	0	a	Yeah .
8293	0	a	Yes .
8294	0	a	Yes ,
8295	0	a	but our manufacturing department is not so advanced in its techniques .
8296	0	a	They are actually very slow in its techniques .
8297	0	a	Okay ,
8298	0	a	so we have to deal with wh what is possible here .
8299	0	a	So So I am afraid it is not possible .
8300	0	a	Yeah .
8301	0	a	Okay .
8302	0	a	more f more more decisions we made .
8303	0	a	The scroll heel .
8304	0	a	A scroll wheel .
8305	0	a	Yes ,
8306	0	a	the voice recognition we already decided .
8307	0	a	Voice recognition , of course .
8308	0	a	Okay , so
8309	0	a	scroll wheel .
8310	0	a	But there will be some additional buttons , I guess .
8311	0	a	Yeah .
8312	1	a	And th the they should be spongy also ,
8313	0	a	because they are they are rubber too .
8314	0	a	I am going to leave that up to you two .
8315	0	a	What what did you say ?
8316	0	a	Yeah .
8317	0	a	Well
8318	0	a	you can use
8319	0	a	well ,
8320	1	a	when you use the buttons , they will they will be made of rubber too .
8321	0	a	So it has th the spongy feel also .
8322	0	a	Yeah .
8323	0	a	Yeah ,
8324	1	a	or you could use plastic buttons .
8325	1	a	In the rubber .
8326	0	a	I think rubber is nice .
8327	0	a	Because it
8328	0	a	i
8329	0	a	I mean what do you touch
8330	0	a	the button ,
8331	0	a	and what do they want
8332	0	a	spongy devices ,
8333	0	a	or or i .
8334	0	a	Yeah ,
8335	0	a	b
8336	0	a	But then you just have the the fact that the drawings on the buttons will disappear eventually .
8337	0	a	What I said in the in the first discussion , the digit six on the button , it will disappear when it is from rubber .
8338	0	a	is that
8339	0	a	does our our supplier say so ?
8340	0	a	Yeah .
8341	0	a	It is not something
8342	0	a	it is no information I read about it or so ,
8343	0	a	but it is just from
8344	0	a	No ,
8345	0	a	but but it
8346	0	a	Yeah , b yeah .
8347	0	a	did not did we inc include the digi digits or leave them to the speech recognition ?
8348	1	a	Cause things like volume could be placed next to the button .
8349	0	a	You could place a
8350	0	a	this this would be the button .
8351	0	a	There the icons .
8352	0	a	The scroll wheel , I mean .
8353	1	a	And you could place the indica th th the signals the
8354	0	a	No no , there is no painting ,
8355	0	a	only yellow or
8356	0	a	But it is into the rubber .
8357	0	a	Yes .
8358	0	a	That is okay .
8359	0	a	Yeah , that is possible ,
8360	0	a	but then you have still the images on the rubber of the case .
8361	0	a	So still then , if you feel li if you feel your remote control , you just rub on the cover , so you rub on the painting .
8362	0	a	Yeah .
8363	0	a	Yeah ,
8364	0	a	but but the the plus or the minus .
8365	0	a	Yes , the signs .
8366	0	a	You have to draw the
8367	0	a	Yeah ,
8368	0	a	it is on the cover .
8369	0	a	Yeah ,
8370	0	a	but this is on the pla
8371	0	a	yeah , I know .
8372	0	a	I think I know which you understand
8373	0	a	af
8374	0	a	I know what you mean .
8375	0	a	So if you
8376	0	a	You just move the problem .
8377	0	a	What about making this rubber and making this plastic ?
8378	0	a	Yeah .
8379	0	a	I see what you mean .
8380	0	a	Well ,
8381	0	a	maybe that is possible ,
8382	0	a	because our manufacturing division also offers plastic finishing .
8383	0	a	So maybe they can combine these two .
8384	0	a	Well actually ,
8385	0	a	we should have it the other way around , I guess .
8386	0	a	A plastic cover with rubber finishing .
8387	0	a	I mean , this is this is the finishing .
8388	0	a	This is what is on the edge .
8389	0	a	What you feel .
8390	0	a	Yeah .
8391	1	a	But the front , on which the the buttons are does not have to be rubber .
8392	0	a	I mean
8393	0	a	I know ,
8394	0	a	but do you touch this or do you touch this ?
8395	0	a	I mean , I I never touch between the buttons .
8396	0	a	Well ,
8397	0	a	I am I am not so sure ,
8398	0	a	I think it c should be
8399	0	a	Well ,
8400	0	a	I am not sure ,
8401	1	a	I have to ask with manufacturing ,
8402	0	a	but I am I am not sure that is what you want ,
8403	0	a	because our customers specifically ask for the spongy feel , and that is what you get with rubber .
8404	0	a	Y
8405	0	a	can you separate these these
8406	0	a	I do .
8407	0	a	So if you want the spongy feel , you need to make these buttons all all of rubber .
8408	0	a	I think both .
8409	0	a	I do .
8410	0	a	Or the s the sideways .
8411	0	a	I think
8412	0	a	Okay .
8413	0	a	Or the the back .
8414	0	a	Yeah , the side , exactly , the sideways .
8415	0	a	Or the back .
8416	0	a	The side ,
8417	0	a	but do you touch between the the these buttons ?
8418	0	a	Okay .
8419	0	a	I think
8420	0	a	Yes , especially when there are l a few buttons on it , you have a lot of space to touch .
8421	0	a	So you just have it in your hand completely or or i you play with it .
8422	0	a	Well ,
8423	0	a	we do not have very much time left .
8424	1	a	I guess you two have to figure that out .
8425	0	a	Yeah .
8426	1	a	I am going to leave the decision to you ,
8427	0	a	because you have to make its prototype ,
8428	0	a	and yeah
8429	0	a	y
8430	0	a	you have the most knowledge about the suppliers , the possibilities
8431	0	a	and
8432	1	a	so I am going to leave it the decision with you .
8433	0	a	Yeah .
8434	0	a	Sebastian , did you write enough decisions down ?
8435	0	a	Yeah .
8436	0	a	not quite .
8437	0	a	what about the chips ?
8438	0	a	We use the regular chip ?
8439	0	a	Okay .
8440	0	a	Regular .
8441	0	a	And
8442	0	a	Well
8443	0	a	no , I think that is about it .
8444	0	a	Use with .
8445	0	a	Yes .
8446	0	a	Okay .
8447	0	a	With those regular chips we can still control advanced functions .
8448	0	a	The chip is is not really
8449	0	a	Okay , well .
8450	0	a	The only difference between the advanced and the regular version is that the advanced version of the chip supports LCD .
8451	0	a	That is all .
8452	0	a	And we have decided not to use LCD .
8453	0	a	Yeah .
8454	0	a	So
8455	0	a	Okay .
8456	0	a	Okay .
8457	0	a	okay ,
8458	0	a	then I think we are quite finished .
8459	0	a	I will see you guys in thirty minutes
8460	0	a	and
8461	0	a	Yeah ?
8462	0	a	Yeah ,
8463	0	a	if you write wrote anything down ,
8464	0	a	could you put it on the shared folder ?
8465	0	a	Yeah .
8466	0	a	For the finishing touch .
8467	0	a	Okay .
8468	0	a	yeah .
8469	0	a	I know ,
8470	0	a	but
8471	0	a	well
8472	0	a	Great .
8473	0	a	 
8474	0	a	That is the same as on the top of it with the the round button .
8475	0	a	Like this one .
8476	0	a	But we do not we do not
8477	0	a	we do think it is well
8478	0	a	what if with ease of use , w which prefers the which the the customer of the user prefers .
8479	0	a	It is important .
8480	0	a	I think th this is device which which has a learning curve .
8481	0	a	novice users u use this device as normal users use a c a remote control .
8482	0	a	And after a while they start to develop some skills in the the voice recognition functions , and then they will not use this dial as often .
8483	0	a	But other users who are new to this device need something like that .
8484	0	a	Okay .
8485	0	a	They n they need to understand what how to change channels and change the volume , so it is easier for them
8486	0	a	Yeah , maybe so .
8487	0	a	Could could I see the scroll bar as as as a sort of shortcut ?
8488	0	a	A a and the voice recognition as well ,
8489	0	a	th maybe you could could
8490	0	a	Yeah .
8491	0	a	Yes ,
8492	0	a	it is
8493	0	a	Well ,
8494	0	a	it is it is it is another approach ,
8495	0	a	it is more that our .
8496	0	a	There are there are many ways of doing things on such a device .
8497	0	a	It is it is quite easy .
8498	0	a	Okay .
8499	0	a	Okay ,
8500	0	a	good .
8501	0	a	And and the case is is rubber ?
8502	0	a	And the buttons ?
8503	0	a	Okay ,
8504	0	a	and the colouring ?
8505	0	a	with with grey or black .
8506	0	a	Yes , rubber ?
8507	0	a	There are plastic or rubber .
8508	0	a	Plastic or rubber .
8509	0	a	Well ,
8510	0	a	yeah .
8511	0	a	yellow with
8512	0	a	grey or black or something like that .
8513	0	a	Whatever cost cost the least .
8514	0	a	Okay ,
8515	1	a	we will we will come to that later .
8516	0	a	okay .
8517	0	a	Anything else to add
8518	0	a	or
8519	0	a	Yeah .
8520	0	a	No .
8521	1	a	maybe we should think about these buttons .
8522	0	a	Well ,
8523	1	a	you could use two of them to programme the channels on the two channel button ,
8524	0	a	cause you have to assign two channel new channels .
8525	0	a	But
8526	0	a	Yes ,
8527	0	a	but it
8528	0	a	but these are tasks that are only executed once , I think .
8529	0	a	M
8530	0	a	yeah .
8531	0	a	Or not ?
8532	0	a	Well
8533	0	a	okay .
8534	1	a	M m
8535	1	a	but maybe you do want a programme button to for example activate the voice recognition , or train the voice voice recognition .
8536	0	a	You
8537	0	a	Yes .
8538	0	a	Okay ,
8539	0	a	yeah , that is right .
8540	0	a	Or something li like that .
8541	1	a	And a button for disabling the voice recognition .
8542	0	a	Yeah
8543	1	a	al although by pressing the button for I n do not know two , three seconds , you could also say it you would disable it with a little beep and and
8544	0	a	but o okay ,
8545	0	a	that that is not really really important .
8546	0	a	Yes .
8547	0	a	Yeah .
8548	0	a	That is the basic idea , yeah .
8549	0	a	The basic
8550	0	a	okay .
8551	0	a	Of our prototype .
8552	0	a	Okay .
8553	0	a	you thought of some evaluation crit criteria ?
8554	1	a	Okay .
8555	0	a	my name is not name
8556	0	a	but
8557	0	a	well ,
8558	0	a	I used the the documents .
8559	0	a	You are nameless .
8560	0	a	And these were the most important criteria .
8561	0	a	It should be .
8562	0	a	yeah ,
8563	0	a	that is how the fashion guys state it .
8564	0	a	Is it spongy ?
8565	0	a	I believe it is fancy too .
8566	0	a	Fancy look and feel .
8567	0	a	So
8568	0	a	well
8569	0	a	appar
8570	0	a	Yeah ,
8571	1	a	but apparently we should not evaluate yet .
8572	0	a	So
8573	0	a	just walk through it step by step .
8574	0	a	I mean , is it fancy ,
8575	0	a	everything I believe
8576	0	a	I believe it is fancy .
8577	0	a	No .
8578	0	a	Oh ,
8579	0	a	sorry .
8580	0	a	So
8581	0	a	Yeah , I think these are the most important criteria .
8582	0	a	Okay .
8583	0	a	Okay , so
8584	0	a	this
8585	0	a	these are the cr the criteria .
8586	0	a	Okay , well
8587	1	a	the then we will switch to my presentation .
8588	0	a	So
8589	0	a	that is about it .
8590	0	a	The production costs .
8591	0	a	The costs are not under Can I this is the
8592	0	a	Yeah ,
8593	0	a	it is it is w way above above the the the twelve Euro fifty .
8594	0	a	Twenty two .
8595	0	a	Yikes .
8596	0	a	And what makes it very expensive is for example the solar cell .
8597	0	a	Well
8598	0	a	it is very expensive .
8599	1	a	So I guess we should skip that ,
8600	0	a	because it is not that important .
8601	0	a	Okay .
8602	0	a	Why does the price and and the s
8603	0	a	oh ,
8604	0	a	one exa
8605	0	a	yeah .
8606	0	a	Yeah ,
8607	0	a	the the price , the the number of items and the the sum .
8608	0	a	The number of
8609	0	a	yeah .
8610	0	a	Okay .
8611	0	a	well ,
8612	0	a	this is what I would call our luxury model .
8613	0	a	if you would
8614	0	a	if you look at the w w w what we could do to make it more to make it just between the twelve Euro fifty , then I did the following changes .
8615	0	a	And and does it
8616	0	a	But that is that is only for the buttons .
8617	1	a	Twelve Euro forty cents I came up with by leaving out the solar cells , by not using the voice recognition feature ,
8618	0	a	because it is it is a four Euro addition to the price .
8619	0	a	Yeah ,
8620	0	a	I believe , push button ,
8621	0	a	well
8622	0	a	It makes it the thirteen
8623	0	a	yeah .
8624	0	a	Push buttons are buttons are are not the most expensive , but do add extra cost .
8625	0	a	So yeah ,
8626	0	a	th this design is not within our price model .
8627	0	a	Okay .
8628	0	a	Yeah .
8629	0	a	But I am afraid it is not complete .
8630	0	a	Because we use spec specic special materials , the last item .
8631	0	a	And you have not added one item there .
8632	0	a	So it is c way too expensive .
8633	0	a	It is still too expensive , yeah .
8634	1	a	I I guess if we leave the if we leave this one out ,
8635	0	a	oh .
8636	1	a	So the button we can use plastic .
8637	1	a	And maybe not use the special form .
8638	0	a	And the pla
8639	0	a	And a plastic b just plastic buttons , a plas instead of rubber .
8640	0	a	But it
8641	0	a	Yes .
8642	0	a	It becomes a very dull remote control , I know .
8643	0	a	But it is the board decision .
8644	0	a	And
8645	0	a	yeah .
8646	0	a	Well , b basically
8647	0	a	it
8648	1	a	when when this is our only option , we should even consider changing the casing ,
8649	0	a	because I think there is very little added value in an enhanced case with these dull functions .
8650	0	a	Yeah .
8651	0	a	Yeah , I know .
8652	0	a	So
8653	1	a	Type of m maybe another market segment .
8654	1	a	Maybe we should look at an focus on another
8655	0	a	Yeah ,
8656	0	a	m
8657	1	a	maybe not not all that fancy , but just way way more easy basic and m maximise the profits
8658	0	a	and
8659	0	a	Yeah .
8660	0	a	Yeah .
8661	0	a	Yes .
8662	0	a	That is maybe that is better .
8663	1	a	Maybe we could we should go for straight and simple ,
8664	0	a	but that is not what has been asked .
8665	0	a	Yeah .
8666	0	a	I know , I know .
8667	0	a	So
8668	0	a	we should kick the board is
8669	0	a	Well
8670	0	a	Yeah .
8671	0	a	Although I think we yeah , but we could still make a remote control that ap applies more to young people
8672	1	a	by giving it another colour already .
8673	0	a	so
8674	0	a	it is possible to make a device that attracts a little bit more to young people .
8675	0	a	Yes .
8676	0	a	but I agree it is it is not a fancy high tech device .
8677	0	a	Definitely not , no .
8678	0	a	It is not that innovative .
8679	0	a	Or however you s pronounce that .
8680	0	a	so , okay .
8681	0	a	Yeah , too bad .
8682	0	a	Oh ,
8683	0	a	this is the wrong one .
8684	0	a	So
8685	0	a	that means redesign .
8686	0	a	We do not have the time o now to to redesign the product .
8687	1	a	but we can evaluate the process and the satisfaction on how things went .
8688	0	a	I am not sure if we need to evaluate the device first .
8689	0	a	I guess
8690	0	a	Yeah .
8691	0	a	well ,
8692	0	a	since we are not going to manufacture it anyway
8693	0	a	Yay .
8694	0	a	Yeah , that is true .
8695	0	a	Well ,
8696	0	a	maybe it is good to do it anyway ,
8697	0	a	because if we evaluate it , we we can also determine if our objectives are good .
8698	0	a	We l we can learn .
8699	0	a	Yeah .
8700	0	a	Yeah .
8701	0	a	So
8702	0	a	Is it fancy ?
8703	0	a	I think so .
8704	0	a	I agree .
8705	0	a	Well
8706	0	a	I d
8707	0	a	it is it is
8708	0	a	Yeah , I think so .
8709	0	a	Is it ?
8710	0	a	Is it fancy ?
8711	0	a	So
8712	0	a	one ?
8713	0	a	Is it And w
8714	0	a	yeah ,
8715	0	a	w what they want wanted was colours and soft materials .
8716	0	a	the yellow rubber , I think so .
8717	0	a	You like the rubber , Roo .
8718	0	a	I am into it .
8719	0	a	But it is not that fancy .
8720	0	a	Yeah .
8721	0	a	No , I will I will I will give it a two .
8722	0	a	I mean
8723	0	a	I think I think it would have been more fancy if we used the titanium housing the casing .
8724	0	a	It would be even more
8725	0	a	oh , you really like titanium .
8726	0	a	You like tita
8727	0	a	That is a flavour as well .
8728	0	a	I am I am into it .
8729	0	a	It has flavour .
8730	0	a	Yes , that is right .
8731	0	a	You should taste it .
8732	0	a	Right .
8733	0	a	Yeah , I know ,
8734	0	a	but but it but that is fancy in the way
8735	0	a	I mean fancy has has a lot of
8736	0	a	Yeah .
8737	0	a	It has to do with fashion , I guess .
8738	0	a	So
8739	0	a	do
8740	0	a	Okay .
8741	0	a	It is trendy trendy , fun
8742	0	a	yeah .
8743	0	a	So in that way It it is fancy .
8744	0	a	Yeah .
8745	0	a	It applies .
8746	0	a	It
8747	0	a	yeah .
8748	0	a	Well ,
8749	0	a	just give it a two .
8750	0	a	Yeah .
8751	0	a	Yes .
8752	0	a	I think I th
8753	0	a	I think it would have been
8754	0	a	I would have think
8755	0	a	it could have been more fancy by using the double curved case .
8756	0	a	It is not the ultimate fancy two , but
8757	0	a	Yeah ,
8758	0	a	but that is sti that is
8759	0	a	Looking at the user needs , we only do not we do not have the double curved case .
8760	0	a	It would have been even more fancy ,
8761	0	a	but we decided not to , because if we use a double curved case , we could not use solar .
8762	0	a	So
8763	0	a	Yes .
8764	0	a	We w we do have the rubber , we do have the colours .
8765	0	a	That is two out of three .
8766	0	a	So I believe we are close to two .
8767	0	a	Yeah , I I agree .
8768	0	a	Yes , I agree too .
8769	0	a	It is okay .
8770	0	a	We did
8771	0	a	yes ,
8772	0	a	we did good .
8773	0	a	Okay , and
8774	0	a	was it innovative ?
8775	0	a	Yep .
8776	0	a	Well ,
8777	0	a	with the voice recognition feature
8778	0	a	and
8779	0	a	No ,
8780	0	a	we are evaluating this this design now .
8781	0	a	But that is not in it .
8782	0	a	Ov or can we
8783	0	a	Okay .
8784	0	a	Well ,
8785	0	a	let is let is this product .
8786	0	a	So I I
8787	0	a	I think it is .
8788	0	a	This prototype .
8789	0	a	I think it is innovative .
8790	0	a	Yeah .
8791	0	a	And the scroll wheel .
8792	0	a	The solar not many remotes have the solar , I think .
8793	0	a	No .
8794	0	a	It could have been a little bit more innovative u by using the kinetic energy source ,
8795	0	a	but it is it is way too
8796	0	a	yes ,
8797	0	a	but
8798	0	a	I think it is a two .
8799	0	a	Yeah , and So
8800	0	a	also a two ?
8801	0	a	Is it easy to use ?
8802	0	a	Well
8803	0	a	the p
8804	0	a	the most important function is easy to use .
8805	0	a	That would have been a thrill .
8806	0	a	Yep .
8807	0	a	I am not sure .
8808	0	a	Yeah .
8809	0	a	I am not sure .
8810	0	a	Well yeah ,
8811	0	a	the voice recognition of course is hard to learn , I think .
8812	0	a	Well ,
8813	0	a	hard
8814	0	a	it is not for the for the e for the elderly .
8815	0	a	Well ,
8816	0	a	but there are two parts in this remote control .
8817	0	a	They wo not use it .
8818	0	a	What you see here is is the basic part .
8819	0	a	Everybody can use it ,
8820	0	a	so that is easy to use .
8821	0	a	Yeah .
8822	0	a	That is for a novice user .
8823	0	a	When you have a more advanced , elaborate user , well , such a user really would like to explore all these additional functions .
8824	0	a	So in that in that way it is advanced ,
8825	0	a	and I think it is easy to use for for both types of users .
8826	0	a	Yeah .
8827	0	a	So
8828	0	a	It is maybe it is not very easy for
8829	0	a	Okay .
8830	0	a	I think I think a three .
8831	1	a	Would not give it more .
8832	0	a	I am doubting doubting as well .
8833	0	a	The the zapping , channel switching , volume .
8834	0	a	But the more advanced functions are probably a bit harder .
8835	0	a	Okay .
8836	0	a	two or three ?
8837	0	a	Three ?
8838	0	a	Wha wh what would be your guess ?
8839	0	a	I mean ease of use does not only apply to the most basic functions .
8840	0	a	It is the it is it is overall .
8841	0	a	Is the device easy to use ?
8842	0	a	Yeah .
8843	0	a	Yeah , that is right .
8844	0	a	You are right in that ,
8845	0	a	but I I guess an advanced user will will find the voice recognition function easy to use , because he is already he or she is already an advanced user .
8846	0	a	Yeah .
8847	0	a	So
8848	0	a	After all , I think personally I would give a two .
8849	0	a	Okay .
8850	0	a	But
8851	0	a	So , it is two , two and three .
8852	0	a	Roo , a three ?
8853	0	a	Ruud ?
8854	0	a	Okay .
8855	0	a	Yep .
8856	0	a	Good question .
8857	0	a	I will go for the two .
8858	0	a	Two threes .
8859	0	a	So that is ten .
8860	0	a	So
8861	0	a	I could make it e easy ?
8862	0	a	Roo .
8863	0	a	If you make it a four it will be three in general .
8864	0	a	So that is w
8865	0	a	No ,
8866	0	a	two and a half .
8867	0	a	If he makes it a four .
8868	0	a	Six and four .
8869	0	a	Not a three .
8870	0	a	Six and four is ten .
8871	0	a	Divided by four is two and a half .
8872	0	a	So
8873	0	a	Yes .
8874	0	a	Darn .
8875	0	a	Nee .
8876	0	a	Huh ?
8877	0	a	Yeah .
8878	0	a	A seven , a three
8879	0	a	No .
8880	0	a	A four and a three together .
8881	0	a	I yeah .
8882	0	a	Four ?
8883	0	a	Two ?
8884	0	a	Divided by four .
8885	0	a	Yeah , you have a two , he has a two .
8886	0	a	Yeah , two , two , three
8887	0	a	No .
8888	0	a	Three ?
8889	0	a	And a three ?
8890	0	a	Nee .
8891	0	a	No ,
8892	0	a	I have not said anything yet .
8893	0	a	I know .
8894	0	a	Okay ,
8895	0	a	but if I would say a three , then it is six , and four is ten .
8896	0	a	Divided by four is two point five .
8897	0	a	Yes .
8898	0	a	So if you want to have the conclusion as a three three .
8899	0	a	Then you would make a four .
8900	0	a	If you fill out a four
8901	0	a	Yeah ,
8902	0	a	we have not re re really worked it out ,
8903	1	a	but you c you can you can just say find and he repeats find .
8904	0	a	That is not even
8905	0	a	But that is not possible to fill in ,
8906	1	a	so we have to round it .
8907	0	a	But I am filling in a three .
8908	0	a	Does it will
8909	0	a	so it will be a two point five .
8910	0	a	Yes , it is .
8911	0	a	I have a veto .
8912	0	a	Exactly .
8913	0	a	It is not about the content ,
8914	0	a	it is about
8915	0	a	okay ,
8916	0	a	is it easy to f
8917	0	a	Yeah , definitely .
8918	0	a	Is it easy to find ?
8919	0	a	Yeah , I agree .
8920	0	a	Yes .
8921	0	a	It it most definitely is it is very easy .
8922	0	a	Yeah ,
8923	1	a	or beeps
8924	0	a	or
8925	0	a	yeah .
8926	0	a	Yeah ,
8927	0	a	but that is the that is the the basic idea of the the speaker
8928	0	a	But even without it
8929	0	a	Yeah .
8930	0	a	Yes .
8931	0	a	Maybe I
8932	0	a	I think I think
8933	0	a	something like that .
8934	1	a	I am here , I am here .
8935	1	a	Maybe you have to programme it once , so to that l respond to a certain word or a certain sentence , something like where are you ,
8936	1	a	and then it will sing I am here .
8937	0	a	Yeah .
8938	0	a	Yeah .
8939	0	a	Yeah .
8940	1	a	So something like that .
8941	0	a	So ,
8942	0	a	I th
8943	0	a	Yeah , me too .
8944	0	a	Well , I
8945	1	a	we should not stay too long on this subject because of the time ,
8946	0	a	but I personally give it a one .
8947	0	a	Sebastian ?
8948	0	a	Right , well .
8949	0	a	Me too .
8950	0	a	The feel of the remote control is spongy .
8951	0	a	Well ,
8952	0	a	it ca not be more spongy .
8953	0	a	So
8954	0	a	No okay ,
8955	0	a	but but
8956	0	a	for the options given , it is the most spongy one .
8957	0	a	Well ,
8958	0	a	it can be .
8959	0	a	There are cases in which the outside casing is can be how d how do you prono is is moldable .
8960	0	a	Was it one of our options ?
8961	0	a	So , in the in
8962	0	a	Yeah .
8963	0	a	No , it is not one of our option ,
8964	0	a	but when you look in the market , when you look
8965	0	a	yes ,
8966	0	a	but that is not that is not what they are talking about , I think .
8967	0	a	No .
8968	0	a	this this was a most spongy option .
8969	0	a	Because we compare all these characteristics characteristics with market with with the real market .
8970	0	a	Yeah .
8971	0	a	So
8972	0	a	there are remote controls out there which are a lot more spongy .
8973	0	a	Yeah .
8974	0	a	They are out there .
8975	0	a	They are out there .
8976	0	a	But I think in this case in this case we have done the best we could .
8977	0	a	Yes , but it is not good enough , so it is a two .
8978	0	a	Yeah .
8979	0	a	I will give it a one .
8980	0	a	I wan
8981	0	a	I will take one .
8982	0	a	You take one ?
8983	0	a	What do you give it ?
8984	0	a	No no no .
8985	0	a	Well yeah ,
8986	0	a	it depends ,
8987	0	a	cause it is the most spongy we could
8988	0	a	but
8989	0	a	yeah .
8990	0	a	Yeah , I know ,
8991	1	a	but you have to name a fig a number .
8992	0	a	Because we need to go on in for the time .
8993	0	a	Well ,
8994	0	a	if I give it a one there will be one hell of a calculation .
8995	0	a	It will be a one .
8996	0	a	So I will just give it a two
8997	0	a	and make this a one point five .
8998	1	a	I will I will change it ,
8999	0	a	I will make it m
9000	0	a	my my mark will be a four .
9001	0	a	You are
9002	0	a	okay .
9003	0	a	The remote control offers enough features .
9004	0	a	Well ,
9005	0	a	Ruud , what what do you think about it ?
9006	0	a	Yeah .
9007	0	a	Well ,
9008	0	a	the basic layout does not offem offer much , but the voice recognition could add a lot .
9009	0	a	So
9010	0	a	Yeah ,
9011	0	a	depends .
9012	0	a	Basically it is it is completely programmable .
9013	0	a	You can add very m much functionality by using the voice recognition mode .
9014	0	a	Yeah , I know .
9015	0	a	So it is quite advanced .
9016	0	a	What what we did not talk about is
9017	0	a	I think it has .
9018	0	a	Yeah ,
9019	0	a	but it ha does not has the digits .
9020	0	a	I believe it is
9021	0	a	If you ask yourself it offers enough features , I do not I do not think it is it has all the features a normal remote has .
9022	0	a	depends on what you implement in the speech feat
9023	0	a	Signal .
9024	0	a	Yeah .
9025	0	a	Bec because you can
9026	0	a	we did not talk about it , but you do have remote controls that are able to adapt another signal .
9027	0	a	Yes .
9028	0	a	So ,
9029	0	a	you place a a regular remote control in front of the other one , hit the one or the two or the three , whatever , and it r records the the the the signals .
9030	0	a	Has the signals sent to it .
9031	0	a	Yeah .
9032	0	a	So you could enter any comment you like , as long it is able to as long as our device is able to reproduce the infrared signal .
9033	0	a	So I think th this this is a a remote control with a very high level of features .
9034	0	a	Absolutely .
9035	0	a	Although there are i a few buttons , but the inside is is quite advanced .
9036	0	a	Yes .
9037	0	a	But that that is its power , I guess , because a regular programmable remote control contains , well , really a lot of buttons .
9038	0	a	Yeah .
9039	0	a	At at least forty buttons .
9040	0	a	Yeah .
9041	0	a	So it is it is quite s complicated to get to get used to .
9042	0	a	And this is quite s simple .
9043	0	a	You can use your voice to to programme it .
9044	0	a	Yep .
9045	0	a	It is
9046	0	a	Yeah , I will give it a one .
9047	0	a	Yeah .
9048	0	a	Okay ,
9049	0	a	let is give it a number .
9050	0	a	I will give it a one .
9051	0	a	For for the for this t type of market , I think it is a one .
9052	0	a	I will give a two .
9053	0	a	I think think a one ,
9054	0	a	cause v with a voice recognition you could add anything you want ,
9055	0	a	so that is like
9056	0	a	Maybe even because it does not look advanced .
9057	0	a	Yes .
9058	0	a	I I have I think we have succe succeed in in developing a product that is actually quite good , but not for this kind of market , and not for this kind of price .
9059	0	a	So
9060	0	a	Yeah .
9061	0	a	So high quality , low acceptance .
9062	0	a	The product is is is b high qua has a high quality and and is advanced .
9063	0	a	Yes .
9064	0	a	But whether or not our clients are are willing to pay twenty five Euros for this kind of device is doub is well , is not sure .
9065	0	a	D do you agree ?
9066	0	a	Yeah .
9067	0	a	Yes , I agree .
9068	0	a	I
9069	0	a	Yeah , okay .
9070	0	a	Maybe we should have a radar function .
9071	0	a	But
9072	0	a	Yes .
9073	0	a	But we could could not what
9074	0	a	what is the selling price ?
9075	0	a	Fifty ?
9076	0	a	twenty five .
9077	0	a	Twenty five Euros .
9078	0	a	And costs were twelve fifty .
9079	0	a	Yeah .
9080	0	a	But even now , if only our production costs w were exceeded the double ,
9081	0	a	Think .
9082	0	a	Production cost was were t was twenty two ?
9083	0	a	So
9084	0	a	selling price would be
9085	0	a	yeah .
9086	0	a	M about fifty Euros .
9087	0	a	That is quite ex
9088	0	a	well ,
9089	0	a	it is not it is not very expensive for a remote control that that has this functionality .
9090	0	a	That is price , but w w
9091	0	a	No .
9092	0	a	An original remote control of any TV kind , a Phillips remote control , y you pay
9093	0	a	Yeah ,
9094	0	a	I kn I know from a few years ago , it it it costed hundred Gilders .
9095	0	a	Yes ,
9096	0	a	it is more than fifty Euros .
9097	0	a	It is quite expensive , yes .
9098	0	a	Bu but well
9099	0	a	yeah , I know ,
9100	0	a	but you are paying for th for the brand , because there are remote controls which control your stereo , television , DVD , CD player , for under twenty five Euros .
9101	0	a	Yes .
9102	0	a	Yes ,
9103	0	a	but you can you c
9104	0	a	Yes ,
9105	0	a	but you can learn this thing , all these functions .
9106	0	a	And it is easier to use because those remote controls do not offer voice recognition and this one does .
9107	0	a	Yeah .
9108	0	a	Yeah .
9109	0	a	So I think it is worth its price .
9110	0	a	Okay .
9111	0	a	you had an overall rating .
9112	0	a	That is counting .
9113	0	a	Yeah ,
9114	0	a	but with these ratings
9115	0	a	should be about one point s seven ,
9116	0	a	yeah .
9117	0	a	Well ,
9118	0	a	it is it is about one point five .
9119	0	a	Four six seven eight .
9120	0	a	Something like that .
9121	0	a	Okay .
9122	0	a	Nine divided by six .
9123	0	a	Okay .
9124	1	a	we will go further on with the the rest of the evaluation .
9125	1	a	About the project itself , not about the product .
9126	0	a	What did you think about the process , the project process ?
9127	0	a	Ruud ?
9128	1	a	Try to translate that .
9129	0	a	Well Well ,
9130	0	a	I think
9131	0	a	Any any other
9132	0	a	, Roo ?
9133	1	a	Roo .
9134	0	a	Yeah ,
9135	0	a	I think
9136	0	a	The process was good .
9137	0	a	The prices .
9138	0	a	But w we were not aware of the prices of the costs .
9139	0	a	Yeah .
9140	0	a	And and that was the the big deal .
9141	0	a	I if we knew that before , we c we could have made
9142	0	a	the the choice between what
9143	0	a	yeah .
9144	0	a	Actually ,
9145	0	a	we had
9146	0	a	Yes .
9147	0	a	Better decision .
9148	0	a	We had we had too little information actually .
9149	0	a	Yeah .
9150	0	a	So And
9151	0	a	the the the
9152	0	a	well ,
9153	0	a	looking at room for creativity , there was w way too the the choice of components was way too narrow .
9154	0	a	Less .
9155	0	a	So there was not really a process of
9156	0	a	Well
9157	0	a	Yes .
9158	0	a	Yeah .
9159	0	a	So we could we we could be we could have been creative .
9160	0	a	But it was tempered by the choice of components and the the price .
9161	0	a	Well ,
9162	0	a	in the first meeting we we already were very creative .
9163	0	a	We we thought of possibilities who are not possible with the the current offer of manufacturing components .
9164	0	a	Yeah .
9165	0	a	So
9166	0	a	We are tempered by that , yes .
9167	0	a	Yeah .
9168	0	a	Okay ,
9169	0	a	Roo ?
9170	0	a	Any other thoughts on that ?
9171	0	a	Ruud ?
9172	0	a	You agree , okay .
9173	0	a	No , no .
9174	0	a	I agree .
9175	0	a	leadership .
9176	0	a	Fantastic .
9177	0	a	Okay , Roo is on for his promotion .
9178	0	a	Yeah , okay .
9179	0	a	Okay .
9180	0	a	I think we are a good team .
9181	0	a	I think so too ,
9182	0	a	it is it is it is of course a laboratory environment .
9183	0	a	I missed it to be able to contact you in between and say , hey Roo .
9184	0	a	Yes .
9185	0	a	Yeah .
9186	0	a	Yeah .
9187	0	a	Well ,
9188	0	a	I tried once , but that was not allowed .
9189	0	a	So Yeah ,
9190	0	a	but but si w w w
9191	0	a	when taken in account the the situation , I think we performed pretty well .
9192	0	a	I think so too .
9193	0	a	Yeah .
9194	0	a	Yeah .
9195	0	a	the means , the SMARTboard , the digital pen .
9196	0	a	Did you like them ?
9197	0	a	Because of the response
9198	0	a	or
9199	0	a	Okay .
9200	0	a	The digital pen was okay , but SMARTboard was really bad .
9201	0	a	Yeah .
9202	0	a	It it is
9203	0	a	The response is very slow and the possibilities are very limited .
9204	0	a	Response
9205	0	a	and it it has
9206	0	a	yeah .
9207	0	a	It is not accurate .
9208	0	a	Okay , so
9209	1	a	it it had to be better aligned , or what is the word ?
9210	0	a	yeah .
9211	0	a	Yeah , it is not accurate .
9212	0	a	The p the pointing of the pen is not the place where it it writes
9213	0	a	its where it
9214	0	a	Yeah , where it draws .
9215	0	a	Draws .
9216	0	a	It is
9217	0	a	the drawing on on the b on the board is r right from the pen .
9218	0	a	So
9219	0	a	You to take in account that your you m
9220	0	a	yeah
9221	0	a	It is too slow
9222	0	a	Maybe it is it needs to be calibrateds .
9223	0	a	It it was calibrated just before this meeting .
9224	0	a	the one before , the third meeting .
9225	0	a	It is ?
9226	0	a	Okay .
9227	0	a	So it is not the calibration , it is the thing itself , I think .
9228	0	a	Okay .
9229	0	a	Ruud , w did you use the pen a lot ?
9230	0	a	Or not at all ?
9231	0	a	Not at all .
9232	0	a	No .
9233	0	a	Not really .
9234	0	a	Okay .
9235	0	a	I thought it was quite a handy thing ,
9236	1	a	although I would like to see OCR .
9237	0	a	I I think so too .
9238	0	a	Yes .
9239	0	a	Yep .
9240	0	a	Yes .
9241	0	a	If it has OCR , I think I would use , but I I just took notes for myself and
9242	0	a	and and that is it .
9243	0	a	Yeah .
9244	0	a	It w it w
9245	0	a	yeah .
9246	0	a	It was necessary for me to
9247	0	a	Yeah ,
9248	0	a	because if I want something on the computer , I just type it .
9249	0	a	To digitise them .
9250	0	a	Yeah .
9251	0	a	I type faster than I write .
9252	0	a	So
9253	0	a	Economic .
9254	0	a	Yeah .
9255	0	a	But I think it is a great solution for for a known problem , writing down some notes , some some inf information , and then forgetting your notebook somewhere and losing all that information .
9256	0	a	Yeah .
9257	0	a	Because you have everything in one place
9258	0	a	and it is quite easy quite easy
9259	0	a	it is it is possible to make this information digital and share it with others in a quite easy way .
9260	0	a	Yeah .
9261	0	a	I think it is a good product .
9262	0	a	I only think it is th the the shape of the pen is too big .
9263	0	a	Yeah .
9264	0	a	It is not quite ergonomic .
9265	0	a	Eco ergonomic .
9266	0	a	I know .
9267	0	a	Yeah .
9268	0	a	Okay .
9269	0	a	What w
9270	0	a	Ruud , what did you think about the SMARTboards ?
9271	0	a	Yeah .
9272	0	a	Oh ,
9273	0	a	I only use it to draw a rabbit ,
9274	0	a	so ca not say much about it .
9275	0	a	Okay , you ca not really decide .
9276	0	a	No .
9277	0	a	I missed a feature to easily select a slide and distribute it to the laptops .
9278	1	a	I think that would be very easy if you could say okay
9279	1	a	, I want to use this for my own work or my own presentation further on
9280	0	a	or
9281	0	a	Or the other way around ,
9282	0	a	that you could show but m
9283	0	a	I know .
9284	0	a	Yes .
9285	0	a	No ,
9286	1	a	or the other way around .
9287	0	a	Yeah .
9288	0	a	Yes , yes .
9289	0	a	That is quite what PowerPoint does .
9290	0	a	But y you can
9291	0	a	if you save this image , you can open it in your shared work folder .
9292	0	a	Yeah .
9293	0	a	I know ,
9294	0	a	but
9295	0	a	I know ,
9296	0	a	but we could not use that feature , so I missed it .
9297	0	a	So it is almost
9298	0	a	yeah .
9299	0	a	Yep .
9300	0	a	We were not able to do that .
9301	0	a	At least the I was not explained how to do such a th
9302	0	a	Okay .
9303	0	a	A and the function of of filling an an an oval or an an object .
9304	0	a	An object , yes .
9305	0	a	Yes .
9306	0	a	The drawing cap capabilities are very limited .
9307	0	a	I it is not possible
9308	0	a	yeah .
9309	0	a	And and w you were when you are using Windows , you are used to a certain interface and certain buttons , which you can use for drawing .
9310	0	a	Yeah .
9311	0	a	And a lot of these buttons do not appear here .
9312	0	a	So it is
9313	0	a	Not not n not way .
9314	0	a	Oh it looks like paint actually .
9315	0	a	Okay , so
9316	0	a	y it
9317	0	a	it is not even as advanced as paint .
9318	0	a	Yeah .
9319	0	a	It is quite limited .
9320	0	a	Okay .
9321	0	a	no .
9322	0	a	Yeah , the project is evaluated .
9323	0	a	but , well ,
9324	0	a	we need to redesign the product .
9325	0	a	Okay .
9326	0	a	Oh ,
9327	0	a	very good ,
9328	1	a	celebration .
9329	0	a	Celebrate
9330	1	a	Pop pop up the champagne .
9331	0	a	Great .
9332	0	a	It was a privilege working with you .
9333	0	a	Okay .
9334	1	a	you are dismissed .
9335	0	a	No , I think we are ready .
9336	0	a	Okay .
9337	0	a	To private rooms ?
9338	0	a	But you see the problem ,
9339	0	a	y you ca not continue your your line .
9340	0	a	I see some action over there .
9341	0	a	Private room , Roo .
9342	0	a	That sounds quite scary .
9343	0	a	Okay .
9344	0	a	No , let is find the way to .
9345	0	a	we are done , we are finished , I believe .
9346	0	a	So ,
9347	0	a	are there any more cycles in this process ?
9348	0	a	I think not .
9349	0	a	I do not believe so .
9350	0	a	Well ,
9351	0	a	maybe we would get an email .
9352	0	a	Thank you for your Forty minutes .
9353	0	a	But how much time did we get for this meeting ?
9354	0	a	And how much time is left ?
9355	0	a	Ten minutes .
9356	0	a	A minute or or ten maybe .
9357	0	a	M
9358	0	a	Yeah , ten or five .
9359	0	a	Okay .
9360	0	a	Okay .
9361	0	a	So ,
9362	0	a	we can redesign our I would like to
9363	0	a	Oh .
9364	0	a	Well ,
9365	0	a	I think we we we all know what the redesign should be .
9366	0	a	A simple , dull , one coloured box .
9367	0	a	And no added value .
9368	0	a	No ,
9369	0	a	it is it is just the same product that is already on the market .
9370	0	a	At all .
9371	0	a	So
9372	0	a	In interesting design .
9373	0	a	Yeah .
9374	0	a	Well ,
9375	0	a	it is fluffy alright .
9376	0	a	Spongy .
9377	0	a	What is that ?
9378	0	a	It is a giraffe eating a eating leaves from a tree .
9379	0	a	A giraffe ?
9380	0	a	Right .
9381	0	a	Yeah .
9382	0	a	It is blue tongue .
9383	0	a	Yeah .

9389	0	a	Oh it it does have a natural feeling .
9390	0	a	So

9393	0	a	That is it is a new feature next to Bluetooth to disable all Bluetooth devices .

9414	0	a	Well ,
9415	0	a	of course we are new to each other ,
9416	1	a	so I would like to get acquainted first .
9417	1	a	So let is do that first ,
9418	0	a	I mean
9419	1	a	Let is start with you ,
9420	0	a	can you introduce yourself ?
9421	0	a	You are our Marketing Expert .

9428	0	a	Yeah .
9429	0	a	Nick Broer , User Interface Designer .
9430	0	a	I am going to look at the technical design from the user point of view .
9431	0	a	Excellent .
9432	0	a	Okay .
9433	0	a	My name is Xavier Juergens , I am the Industrial Designer , and there are three main questions that I have to find an answer to today .
9434	0	a	First one is what happens inside the apparatus , second is what is the apparatus made of , and the third is what should it look like .
9435	0	a	What should it look like ?
9436	0	a	Okay .
9437	0	a	Oh ,
9438	1	a	let is kick it off .
9439	0	a	Oh , there we go .
9440	0	a	So ,
9441	0	a	our new project is about
9442	0	a	we need design a remote control for television set ,
9443	0	a	so ,
9444	0	a	which has to be original , trendy and user friendly .
9445	0	a	I took this off our corporate website .
9446	0	a	It is
9447	0	a	I think well it sums up what we need to do .
9448	0	a	We are inspired by latest fashion , not only electronics , but also the latest trends in clothes and interior design .
9449	0	a	That is why our product will always fit in your home .
9450	1	a	So apparently we need to be very at very open to what is currently hot in the market .
9451	1	a	So that is what you need to do to bring us the latest info and what people want .
9452	0	a	Yeah .
9453	0	a	Yeah .
9454	0	a	So So
9455	0	a	we put the fashion in electronics .
9456	1	a	So that is what we need to go for .
9457	0	a	Anyway , we will take this project in three steps , three pha three phase of design .
9458	0	a	First step will be the functional design .
9459	0	a	Yeah .
9460	0	a	And that is basically what we are going to do .
9461	0	a	Everybody has a piece of individual work and a meeting afterwards , so we can share information
9462	0	a	about
9463	0	a	So
9464	1	a	I am going to keep this short ,
9465	0	a	since we had a technical problem .
9466	1	a	So skip through this .
9467	0	a	Okay .
9468	0	a	Every meeting we everybody can present their their views and everything , so to help with these , you have we have the SMARTboards here .
9469	0	a	We can use a regular PowerPoint presentation .
9470	1	a	I am supposed to give you an introduction on this doodling board ,
9471	0	a	so it is
9472	0	a	actually it is very easy .
9473	0	a	Like it says , very simple ,
9474	0	a	you just take out the pen .
9475	1	a	Like you see here , I will just take the take here .
9476	0	a	That is it , you just put it on the board .
9477	0	a	You see a pen here .
9478	0	a	You go here , just like using a pen .
9479	0	a	You can just draw whatever you want .
9480	0	a	It is like the eraser , can erase whatever you want .
9481	0	a	And so it will be easy just to illustrate your views , if you want to change the format , you just either take out jus just like the pen , and whatever you want , your current colour , your line width , just to make the line bigger .
9482	0	a	So it should be really easy .
9483	0	a	Okay .
9484	0	a	This is to take the
9485	0	a	just take a new slide and back again .
9486	0	a	We are just going to keep using this board all the time ,
9487	0	a	so I think it will be
9488	0	a	it is very clear for everyone , I suppose .
9489	0	a	So
9490	1	a	I will take this out .
9491	0	a	Okay .
9492	0	a	We will use that later .
9493	0	a	Anyway .
9494	0	a	Yeah , just just
9495	1	a	just stuff that you want to share , just put it in the in the project folder ,
9496	0	a	like I put my presentation now .
9497	1	a	I will put the the minutes of every meeting , I will put them there too ,
9498	0	a	so everybody can read up if they have to leave early or whatever .
9499	0	a	So
9500	0	a	next , been here .
9501	0	a	Well ,
9502	1	a	going to give the electronic white board a shot .
9503	0	a	So
9504	0	a	basic idea is we have a blank sheet .
9505	1	a	Just try whatever you want , and like it says , draw your favourite animal .
9506	1	a	I think the creative genius should go first .
9507	0	a	The creative genius ?
9508	0	a	Thank you very much .
9509	1	a	So , draw us your favourite animal .
9510	0	a	Well ,
9511	0	a	I am more into the technical aspects of drawing ,
9512	0	a	so I am not really good at drawing animals ,
9513	0	a	but the animal which I Oh .
9514	0	a	Draw us a technical animal .
9515	0	a	Yeah , it is still erasing .
9516	0	a	Pen .
9517	0	a	format .
9518	0	a	Else my animal will be like king size .
9519	0	a	I pretty much like a dolphin ,
9520	0	a	because of its its freedom basically .
9521	0	a	Let is see .
9522	0	a	A head .
9523	0	a	actually worked with this .
9524	0	a	It is like it is a very high tech .
9525	0	a	Bit low responsive though .
9526	0	a	Prefer pen and paper .
9527	1	a	So that is what we do not want .
9528	1	a	We want a high responsive product .
9529	1	a	So
9530	0	a	It looks more like nuclear bomb .
9531	0	a	Very nice dolphin .
9532	0	a	It does not look like a nuclear bomb .
9533	0	a	This thing is not doing what I am What I want .
9534	0	a	So
9535	0	a	Yeah , well it does look like a nuclear bomb .
9536	0	a	Let is go easy on it .
9537	1	a	I will just finish up real soon ,
9538	0	a	because I am
9539	0	a	So it does not really look like a dolphin , but then again , this is all new for me .
9540	0	a	Anyway , it should It
9541	0	a	It is supposed to be a dolphin , you like the freedom that it that it represents .
9542	0	a	Uh huh .
9543	0	a	Like the ocean , like swimming .
9544	0	a	Do that in my spare time ,
9545	0	a	so that is basically an
9546	0	a	Now we can forget this ever happened .
9547	0	a	What do you like ?
9548	0	a	Okay .
9549	0	a	Well ,

9604	0	a	Yeah .
9605	0	a	Press next .
9606	0	a	Yeah , it is up there .
9607	0	a	Okay .
9608	0	a	That is it .
9609	0	a	Okay , well
9610	1	a	the animal I would like to draw is a tiger .
9611	0	a	You picked a hard one , did not you ?
9612	0	a	Got it .
9613	0	a	Experience with the tiger .
9614	0	a	My drawing skills are really bad , so .
9615	0	a	What ?
9616	0	a	They are Okay uh huh .
9617	0	a	They are really bad , my drawing skills .
9618	0	a	Sure looks smooth .
9619	0	a	Oh .
9620	0	a	I am not sure how the legs should go ,
9621	0	a	but
9622	0	a	these are stripes .
9623	0	a	I have picked this animal because it is very fast .
9624	0	a	It is
9625	0	a	it knows exactly what it wants .
9626	0	a	it hardly ever wastes any resources .
9627	0	a	What does it want ?
9628	0	a	Okay .
9629	0	a	well , basically
9630	0	a	it hunts for prey , but it does it always in a very well thought way .
9631	0	a	it knows exactly what it wants .
9632	0	a	It never kills an animal just for the killing , so it is very efficient .
9633	0	a	And it tries to do everything as fast as possible .
9634	0	a	And it always goes for security , in seeking a hide spot and and doing everything , security , speed and efficiency is important .
9635	1	a	And I think those things we can use .
9636	0	a	I agree .
9637	0	a	Okay .
9638	0	a	Yay
9639	1	a	, I am supposed to draw the animal next .
9640	0	a	I introduce to the world the amazing ant .
9641	0	a	hard worker .
9642	0	a	Great team workers .
9643	0	a	Yeah .
9644	0	a	Yeah .
9645	0	a	Do everything to
9646	0	a	really small , but together they are really strong .
9647	1	a	So I am going to give it a smiley face .
9648	0	a	Yeah ,
9649	0	a	yeah .
9650	0	a	Oh .
9651	0	a	Not sure where the p .
9652	1	a	Just put them here .
9653	1	a	Whatever .
9654	1	a	Think it need shoes .
9655	1	a	So
9656	0	a	I am just too lazy to draw it all black , so
9657	0	a	That is the coolest ant ever .
9658	0	a	You have done this before , have not you ?
9659	0	a	Well ,
9660	1	a	I basically had a question .
9661	0	a	I love to draw ants .
9662	0	a	It is my hobby .
9663	0	a	Anyway Nah .
9664	0	a	Just
9665	0	a	I think it is very representative what we drew , I guess .
9666	1	a	Like you take just take your freedom and use a a trendy interface that you design for us .
9667	0	a	Yeah .
9668	0	a	Just Yeah .
9669	1	a	You are supposed to make i make it different from from what other people have , and just make it a little distinct .
9670	0	a	Anyway .
9671	0	a	another beep to stop the meeting .
9672	1	a	See .
9673	0	a	Warning .
9674	0	a	Finish meeting now .
9675	1	a	put this down .
9676	0	a	Examples .
9677	0	a	Well
9678	0	a	I guess we have a little little time extra ,
9679	0	a	but
9680	1	a	Just a little quick discussion to to open open our work .
9681	1	a	So what do you guys think about
9682	1	a	The first idea is just very short .
9683	1	a	I will start with you .
9684	1	a	What are y
9685	1	a	What are your first ideas for the new product ?
9686	0	a	What
9687	0	a	The project I got was just for a TV remote control .
9688	0	a	Do
9689	0	a	Are we going to introduce a multi remote control ?
9690	0	a	Is it just the TV
9691	0	a	or do we want to in
9692	0	a	Just for TV remote control .
9693	0	a	Yeah .
9694	0	a	Yeah , I guess so .
9695	0	a	Okay .
9696	0	a	Well ,
9697	1	a	I was thinking about design remote control , with our motto and all .
9698	0	a	But
9699	0	a	Yeah .
9700	1	a	thing to keep in mind is that we need to stick to what people are familiar with .
9701	1	a	No rational changes or whatever , cause it revolutionary changes ,
9702	0	a	yes .
9703	0	a	Okay ,
9704	0	a	so very intuitive design , I guess .
9705	1	a	we might have to consider other design aspects of our product .
9706	0	a	So that was something I wanted to add ,
9707	1	a	and perhaps some usability aspect .
9708	0	a	TV is becoming central in most homes .
9709	0	a	Do we want people who are disabled in any way to , yeah , to be able to use it as well ?
9710	0	a	Yeah .
9711	0	a	Yeah , we want
9712	0	a	I suppose we want almost everyone to be using it .
9713	0	a	So I think I mean , really disabled people , yeah , might be a problem ,
9714	1	a	but I think it is a little take it into consideration .
9715	0	a	yeah .
9716	0	a	I think we really need to cut the meeting short .
9717	0	a	You have anything you want to share quickly ?
9718	0	a	It should be light , okay .
9719	0	a	Only one thing that has to be added according to me
9720	1	a	is the the material it is made of , it should be something light .
9721	0	a	That is
9722	0	a	it speaks for itself ,
9723	0	a	but some
9724	0	a	Yeah .
9725	0	a	Yeah .
9726	0	a	, let is see ,
9727	0	a	where did I
9728	1	a	Let is skip that .
9729	0	a	Oh , this is it .
9730	0	a	Sorry ,
9731	0	a	I skipped this sheet .
9732	0	a	Selling price .
9733	0	a	What do we
9734	0	a	This Quick
9735	0	a	What we are going to
9736	0	a	Selling price , twenty five Euros .
9737	1	a	That is for you .
9738	0	a	The production price , twelve and a half Euros , approximately .
9739	0	a	Okay .
9740	1	a	Just go go for that .
9741	0	a	We will reach the reach that profit .
9742	0	a	Okay .
9743	0	a	Okay , well
9744	0	a	that is not that much to work with .
9745	0	a	international .
9746	0	a	No , it is not much to work on .
9747	0	a	I am sorry ,
9748	0	a	I skipped it .
9749	0	a	Anyways , that is
9750	0	a	Yeah ,
9751	0	a	this is it .
9752	1	a	Do you have anything you you came up with yet ?
9753	1	a	About marketing transfer , whatever ?
9754	0	a	Marketing
9755	1	a	I am not sure what you what you came up with yet .
9756	0	a	about what ?
9757	0	a	Marketing ?
9758	0	a	no , not really yet ,
9759	0	a	but I have some ideas

9761	0	a	Okay .
9762	1	a	You have anything to share ?

9795	1	a	so have a seat .
9796	0	a	Okay ,
9797	0	a	welcome again .
9798	0	a	Today , functional design phase .
9799	1	a	I will take you over the minutes of last last meeting .
9800	0	a	Okay ,
9801	0	a	that was just to get to know each other , have a little thoughts on what your vision is and on this project ,
9802	0	a	so
9803	0	a	I put the minutes on the I made on the on the p the the project share , so if you want to review them , they are there .
9804	1	a	I will do so after every meeting ,
9805	0	a	so if you have some information you want to take back you can find it there .
9806	0	a	Anyways ,
9807	0	a	today three presentations , from every one of you .
9808	0	a	after that I got some new project requirements from project board , so we are going to go af go after over this later .
9809	1	a	But I want to start with stuff you did first ,
9810	0	a	so we can see what everybody came up with .
9811	1	a	And after that we can have the new requirements and share some thoughts ,
9812	0	a	so .
9813	1	a	Who would like want to go first ?
9814	0	a	Take it .
9815	1	a	Yeah , sure , no problem .
9816	0	a	Go ahead .
9817	0	a	there was a little problem with my computer so not the whole presentation
9818	0	a	Yeah .
9819	0	a	Anyway ,
9820	1	a	let is see what you have .
9821	0	a	Okay ,
9822	0	a	I want to open the my s
9823	0	a	oh no .
9824	0	a	it is still a bit open .
9825	1	a	You should close it on your own notebook , I guess .
9826	0	a	Yeah .
9827	0	a	Oh no , that is okay .
9828	0	a	So there ?
9829	0	a	Okay .
9830	0	a	slide show .
9831	0	a	Yes .
9832	0	a	The functional requirements , it is very important for the user ,
9833	0	a	he he wants to
9834	0	a	yeah .
9835	0	a	The the method we used it it is not m not a slide , because it went wrong , but the method we use , we tested it w with a hundred men , and we asked them to w what the remote f feel like and what what is important .
9836	0	a	If I can cut in ,
9837	0	a	is it people or men ?
9838	0	a	Is it people , okay .
9839	0	a	People ,
9840	0	a	sorry .
9841	0	a	Both women and men ,
9842	0	a	yeah .
9843	0	a	Cause I thought it was only men ,
9844	0	a	so
9845	0	a	Kay .
9846	0	a	Okay .
9847	0	a	the findings seventy five percent of the users find most remote controls ugly .
9848	0	a	Yeah ,
9849	0	a	and
9850	0	a	yeah ,
9851	0	a	most th th
9852	0	a	they want to spend money for a better system , for better remote control ,
9853	1	a	so we can do a l a little nice things with it ,
9854	0	a	and they use
9855	0	a	yeah ,
9856	0	a	they use zap a lot ,
9857	0	a	fifty percent say they only
9858	0	a	So
9859	0	a	that is the most important things .
9860	0	a	That is pretty shocking .
9861	1	a	So we have to s we have to do something about that .
9862	0	a	Okay .
9863	0	a	oh yeah ,
9864	0	a	not all of it is it on mine on my PowerPoint presentation , but the relevant buttons are the power , the channel selection and the volume selection .
9865	0	a	Okay ,
9866	1	a	just talk ahead .
9867	0	a	It is the most basic buttons that a user wants to use .
9868	0	a	less important is tel teletext , they use it , but it is not very important on the scale of zero to ten they six and a half
9869	0	a	and
9870	0	a	but not important is the channel selection ,
9871	0	a	the the
9872	0	a	Oh ,
9873	0	a	the the
9874	0	a	no no no no
9875	0	a	no ,
9876	0	a	that is very important , but w and not important in the audio settings , display settings
9877	0	a	and
9878	0	a	Yeah .
9879	0	a	Okay , that is okay .
9880	0	a	That is a little weird .
9881	0	a	Which channel selection ?
9882	0	a	Oh , okay .
9883	0	a	Okay ,
9884	1	a	we can we can hide those under a menu or something ,
9885	0	a	okay .
9886	0	a	new preferences preferences .
9887	1	a	beep to find your control ,
9888	0	a	was
9889	0	a	that was in the test , the the most people f find it irritating when they cannot find a rem their remote control ,
9890	1	a	so I think it is a bee beep to sound it
9891	1	a	and you can find it .
9892	0	a	That is like a button on your TV ?
9893	0	a	Remote , okay .
9894	0	a	And another thing they want was speech recognition
9895	0	a	so they can say what they want to let is go to channel one and that is kind of things .
9896	0	a	Okay .
9897	1	a	And they want maybe an LCD screen
9898	0	a	to to look it
9899	0	a	wh what is on every channel and what do I want with it ?
9900	0	a	Yeah .
9901	1	a	We want to have a little preview on the remote control .
9902	1	a	Preview what is on the channel .
9903	0	a	Okay .
9904	0	a	Is that manageable ?
9905	0	a	Cause it sounds pretty expensive too .
9906	0	a	That sounds too
9907	0	a	It is possible ,
9908	0	a	but I think it is expensive ,
9909	1	a	but do continue .
9910	0	a	Yeah .
9911	0	a	Okay .
9912	0	a	Yeah .
9913	1	a	my personal preferences is a button for my favourite channel ,
9914	0	a	so I can I dunno ,
9915	0	a	so I can zap to my f quick to my favourite channel
9916	0	a	wh
9917	0	a	what I
9918	1	a	so , the remote mu must see or must see wha what mine preferences are for which channel ,
9919	0	a	so I can zap t to
9920	0	a	What ?
9921	0	a	Yeah .
9922	0	a	Okay ,
9923	1	a	you do not set it yourself , it just remembers the channel that you are on most , for example .
9924	0	a	You want the you want it to be programmed , for example
9925	0	a	y programmed f
9926	0	a	or you want it to recognise your favourite channel ?
9927	0	a	Let is see ,
9928	0	a	you you spend twenty minutes each day on that channel , so it recognises your favourite channel .
9929	0	a	Yeah .
9930	0	a	Recognise
9931	0	a	Yeah .
9932	0	a	Yeah , that is what my personal preference like .
9933	0	a	Okay , so
9934	0	a	it is it
9935	0	a	it does
9936	0	a	it recognise itself , you do not have to set it
9937	0	a	Okay .
9938	0	a	No , itself .
9939	0	a	Maybe it is easier to to sell it ,
9940	0	a	but
9941	0	a	I do not know it is manageable , but we will we will see .
9942	0	a	Okay .
9943	0	a	I see .
9944	0	a	Yeah ,
9945	0	a	it is a little bit
9946	0	a	it is the end of it .
9947	0	a	It is a little bit I lost it , the computer crashed ,
9948	0	a	so .
9949	0	a	Okay .
9950	0	a	Okay .
9951	0	a	No problem , it is it is okay ,
9952	0	a	that is
9953	0	a	Yeah , go ahead .
9954	0	a	Shall I go ?
9955	0	a	Okay .
9956	0	a	Yeah .
9957	0	a	So ,
9958	0	a	some technical functions .
9959	0	a	Darn computer .
9960	0	a	Basically I have some issues which you discussed earlier .
9961	0	a	Yeah .
9962	1	a	let is just start with the method .
9963	0	a	It sounds really easy ,
9964	0	a	what does the user do , what does the th remote control do ,
9965	0	a	but there are quite some issues .
9966	0	a	So
9967	1	a	the things I am going to concentrate on are the user aspect ,
9968	0	a	because the technical aspect , that is pretty much covered .
9969	0	a	We can do that .
9970	0	a	What goes wrong at the user .
9971	0	a	Gets the remote control .
9972	0	a	Where is the remote control ?
9973	0	a	We have all had it once ,
9974	0	a	I want to watch some television , where is the remote control ?
9975	0	a	That was one of your ideas which you posted in the network folder ,
9976	0	a	a really good idea .
9977	0	a	Yeah .
9978	0	a	Yeah .
9979	0	a	That seems very good .
9980	0	a	these are just the issues .
9981	1	a	I come to some personal experience , findings , possible solutions later .
9982	0	a	Searches for the button .
9983	0	a	There are many buttons on a remote control which are not clear .
9984	1	a	so either we lose those or we try to make it a little bit more clear .
9985	0	a	also symbols tend to fade after a while .
9986	0	a	There is nothing more annoying than faded symbols ,
9987	0	a	because you do not know which channel is this button ,
9988	1	a	so possibly we could find something for that ,
9989	0	a	yes .
9990	0	a	Okay , so
9991	1	a	have it more make it more durable actually .
9992	0	a	Okay .
9993	0	a	covered that .
9994	0	a	Oh yes ,
9995	0	a	user presses the button .
9996	0	a	usually when you have a lot of buttons , buttons are small .
9997	0	a	So you press more once remote control goes kablouey or something like that ,
9998	1	a	so we have to pay attention not to put too mun too many buttons on the remote control .
9999	0	a	Okay , so
10000	0	a	the buttons should be
10001	0	a	Yeah .
10002	1	a	And possibly also the size , so more important buttons , bigger
10003	0	a	si
10004	0	a	So
10005	1	a	this is basically what I h had in mind in the fade proof symbols , locator , a sound ,
10006	0	a	so
10007	1	a	clear we should stick to existing symbols , but maybe we could do a little investigation to see whether some symbols are need to be replaced by others .
10008	0	a	Wow .
10009	0	a	The s
10010	0	a	Yeah .
10011	0	a	Make it make them bigger .
10012	1	a	Even more durable .
10013	0	a	Okay .
10014	0	a	This I pretty much covered .
10015	1	a	So what we want to go to is not this one , but more less buttons , easy , some bigger buttons .
10016	0	a	Yeah , it is true .
10017	0	a	Yeah .
10018	0	a	So
10019	0	a	that is basically what I had in mind .
10020	0	a	Yeah , that is clear .
10021	0	a	This is not the final design , this is just a general idea of how I would like to see basically the general idea .
10022	0	a	No , of course
10023	0	a	Yeah .
10024	0	a	I must say that it
10025	0	a	So
10026	0	a	that was it .
10027	0	a	That was it .
10028	0	a	Okay ,
10029	0	a	that was good .
10030	0	a	So we agree on the the part that we need to get something on the on the remote to find it somewhere and increase it the durability of of the thing ,
10031	0	a	so
10032	0	a	The other aspects , we will just see how what you came up with and what is possible for that budget .
10033	0	a	Yeah , I think it is a really good idea .
10034	0	a	Yeah .
10035	0	a	Yeah .
10036	0	a	Okay .
10037	0	a	Okay , that is fine .
10038	0	a	Okay , now
10039	0	a	work a little with me .
10040	0	a	Okay .
10041	0	a	Well ,
10042	1	a	let is start it as it is .
10043	0	a	Okay ,
10044	0	a	the method .
10045	0	a	There are a few questions that need to be answered , you already talked about it a little bit .
10046	1	a	Which buttons are wanted ,
10047	0	a	is our remote control universal or should it be programmable .
10048	1	a	if it should be programmeab grammeale then we need something like a mode that you can switch it .
10049	0	a	Because then the buttons have to send out a different signal then they would normally do .
10050	1	a	And how big is the remote control going to be ?
10051	0	a	I will tell you why that is important to me .
10052	0	a	there are a lot of technical parts in the remote control ,
10053	1	a	so that is why I also would like to say go a little bit easy on the designs ,
10054	0	a	I heard ab you talking about beeps and about video screens , but the material inside and the technical aspects are quite complex already .
10055	1	a	So keep in mind that everything that you keep think of , it has to b to be built .
10056	0	a	So
10057	0	a	it is
10058	0	a	that is not as easy as it s might look like .
10059	0	a	Yeah .
10060	0	a	Of course , .
10061	0	a	Okay .
10062	0	a	material study , I am working on that for the the costs .
10063	1	a	I have to check out how far I can go with that .
10064	0	a	Normally , a circuit board is made of fibreglass and the wires are made of copper .
10065	0	a	that is how it is done and all the remote controls work that way ,
10066	1	a	I think we can just go on with that .
10067	0	a	then I have read more integration of materials means less cost for the production .
10068	0	a	The more we can make at once in one piece , that is cheaper .
10069	0	a	You mean integrate them all into the circuit board .
10070	0	a	Exactly , so if we make a circuit board with the the connections already on it , then that is cheaper .
10071	0	a	Okay .
10072	0	a	Yeah , okay .
10073	1	a	So we have to make something that is not too difficult in design again .
10074	0	a	So you have
10075	0	a	This is what look like looks like if you press one button , so this is not the entire thing .
10076	0	a	You have the the power coming in , then you have like a switch .
10077	0	a	The switch if you p press it then some electrical charge goes into the processor , that thinks over a Morse code ,
10078	1	a	that is how you should see it .
10079	0	a	The Morse code goes to the amplifier , then the signal is sent to two light bulbs .
10080	0	a	You have infrared
10081	0	a	and an interv
10082	0	a	how to say it ?
10083	0	a	a light in indication , light that you know that it is functioning .
10084	0	a	here again , that is my story about the different modes , if you do want to make remote universal , then the processor has to make up a different Morse code when some button is pressed .
10085	0	a	That makes it much more complex ,
10086	0	a	so we really need to have a look , do we want that or not .
10087	0	a	I do not have any personal p preferences so far ,
10088	1	a	except for the materials to be used light , that they are light .
10089	0	a	Okay .
10090	0	a	Okay .
10091	0	a	That was it ?
10092	1	a	I will get back to my thing then .
10093	0	a	That was it .
10094	0	a	Okay ,
10095	0	a	back this up to the screen .
10096	0	a	So
10097	0	a	I got some new information on the project specifications are changing a little .
10098	0	a	Like you said teletext is not not very popular anymore because the the internet , nowadays people do not use the teletext anymore or hardly ,
10099	0	a	so it can either
10100	0	a	Well ,
10101	1	a	I do not think we should remove the button ,
10102	0	a	because there are always people who are using it .
10103	0	a	Yeah .
10104	1	a	But I do not think it should be very it should be one of the big buttons for example .
10105	1	a	Just put it somewhere or under second option or whatever .
10106	0	a	It is not important anymore .
10107	0	a	we are targeting young people now ,
10108	0	a	because our
10109	0	a	This is a new product and with this new product we want to appeal to younger people ,
10110	0	a	which are
10111	0	a	the younger people were defined under forty .
10112	0	a	Yeah .
10113	0	a	I
10114	0	a	so I think it is
10115	0	a	that is also good with the fashion and everything ,
10116	0	a	so yeah .
10117	0	a	B
10118	0	a	Yeah ,
10119	0	a	and they want to pay for it
10120	0	a	and With more Where
10121	0	a	with more technical specifications
10122	0	a	in the
10123	0	a	Yeah .
10124	0	a	They want to pay for it , people are willing to spend money actually to buy a remote that they like .
10125	0	a	If they like the way it looks , the way it functions , so they are actually going to spend spend money on it .
10126	0	a	Yeah .
10127	0	a	see how far we can go with it anyway , so And one thing that should be important is that the corporate l colour and slogan are recognisable , which is apparently black and yellow ,
10128	0	a	but I am not sure if we
10129	1	a	I think we should keep the the logo in mind ,
10130	0	a	because with colours you can have a lot of fashionable colours and everything on it , which suits everybody is taste .
10131	0	a	So
10132	1	a	With that concept I started thinking , so why not just steal Nokia is idea and just make changeable covers for your
10133	0	a	I mean those cost hardly anything I think , and people could even spend extra money on buying a cover and so have an entire new remote control that they like to see .
10134	0	a	Oh .
10135	0	a	Yeah .
10136	0	a	Or we can sh
10137	1	a	for example we can make a different a basic design .
10138	1	a	And sell the covers separately , for example .
10139	0	a	That is just a little marketing idea that could be applied ,
10140	0	a	so you can p
10141	0	a	it appeals to really everyone .
10142	1	a	So you do not have to I think you do not have to make entire remote controls .
10143	1	a	We make a basic one and manufacture this cover separately .
10144	0	a	So
10145	0	a	that was that was my idea on what we could do to appeal this product to everyone .
10146	0	a	So
10147	0	a	just
10148	1	a	I am not sure if you came up with anything in the meantime , after making a presentation .
10149	0	a	Yeah .
10150	1	a	Would you like to share ?
10151	0	a	Okay .
10152	0	a	No ,
10153	0	a	I think this is a good idea .
10154	0	a	But
10155	1	a	Go ahead .
10156	0	a	But oh ?
10157	0	a	Yeah ,
10158	0	a	with with an LCD screen you can
10159	0	a	Why ?
10160	0	a	Nokia w
10161	0	a	Is it manageable ?
10162	0	a	Is it easy ?
10163	0	a	Yeah .
10164	0	a	Oh yeah .
10165	1	a	I think we should lose the LCD screen ,
10166	0	a	like you said .
10167	0	a	Y
10168	0	a	Yes , I think so too .
10169	0	a	I think for example it is it is huge
10170	0	a	I think the LCD is huge , it consumes batteries like hell .
10171	0	a	I think it takes up a lot of a lot of power .
10172	0	a	And it costs too much to fabricate , so we are on a tight budget here .
10173	0	a	It costs a lot , I think .
10174	0	a	Okay ,
10175	0	a	Okay .
10176	1	a	What we could do , what could be possible , is maybe not an LCD screen but with a preview ,
10177	0	a	but y
10178	0	a	I am not sure if it is even possible .
10179	1	a	For example , a little TV guide .
10180	0	a	Like you have a little
10181	1	a	just just a text only , not colour , just a little text thing
10182	0	a	so you can use your remote as a TV guide .
10183	0	a	Yeah .
10184	0	a	I am not sure it is even possible ,
10185	0	a	but maybe okay , make it
10186	0	a	Yeah ,
10187	0	a	find a little compromise in that ,
10188	0	a	but
10189	0	a	What did I write down ?
10190	0	a	I think the p yeah , the beep is a very simple thing to imple implement , just make a button on your TV and just hit the button , it beeps somewhere .
10191	1	a	I have to check that out ,
10192	0	a	I am not sure .
10193	0	a	Yeah .
10194	0	a	That must be possible .
10195	0	a	I think it is easy to implement ,
10196	0	a	we should go for that .
10197	0	a	Ja .
10198	0	a	I am sorry ,
10199	0	a	whe where do you want to hit the T you want to
10200	0	a	we want a button on the television .
10201	0	a	And it is
10202	1	a	Maybe just a slap on sticker with a button which sends out a small signal .
10203	0	a	speech recognition .
10204	0	a	I thin
10205	0	a	Yeah ,
10206	1	a	I mean where else should you put it ?
10207	0	a	Yeah ,
10208	0	a	but how are you going to use that if your
10209	1	a	I mean if your remote control is lost , how are you going to press where are you going to press the button ?
10210	0	a	A slap on sticker .
10211	0	a	In th
10212	0	a	okay ,
10213	0	a	but that rules out a universal remote control .
10214	0	a	Because that is not possible .
10215	0	a	Yeah .
10216	0	a	Exactly .
10217	0	a	Oh ,
10218	0	a	you mean as like a separate thing you can attach to your TV .
10219	0	a	Yeah , exactly .
10220	0	a	Yeah , that could be possible .
10221	0	a	A little little box you can attach to your TV is fine then , okay .
10222	0	a	Okay ,
10223	1	a	then I would I would like to know now if we want the universal remote control or not ,
10224	0	a	because that is determines everything I am going to do .
10225	1	a	I think it is universal .
10226	1	a	I think we should go for universal ,
10227	0	a	because apparently we are a separate company making separate c remote controls to sell to a lot of diverse people .
10228	0	a	If not
10229	0	a	Okay .
10230	0	a	Yeah .
10231	0	a	I think universal remote control should be possible .
10232	0	a	Everyone wants to buy it ,
10233	0	a	so we w
10234	0	a	yeah .
10235	0	a	Okay ,
10236	0	a	then I go for that .
10237	0	a	Yeah ,
10238	0	a	I think we are targeting everyone ,
10239	0	a	so remote
10240	0	a	Okay , universal is good .
10241	0	a	Yeah .
10242	0	a	Okay .
10243	0	a	No ,
10244	0	a	it is fine with me ,
10245	0	a	but then I know what to look for .
10246	0	a	Speech recognition , I think it is very hard ,
10247	0	a	because we are selling across multiple countries .
10248	0	a	So I think implementing speech recognition is such a small apparatus , it is very hard to do .
10249	0	a	Yeah .
10250	0	a	Or one .
10251	0	a	Or when you say one two i it it is enough ,
10252	0	a	right ?
10253	0	a	But
10254	0	a	Oh yeah .
10255	0	a	And it is
10256	0	a	Besides that , the technology is not really super yet ,
10257	0	a	so that is a problem in implementing this .
10258	0	a	Yeah ,
10259	0	a	but I do not see Arabian people speaking one , two whatever .
10260	0	a	It is
10261	0	a	Yeah .
10262	0	a	Yeah .
10263	0	a	It is not a mature technology , I think it takes a lot of memory and everything in in a remote control ,
10264	0	a	so
10265	0	a	I do not think it should be implemented in a remote control yet .
10266	0	a	Okay .
10267	0	a	It is a good idea , but it is just not I do not think the market is ripe for that yet .
10268	0	a	Uh huh .
10269	0	a	Yeah .
10270	0	a	What else do we have ?
10271	0	a	well
10272	1	a	you should you should look into the in into the materials that are real durable .
10273	0	a	So the the the symbols wo not fade ,
10274	1	a	maybe a little harder plastic
10275	0	a	or especially li we do not
10276	1	a	maybe we do not have have to do all the buttons , but especially the ones that are the popular buttons ,
10277	0	a	so those always fade first .
10278	0	a	Exactly .
10279	0	a	I already noted that .
10280	0	a	, okay .
10281	0	a	Okay .
10282	0	a	the thing is the most important things that we have now .
10283	0	a	Let is see .
10284	1	a	If we make a remote control with changeable covers , then we can also make a cover for every language area .
10285	0	a	That is fo is
10286	1	a	especially for older people , that they can read it read it in their own language .
10287	1	a	For example ?
10288	0	a	Well ,
10289	0	a	we are not we are not targeting older people ,
10290	1	a	we should remember that .
10291	0	a	Yeah .
10292	0	a	Everything we target is under forty ,
10293	0	a	so .
10294	0	a	That is
10295	0	a	okay
10296	0	a	, okay .
10297	1	a	You assume that that they read correctly
10298	0	a	and I think they are
10299	0	a	The most important thing about young people is that they are really sensitive to to trends that are passing through the world ,
10300	0	a	so
10301	0	a	No , of course .
10302	0	a	Huh .
10303	0	a	But b But every
10304	0	a	Oh .
10305	0	a	okay .
10306	0	a	But should the exchangeable covers include the buttons themselves
10307	0	a	or just the C
10308	0	a	that is a problem with the with the text then .
10309	0	a	No ,
10310	1	a	I think it is just something you you put over them ,
10311	0	a	because
10312	0	a	Yeah we c
10313	0	a	Yeah , you ca
10314	0	a	Well ,
10315	0	a	tha that is not a that is not a bad that is not even
10316	0	a	it is not even a bad idea .
10317	0	a	I mean , for example , if you are if you are into the durability issue
10318	0	a	you could
10319	1	a	For example , if your buttons are faded , after I mean if you make a durable remote , they are faded , you can just buy a new cover .
10320	0	a	I am not sure it is it is hard to make .
10321	0	a	Okay .
10322	0	a	but I know that the buttons are like a Nokia telephone on one sleeve ,
10323	0	a	so you do not have to change your whole cover .
10324	0	a	So it is a good and a bad idea .
10325	1	a	we can make something that you can only remove the sleeve .
10326	0	a	Know what I mean ?
10327	0	a	It works the same as a Nokia telephone ,
10328	0	a	it is it is in my kay .
10329	0	a	Oh yeah ,
10330	0	a	I know what you mean .
10331	0	a	Yeah , I know ,
10332	0	a	it is just just a one one piece of rubber for example ,
10333	0	a	okay .
10334	0	a	Yeah .
10335	0	a	Exactly .
10336	0	a	Yeah .
10337	0	a	Yeah ,
10338	0	a	that is what I
10339	1	a	something I have to look into .
10340	0	a	Either either change both the buttons and and the cover or just the cover ,
10341	0	a	I am not sure which which is easier ,
10342	0	a	so
10343	0	a	anyway , yeah ,
10344	0	a	this is what we are going to do afterwards , just lunch break and have more individual work after that ,
10345	0	a	so let is see what we let is see we
10346	0	a	So
10347	0	a	you have to come up with a components concept ,
10348	0	a	yeah .
10349	0	a	I want some
10350	0	a	you should do some trend watching , because even if we are if we are going to do those covers and everything , what people really want , that is what we need to know in this phase ,
10351	0	a	because that is going to be the essential final design that we are going to come up with .
10352	0	a	Yeah .
10353	0	a	Yeah .
10354	0	a	Okay .
10355	0	a	Yeah ,
10356	0	a	I think user interface is fairly obvious .
10357	1	a	I mean it should be very intuitive ,
10358	0	a	s
10359	0	a	Yeah ,
10360	1	a	it should speak for itself .
10361	0	a	Pretty straightforward .
10362	0	a	for example I bought a remote control last week with a new TV ,
10363	0	a	it was it l
10364	0	a	it is like all buttons
10365	0	a	and you have no idea what it does at first , and I am total TV new , anyway .
10366	0	a	So
10367	1	a	I think it should be have less or l very little buttons and maybe a second second level menu for the advanced things .
10368	1	a	Or maybe just stick them under a menu ,
10369	0	a	like you said the the sound options and the surround and whatever , they are more complicated ,
10370	1	a	just stick them under one menu
10371	0	a	and give it a
10372	1	a	just put it in in s in a software piece , you can menu and you can select everything you want to to set on your TV .
10373	0	a	Is it techni technically possible to send a signal to a television and then pops up a menu ,
10374	0	a	because we are working with different types of television ,
10375	0	a	so we are going to work with that ?
10376	0	a	It is an in built menu ,
10377	0	a	is not it ?
10378	0	a	Yes .
10379	0	a	Yeah .
10380	0	a	That is true .
10381	0	a	I do not think so .
10382	0	a	No , that is true .
10383	0	a	No , I do not think so .
10384	0	a	Because the television needs to respond to the signal ,
10385	0	a	and if it does not know how , it is
10386	0	a	Exactly ,
10387	0	a	that is not possible .
10388	0	a	Yeah , that is true .
10389	0	a	So basically
10390	0	a	we
10391	1	a	Or we could use a double sided for less used functions
10392	0	a	you
10393	0	a	Yeah ,
10394	1	a	with the cover .
10395	0	a	I am not sure if it is impossible ,
10396	0	a	but there is a chance it is not ,
10397	0	a	so .
10398	0	a	A double sided remote control ?
10399	0	a	I do not think that is useful .
10400	0	a	I
10401	0	a	it is basically an idea to overcome these issues ,
10402	0	a	because
10403	0	a	No ,
10404	0	a	but basic functions
10405	1	a	but functions which are not frequently used .
10406	0	a	Yeah ,
10407	0	a	but then you are going to have a lot of wasted buttons .
10408	0	a	For example you have a Sony TV and the half of the buttons wo not function if you have a for a Sony that wo not for a Philips TV .
10409	0	a	Yeah .
10410	0	a	Because if we use a universal remote control , we are going to have to have most buttons on it ,
10411	0	a	so
10412	0	a	Yeah .
10413	0	a	I do not think we should
10414	0	a	Yeah ,
10415	0	a	for exam I am not s
10416	0	a	yeah ,
10417	0	a	for ex
10418	0	a	you have to make it a little decision between the part if you want a universal remote control that it should do what people usually do with their TVs , not not the very complicated settings
10419	0	a	that you can usually do that with either a old old remote control if they really hate that thing , but you ca not you cannot take into consideration all the different brands of TVs .
10420	0	a	yeah .
10421	0	a	But that might be broken .
10422	0	a	I think there is
10423	0	a	I think there is a standard for example between because usually the the menu is
10424	0	a	the menu button is is usable between different brands .
10425	0	a	Especially the big ones , the big brands ,
10426	0	a	so .
10427	0	a	Cause everybody
10428	0	a	I have a universal remote control and it can use the menu button ,
10429	0	a	so I think
10430	0	a	I am not sure ,
10431	1	a	if you can put some research into that , if it is possible .
10432	0	a	I think just a b
10433	0	a	and the navigation is very basic , it is usually the same thing .
10434	0	a	okay .
10435	0	a	But I think there must be a way to invoke the more complicated functions of a television .
10436	1	a	For instance , if your old remote control is broken and you buy ours , then you should be able to get everything out of the television that is in it .
10437	0	a	Yeah .
10438	0	a	Yeah , that is true .
10439	0	a	Yeah .
10440	0	a	Because otherwise you will lose functions by buying our
10441	0	a	Okay , I thi I think so too .
10442	0	a	I think so
10443	1	a	we need to put some research into that if if we can open the menu ,
10444	0	a	I think it is possible ,
10445	1	a	just the way how to .
10446	0	a	Yeah .
10447	0	a	Yeah ,
10448	0	a	yeah .
10449	0	a	Yeah ,
10450	0	a	then then you could do everything I suppose , because usually the TVs have tha
10451	0	a	that inside in this other little piece of software ,
10452	0	a	so it is okay .
10453	1	a	And I think that our r remote control should not look like any other .
10454	0	a	For instance Sony makes all their remote controls exactly the same for all their devices , and you always grab the wrong one because formatting of the buttons is exactly the same , only the labels are different .
10455	0	a	Yeah .
10456	0	a	Yeah I think it should be a little distinct from everything else ,
10457	0	a	because it is either it is both mayb
10458	1	a	maybe the shape can be a little different .
10459	1	a	We should not do that .
10460	0	a	Exactly .
10461	0	a	Yeah .
10462	0	a	Yeah ,
10463	0	a	I have some ideas .
10464	0	a	I have some ideas .
10465	1	a	Maybe it is a little more curves or whatever .
10466	0	a	yeah .
10467	0	a	that is your division .
10468	1	a	And with different colours .
10469	0	a	So
10470	0	a	Yeah ,
10471	0	a	this .
10472	1	a	I will put some on paper and present them next time the ideas that I have .
10473	0	a	Not sure what
10474	0	a	because we have forty minutes , I am not sure how much time we have left for the meeting anyway ,
10475	0	a	so .
10476	0	a	Okay .
10477	0	a	I heard a beep go .
10478	0	a	Yeah ,
10479	0	a	but it was not me , it was him closing something .
10480	0	a	Yeah .
10481	0	a	So anyway
10482	0	a	, yeah ,
10483	1	a	we could do some
10484	1	a	i do some work now on on the design for example .
10485	1	a	I mean what do you want ,
10486	0	a	do you want , but
10487	0	a	Yeah ,
10488	0	a	may maybe something like this .
10489	0	a	Yeah ,
10490	1	a	but we like some some curves
10491	0	a	or
10492	0	a	Yeah .
10493	1	a	But though smooth inside .
10494	1	a	So you have the transmitter here for example .
10495	1	a	Let is see that you what would be handy .
10496	1	a	I think that the the buttons should be the channel buttons should be on their own .
10497	1	a	And a light
10498	0	a	Volume .
10499	0	a	Let is see
10500	0	a	one , two
10501	0	a	God damn it .
10502	0	a	Oh ,
10503	0	a	we get the general ideas , yes .
10504	0	a	Yeah , okay .
10505	0	a	Another one here .
10506	0	a	Let is see what I think this should
10507	0	a	these are always on top of the of the control ,
10508	1	a	so they should be here .
10509	0	a	Yeah ,
10510	0	a	and since you are holding it like this , I suggest you put the channel up channel down and volume
10511	0	a	yeah yeah .
10512	0	a	Think it is like this .
10513	0	a	Withi within the
10514	0	a	Yeah ,
10515	1	a	just take it .
10516	0	a	So
10517	1	a	you have the up channel the down channel
10518	0	a	the volume , do we want that horizontal or vertical ?
10519	0	a	This is basically what people are accustomed to ,
10520	0	a	so
10521	0	a	Yeah ,
10522	0	a	but this is just a g general idea .
10523	0	a	Do you take triangles
10524	0	a	or I think it should be
10525	0	a	I think it
10526	1	a	Maybe we should make them bigger or whatever .
10527	0	a	it is it is fine , I think .
10528	0	a	Yeah .
10529	0	a	Oh d
10530	0	a	Yeah .
10531	0	a	Yeah .
10532	1	a	maybe the menu button can go i in the middle .
10533	0	a	Yeah , in the middle .
10534	0	a	It is it is usually there ,
10535	0	a	but
10536	0	a	Whoa .
10537	1	a	Perhaps we should also make something like a flash on it , if you if it is lost , for people that are deaf .
10538	0	a	They they wo not hear the the beep .
10539	0	a	Yeah ,
10540	0	a	but for example if it is lost in your armchair , we will not see the flash .
10541	0	a	You wo not be able to find it .
10542	0	a	Yeah .
10543	0	a	And flash takes up a lot of batteries again .
10544	0	a	Yeah , it is true ,
10545	0	a	but it is it is only has to do so when you press the button that it is lost .
10546	0	a	Just
10547	1	a	And LED on it .
10548	0	a	Yeah .
10549	1	a	We could make a combination that it goes beep and that you that some light lights up .
10550	0	a	So .
10551	0	a	deaf people ?
10552	0	a	I have another idea , I am not sure if it is possible .
10553	0	a	Yeah ,
10554	0	a	I thought about for deaf people for example ,
10555	0	a	so .
10556	0	a	We could do that .
10557	1	a	Just a light on it
10558	0	a	or
10559	0	a	Very important .
10560	0	a	let is see .
10561	0	a	So we have the basic channels we have got here ,
10562	0	a	the power button somewhere over here ?
10563	0	a	I usually press it on top .
10564	0	a	Oh yeah , it is true .
10565	1	a	that thing should be central .
10566	0	a	You should not be
10567	0	a	you should not press it by accident ,
10568	1	a	but it should not be stacked away somewhere .
10569	0	a	Oh ,
10570	0	a	that is It is
10571	0	a	And But you r
10572	0	a	And you are reading from the t
10573	0	a	you always read from the top to the the bottom of it .
10574	0	a	At least that is what I am accustomed to .
10575	0	a	Yeah .
10576	0	a	Yeah ,
10577	0	a	like that is going to work .
10578	0	a	What would you like to ?
10579	0	a	Okay ,
10580	0	a	mute button .
10581	0	a	Yeah ,
10582	1	a	I thought maybe we should move the buttons down and put it here for example
10583	0	a	to
10584	0	a	From top to bottom .
10585	0	a	Yeah , that is true ,
10586	0	a	you should
10587	1	a	I think the bu the power button should be on top ,
10588	0	a	cause it is the first thing you do , turn it on .
10589	0	a	Yeah ,
10590	0	a	so it is
10591	0	a	Yeah .
10592	0	a	So power button on top .
10593	0	a	Mute .
10594	0	a	Is that somewhere here ?
10595	0	a	Is that used often ?
10596	0	a	The mute button ?
10597	0	a	Do people use that often ?
10598	0	a	Cause I am pretty much accustomed to it right over here , at least in general ,
10599	0	a	but
10600	0	a	It is not that important , no .
10601	0	a	Do we hardly
10602	1	a	I think it should be at the bottom somewhere .
10603	0	a	So i it is
10604	0	a	sorry ?
10605	0	a	No , it is no .
10606	0	a	Mute .
10607	0	a	Turn the sound off .
10608	0	a	I do not think it is important ,
10609	0	a	but I think it I think it should be you c
10610	1	a	you could put it somewhere here .
10611	1	a	Or or with the volume selection .
10612	0	a	No ,
10613	0	a	because it
10614	0	a	Yeah ,
10615	0	a	people are accustomed to that ,
10616	0	a	it is
10617	1	a	Can I have that ?
10618	0	a	That is j
10619	0	a	Take this out and here see
10620	0	a	are we going to take triangles anyway ?
10621	0	a	I am drawing triangles , but
10622	0	a	Yeah ,
10623	1	a	it is maybe a bigger lesser than thing .
10624	1	a	Around not not at top at the around the volume selection .
10625	0	a	I do not know where exactly ,
10626	0	a	but Wha
10627	0	a	No .
10628	0	a	Sure .
10629	0	a	That is pretty much what people are accustomed to ,
10630	0	a	are not they ?
10631	0	a	Well ,
10632	0	a	I am accustomed to the channels being on top .
10633	0	a	So anyway ,
10634	1	a	I think this is should be the channels
10635	0	a	and or sh
10636	1	a	Here ,
10637	0	a	okay .
10638	0	a	Yeah .
10639	0	a	Yeah , me too .
10640	0	a	Yeah , that is better .
10641	0	a	Okay ,
10642	0	a	should we chan
10643	0	a	okay ,
10644	1	a	this two , channel up and down .
10645	0	a	On the right .
10646	0	a	Shall we also look if it is possible to make a rechargeable remote ?
10647	0	a	That you do not have to buy new batteries if every
10648	0	a	, yeah .
10649	0	a	Yeah .
10650	0	a	Well ,
10651	0	a	for that is it is
10652	0	a	on one part it is it is a good thing to recharge it
10653	0	a	Maybe we should what
10654	0	a	what could be possible is one with rechargeable batteries for example .
10655	0	a	Maybe it is more ex expensive .
10656	0	a	You have
10657	0	a	just put Penlite batteries that are rechargeable ,
10658	0	a	because it is an it is
10659	0	a	it is it is very annoying .
10660	0	a	But that is already possible .
10661	0	a	But is not that expensive in the entire package ?
10662	0	a	But again , is not that too expensive ?
10663	0	a	Cause that means that we have to implement rechargeable batteries , a docking station
10664	0	a	And do people actually want that ?
10665	0	a	To pay extra they want to pay for rechargeable ?
10666	0	a	Can can we save this or
10667	0	a	Yeah .
10668	0	a	Yeah .
10669	0	a	I am not sure y I am not sure it is if it is expensive ,
10670	1	a	but just take a look at it ,
10671	0	a	because it might be a very good idea .
10672	0	a	Because if it is it is useful to have it rechargeable , but at the same time , if you do not want recha if you forgot to recharge it
10673	0	a	and you want to watch TV now , you want to be able to put different batteries in it , use it now and not in half an hour .
10674	0	a	Yes .
10675	0	a	Yes .
10676	0	a	Okay .
10677	0	a	you could make a device , but I am not sure how that is possible with the costs , that you can put in normal batteries , rechargeable ,
10678	0	a	but it you are
10679	1	a	the remote also can act as a recharger .
10680	0	a	I think I have a nice idea .
10681	0	a	So then you can choose , you have every decision .
10682	0	a	Know what I mean ?
10683	1	a	You can put in normal Penlites , rechargeable Penlites , but they can also be recharged with the remote , with a wire .
10684	0	a	Not exactly .
10685	0	a	Yeah yeah .
10686	0	a	I think it is it is a pretty good idea
10687	1	a	to have like sort of a maybe a base station that you put on the TV .
10688	0	a	So but
10689	0	a	But I think that will cost a lot .
10690	0	a	Yeah ,
10691	0	a	that is g
10692	0	a	But Which
10693	0	a	Yeah .
10694	1	a	Could be flat , you could insert your remote into it .
10695	0	a	a normal wire would be better .
10696	0	a	I am not sure .
10697	0	a	Like a like a PDA , a hand held .
10698	0	a	A what ?
10699	0	a	Well ,
10700	0	a	we were talking about the fact that we wanted to insert either a beep or a flash into the thing with a little separate signal
10701	0	a	or
10702	1	a	So you could put that on a TV for example .
10703	0	a	You can just put it in the electricity and it charges itself , you do not need basic station .
10704	0	a	Yes .
10705	0	a	That is possible , that is true .
10706	1	a	It could be very flat , could be very small .
10707	0	a	It is a very small
10708	0	a	Yeah ,
10709	0	a	I am drawing it big now ,
10710	0	a	but
10711	1	a	So you can put your remote on flat for example .
10712	1	a	And at the backside of remote just just just a little hole for example you just put it down , it recharges for example .
10713	0	a	Yeah .
10714	0	a	Yeah .
10715	0	a	I do not think it is very expensive .
10716	0	a	Yeah .
10717	0	a	I am not sure if it costs a lot ,
10718	0	a	that that is what he r
10719	0	a	That is that you
10720	0	a	that is what you buy yourself .
10721	0	a	Yes .
10722	1	a	I am going to try to find that out .
10723	0	a	I am not sure if there is information available on this ,
10724	0	a	but
10725	0	a	It is just an idea ,
10726	1	a	we have to find out if it is possible .
10727	0	a	But
10728	0	a	Yeah , they want to pay for it .
10729	0	a	Do they want
10730	0	a	but they want a rechargeable one ?
10731	0	a	I am not sure ,
10732	1	a	you should find out if it is if rechargeable is important .
10733	0	a	Yeah .
10734	0	a	Th there was not a el ask esque
10735	0	a	But
10736	0	a	But f
10737	0	a	Yeah .
10738	0	a	These are comfort issues .
10739	0	a	So I think people will pay they wanted to pay for comfort .
10740	0	a	Well ,
10741	0	a	this is comfort .
10742	0	a	They want to pay for comfort ,
10743	0	a	we just assu we
10744	1	a	we could either make a separate station which just sends a signal to the remote control to either beep or flash to find it ,
10745	0	a	and Yeah ,
10746	1	a	we have to either that or make it integrated with a with a docking station .
10747	0	a	Yes .
10748	0	a	Yeah .
10749	0	a	Exactly .
10750	0	a	I think this is a brilliant product .
10751	0	a	I would buy it myself .
10752	0	a	I think it would be good actually .
10753	0	a	I like the beep part anyway .
10754	0	a	So
10755	0	a	let is go through the
10756	0	a	Covers is covers is good .
10757	0	a	I like the covers .
10758	0	a	That is a brilliant idea .
10759	0	a	I never thought
10760	0	a	I hope if I have information about that ,
10761	0	a	I am going to
10762	0	a	Yeah ,
10763	0	a	it is
10764	0	a	Oh
10765	0	a	we can save this .
10766	1	a	Up and saved .
10767	0	a	We even saved the ant .
10768	0	a	Okay .
10769	0	a	So
10770	0	a	what we have is you have
10771	0	a	I think you have to do a lot of work on if it is possible for the cost .
10772	0	a	Maybe
10773	0	a	yeah ,
10774	1	a	or maybe you can find out i what people are willing to pay .
10775	0	a	Yeah .
10776	0	a	We are going for twenty five Euros sales price ,
10777	1	a	but just try to find out what they are willing to pay for it , because if they are willing to pay more , we could lose a little profit and maybe attract more customers ,
10778	0	a	we just have to see what it looks like .
10779	0	a	Yeah , okay .
10780	0	a	Yeah
10781	0	a	yeah
10782	0	a	yeah .
10783	0	a	Yeah .
10784	0	a	Yeah .
10785	1	a	I would like to make a decision .
10786	1	a	What it costs and what kind of materials that we can choose what we want in it
10787	0	a	and
10788	0	a	exactly , I need it .
10789	0	a	Yeah , if you have some financial information that that would be nice ,
10790	0	a	so .
10791	1	a	Could you post some other essentials of what people want ,
10792	0	a	so that I can work with some buttons , where to put it You seem to have information on that , I would like to see some of it .
10793	0	a	Yeah .
10794	0	a	Was it not possible to send emails around the office ?
10795	0	a	Not .
10796	0	a	No , it was not was not allo
10797	0	a	it was possible , not allowed ,
10798	0	a	so .
10799	0	a	No , it is not .
10800	0	a	No .
10801	0	a	So that is why I am not sure that you are allowed to share documents on the on the draft .
10802	0	a	Yeah .
10803	0	a	My computer crashed ,
10804	0	a	so
10805	0	a	I lost my presentation ,
10806	0	a	but I have the
10807	0	a	Yeah ,
10808	0	a	but I
10809	0	a	Here I have the the s the homepage of our internet ,
10810	0	a	and here is my
10811	0	a	here is my marketing report ,
10812	1	a	maybe you ca you can look at that
10813	0	a	and
10814	0	a	yeah .
10815	0	a	Yeah , okay .
10816	0	a	I do not care .
10817	0	a	I have not heard any complaints yet ,
10818	0	a	so .
10819	0	a	Oh , your computer .
10820	0	a	Okay .
10821	0	a	Yeah ,
10822	0	a	the oh , they inc
10823	0	a	they include the new one .
10824	0	a	Well ,
10825	0	a	I have your PowerPoint presentation , I can get some inf information out of that .
10826	0	a	Let is see .
10827	0	a	Or just for you .
10828	0	a	Oh ,
10829	0	a	where would we
10830	1	a	Where would we want the teletext button ?
10831	0	a	Because we decided that it is n not that important .
10832	0	a	Oh
10833	0	a	no , I did not have that .
10834	0	a	And one And wha what people want
10835	0	a	, I have
10836	0	a	I have another thing
10837	0	a	Yeah .
10838	0	a	All it tells just let is make make a new
10839	1	a	tick the new one .
10840	0	a	Do we put it somewhere over here ?
10841	1	a	Or maybe this is something for the next meeting ,
10842	1	a	I can draw out some ideas .
10843	1	a	other side .
10844	0	a	Yeah ,
10845	1	a	let is increase it a little
10846	0	a	because
10847	0	a	Yeah ,
10848	1	a	draw us up some some designs of of possible just keep in mind that the important buttons should be on top and either big ,
10849	0	a	so the more less important
10850	0	a	More or less .
10851	0	a	Yeah .
10852	0	a	Well ,
10853	0	a	we have decided more or less the basic structure .
10854	1	a	I can put the other buttons in
10855	0	a	Yeah .
10856	1	a	Just play a little with this ,
10857	0	a	put l
10858	1	a	shift a little up or down and we will see what looks best .
10859	0	a	What what did you want to say ?
10860	1	a	Or just po post your designs from time to time on the product share .
10861	0	a	what I al already said is the the the remote controls are always lost , but it it is also for people , they want to learn it fast ,
10862	0	a	not they want to
10863	0	a	No
10864	0	a	It is
10865	0	a	yeah ,
10866	0	a	it is easy to learn
10867	0	a	wi and And
10868	0	a	The If If
10869	0	a	Another thing I want to say is that we are looking at the market for the age younger than forty .
10870	0	a	Yeah .
10871	0	a	Maybe another idea .
10872	0	a	Yeah , so
10873	1	a	we do not want we want very little buttons , just the buttons you use a lot .
10874	0	a	Yes ,
10875	0	a	but it should cover all the functions ,
10876	0	a	so possibly , just an idea that popped in
10877	0	a	Yeah ,
10878	1	a	but we could go a step further ,
10879	0	a	because some TVs have the possibility to adjust brightness , that kind of menus .
10880	0	a	Well
10881	0	a	what
10882	0	a	we had function that what people do ,
10883	0	a	so .
10884	0	a	People change channels , people they change the volume and they they change channel , they turn TV off and on , for example .
10885	0	a	That is the basic fu
10886	0	a	that is what you do I am not sure who present that again , but those are the basic function that people use it for ,
10887	1	a	so those should be very well represented .
10888	0	a	That is true ,
10889	1	a	but that is what we stick under the menu button .
10890	0	a	Everything is
10891	0	a	you say in every TV that is configured under the menu .
10892	0	a	Yes ,
10893	0	a	but it Because we are making
10894	1	a	We need to adjust to the technology .
10895	0	a	But that is the question ,
10896	0	a	is it ?
10897	0	a	Because it needs to be configured in the television under the menu .
10898	0	a	Yeah , but
10899	0	a	But I think most modern TVs have it in their menu .
10900	0	a	If it is not , then we cannot reach it .
10901	0	a	I think so too .
10902	0	a	I think so too .
10903	0	a	True .
10904	0	a	is not there a possibility to do research on that , so we know that for sure ?
10905	0	a	If you rule out functions , then and that gets known , then people are not going to buy it .
10906	0	a	Then the consumer bond or something says you cannot do this and that with it .
10907	0	a	No , I thi
10908	0	a	Oh , we are not going to be able to sell it for twenty five then , with an LCD screen .
10909	0	a	That is a bad bad com commercial
10910	0	a	for
10911	0	a	okay .
10912	0	a	we will we will see what we can come up with .
10913	0	a	Under forty .
10914	0	a	Yeah ? .
10915	0	a	That is true .
10916	0	a	on my report , I did not ish I did not show it in my presentation , because my computer crashed .
10917	0	a	Yeah yeah .
10918	0	a	they want to pay for an LCD screen and speech recognition .
10919	0	a	The want to pay for
10920	0	a	Oh .
10921	0	a	So
10922	0	a	i
10923	0	a	yeah .
10924	0	a	Did they really said it like that ?
10925	0	a	Those two things .
10926	0	a	Yeah ,
10927	0	a	and
10928	0	a	Yeah .
10929	0	a	Do they realise how much that costs ?
10930	0	a	That is almost undoable .
10931	0	a	shall we ?
10932	0	a	Younger , age sixteen and forty five .
10933	0	a	but If if they
10934	0	a	So
10935	0	a	we can
10936	1	a	We can look at the possibilities for an LCD
10937	0	a	and
10938	0	a	I dunno .
10939	0	a	That is all here ,
10940	0	a	here it says
10941	0	a	Yeah ,
10942	0	a	age sixteen forty fi interest in main features more critical .
10943	0	a	No ,
10944	0	a	that is that is .
10945	0	a	Even if i if we have this lost unit , then we cannot do it for that price .
10946	0	a	Okay , so
10947	0	a	we are not focusing on this .
10948	0	a	All the interest in features , not really the LC
10949	0	a	oh
10950	0	a	here .
10951	0	a	Would you pay for speech recognition in a remote control .
10952	0	a	, okay ?
10953	0	a	Speech recognition is quite
10954	0	a	Yeah , just look at the possibilities then ,
10955	0	a	because if
10956	0	a	apparently it is what people want , it is supposed to be a luxurious remote , maybe it is not even that expensive .
10957	0	a	Yeah , that is true .
10958	0	a	Yeah .
10959	1	a	How much it will cost
10960	0	a	and It will come
10961	0	a	Yeah .
10962	1	a	Or find a compromise , maybe just a black and white or for some extra information on it , on your programmes .
10963	0	a	I
10964	0	a	But I really need finance information .
10965	0	a	Well
10966	0	a	I doubt it ,
10967	0	a	but
10968	0	a	Well ,
10969	0	a	I had basically
10970	1	a	Something like this .
10971	0	a	Me too .
10972	0	a	I mean we all do .
10973	0	a	We all do .
10974	0	a	Right .
10975	0	a	I think it is something we should put into consideration .
10976	0	a	Apparently it is what people want ,
10977	0	a	so .
10978	1	a	We should see if what it costs , if it is possible .
10979	0	a	Yeah .
10980	0	a	Yeah ,
10981	1	a	we should do a little thing about design ,
10982	0	a	because it looks boring really to me .
10983	0	a	Even if you put it even if you put a different cover on it , it looks still looks boring ,
10984	0	a	so .
10985	0	a	Different colours maybe .
10986	1	a	And the design , it should differ .
10987	0	a	But all
10988	0	a	Okay .
10989	0	a	This is Philips ,
10990	0	a	huh ?
10991	0	a	Philips has this .
10992	0	a	I have no clue .
10993	0	a	I just drew something what which would fit into your hand easily .
10994	0	a	Okay .
10995	1	a	To make it kind of futuristic .
10996	0	a	Oh ,
10997	1	a	I realise if we make it small , then it needs to be a little thicker ,
10998	0	a	because I need to put all the electronics in it .
10999	0	a	I think it is a very
11000	0	a	Sorry ?
11001	0	a	Yeah ?
11002	0	a	Okay .
11003	1	a	If we make it s smaller , less wide , then we need to m make it a little thicker ,
11004	0	a	because I have to put all the electronics in it .
11005	0	a	Yeah ,
11006	1	a	but you have to j just keep in mind it should not be too heavy .
11007	1	a	I mean we can stick it in in there , I think .
11008	0	a	No .
11009	0	a	Huh
11010	0	a	even if in the worst case we can even
11011	1	a	Could you give me the pen back ?
11012	0	a	So
11013	0	a	let is say that people would want an LCD thing .
11014	0	a	So
11015	0	a	what kind of
11016	0	a	Yeah , sure .
11017	1	a	Let is take take the basic design again , what we oh , crap came up with .
11018	1	a	I will just make it a little bigger now .
11019	0	a	So
11020	1	a	a transmitter here .
11021	0	a	Anyway .
11022	0	a	We could
11023	0	a	let is say we have an LCD screen , people want an LCD screen .
11024	1	a	So then we should probably put it here .
11025	1	a	It does not have to be really big , but just just have to be has to be there .
11026	0	a	Think it is a good place ,
11027	0	a	people do not
11028	0	a	No ?
11029	0	a	It is not that it is not the most important function , it is just an extra thing ,
11030	0	a	it just
11031	0	a	you press the buttons on top , because your finger is on top .
11032	0	a	If you are reading from top to bottom , I think it is better to put it at the top .
11033	0	a	Me too .
11034	0	a	It is j
11035	0	a	but .
11036	0	a	But i if you if you are going to put the LCD on it , I think it is very important to use it ,
11037	0	a	because it is use it But nee the function of it .
11038	0	a	How can you use an LCD screen ?
11039	0	a	Yeah ,
11040	0	a	but why
11041	0	a	I I am not sure .
11042	0	a	So you can use it maximum , because it is a lot it costs a lot .
11043	0	a	So
11044	0	a	Yeah .
11045	0	a	Now it is pretty much tucked away in your hand .
11046	0	a	if you t if you press a button , you can see it ,
11047	0	a	ri I am not sure wha
11048	0	a	I am trying to imagine myself what it would look like .
11049	0	a	No .
11050	0	a	M
11051	0	a	I personally would prefer it on the top .
11052	0	a	I am
11053	0	a	I am still not convinced of the
11054	0	a	Yeah .
11055	0	a	You would prefer it
11056	0	a	n
11057	0	a	Okay .
11058	0	a	Huh .
11059	0	a	So we have three people saying it should be on top .
11060	0	a	Okay ,
11061	0	a	but then you would would s have to stack away your buttons somewhere else .
11062	0	a	But it
11063	0	a	Anyways .
11064	0	a	It is expensive to build it ,
11065	0	a	so
11066	1	a	you must use the maximum of it .
11067	0	a	this looks a little
11068	0	a	About the LCDs thing .
11069	0	a	Well if it if it is
11070	1	a	if it is possible wi if it is not too expensive , we should include it ,
11071	0	a	because it is it is cool .
11072	0	a	They want it .
11073	0	a	We should just try to make that if it is possible .
11074	0	a	If it is possible we should really do it ,
11075	0	a	but we need that information .
11076	0	a	Huh .
11077	0	a	Also keep in mind again , the LCD screen is very flat , but it needs transistors , resistors , I do not know what more and that needs space .
11078	0	a	But
11079	0	a	Yeah , I know .
11080	1	a	So I have to look if that is possible .
11081	0	a	But if we
11082	0	a	So basically
11083	0	a	can I
11084	1	a	what we have to decide now is what goes on top .
11085	0	a	we have green now
11086	1	a	Or maybe we should m we could draw draw something a bit that has it on on on the bottom .
11087	0	a	Do we put the volume control and the channel control here ,
11088	0	a	or do we put it on he
11089	0	a	Would we like to press it in the middle ?
11090	0	a	Yes ,
11091	0	a	but we do agree that we keep this at the centre ,
11092	0	a	because it is basically the most important function .
11093	1	a	In middle of it .
11094	0	a	In the middle .
11095	1	a	Maybe in a circle for example , like we like in this example .
11096	0	a	I think this is not good ,
11097	0	a	but for
11098	1	a	we could make circular buttons for example .
11099	1	a	For up and down , ma make it a circle on it ,
11100	0	a	because it
11101	0	a	I think the channel button should be in the centre .
11102	0	a	Yeah .
11103	0	a	It is the most import
11104	0	a	yeah .
11105	1	a	Channel button should be st stick together , for example here in this section .
11106	0	a	Because it is
11107	0	a	We are not sure about the size anyway ,
11108	0	a	just a general design .
11109	0	a	Well ,
11110	0	a	that would make them quite small .
11111	1	a	So maybe you would put them here .
11112	0	a	You can make it as big as you want .
11113	0	a	For example if you take
11114	0	a	No ,
11115	0	a	let is see .
11116	0	a	Yes , but a big remote control probably not something which people would like .
11117	0	a	For example just
11118	0	a	Yeah .
11119	1	a	If we have a a space issue , we can also lose one battery .
11120	0	a	It is rechargeable ,
11121	1	a	so we can stick with one instead of two .
11122	0	a	That might be an option .
11123	0	a	I do not think if we if we even use an LCD screen , we need to , definitely .
11124	0	a	Yeah ,
11125	0	a	but if we need two batteries and an LCD screen , that means a lot of space that we need .
11126	0	a	Yeah ,
11127	0	a	but we have to see what the si what the size is .
11128	0	a	But it has to be a little bit heavier .
11129	0	a	Okay .
11130	1	a	The LCD does not have to nee does not need to be very big .
11131	0	a	No ,
11132	0	a	but the things behind it .
11133	0	a	space .
11134	0	a	let is see .
11135	0	a	Like a process .
11136	0	a	Finish meeting now .
11137	0	a	It is on your computer .
11138	0	a	Finish meeting now .
11139	0	a	Okay , we will .
11140	0	a	So
11141	0	a	would we like this
11142	0	a	or would we like the
11143	1	a	Let is see what we have here .
11144	0	a	So either
11145	0	a	We either we have to decide what what people want .
11146	0	a	I like this one more .
11147	0	a	Either this one ,
11148	0	a	this this could be the luxurious one .
11149	0	a	So we have channel buttons here .
11150	0	a	I am just drawing something .
11151	0	a	I think this would this would look cool .
11152	1	a	You could have it for example small buttons here for some extra functions ,
11153	0	a	so if your basic function is here , we should like we decided before , programmes up and down , and volume here .
11154	0	a	Or
11155	0	a	And what about speech recognition
11156	0	a	Yeah , yeah ,
11157	0	a	but or
11158	1	a	or an LCD or an speech .
11159	0	a	Well
11160	0	a	you can just
11161	0	a	no , I am not sure if we can do that ,
11162	1	a	but we could put a microphone in here for example .
11163	0	a	I think it is LCD is better now .
11164	1	a	Just to do research into both , w what it costs and what it takes for space .
11165	0	a	Yeah .
11166	0	a	I will try to .
11167	0	a	Yeah .
11168	1	a	But let is cut the meeting for now yes .
11169	1	a	One more thing I would like to say ,
11170	1	a	let is give this a name , and not like some vague serial number that no one understands , like with cars .
11171	0	a	Okay .
11172	0	a	Yeah , okay ,
11173	0	a	yeah ,
11174	0	a	that is
11175	0	a	yeah , that is okay .
11176	0	a	Shall we all try to think about a name ?
11177	0	a	Good luck .
11178	0	a	So I think of a name .
11179	0	a	Yeah , let is think of a name , okay .
11180	0	a	okay .
11181	0	a	Oh , good .
11182	0	a	Okay , at anyways ,
11183	1	a	the the minutes will be on the on the web shortly ,
11184	0	a	so there we go .
11185	0	a	So
11186	0	a	Yes ,
11187	1	a	go and finish up
11188	1	a	and I will see you at lunch .
11189	0	a	Yeah .
11190	0	a	Same .
11191	0	a	Yeah , I have
11192	0	a	 
11193	0	a	Did you manage ?
11194	0	a	Okay .
11195	0	a	Yeah , sh not quite .
11196	0	a	You will see
11197	0	a	Woah .
11198	0	a	Hello .
11199	0	a	Hello .
11200	0	a	So ,
11201	0	a	are you d
11202	0	a	what were j you guys discussing ?
11203	0	a	Okay .
11204	0	a	No ,
11205	0	a	just ask if if he could manage .
11206	0	a	Yeah .
11207	0	a	Did you find anything new ?
11208	0	a	nothing special .
11209	0	a	Yeah , the for the trendy stuff .
11210	0	a	I have a lot of new information .
11211	0	a	Great , great .
11212	0	a	A little bit .
11213	0	a	Come on .
11214	1	a	I now will show it .
11215	0	a	Hey ,
11216	0	a	everything alright .
11217	0	a	Well ,
11218	0	a	I had just a little bit of time , so I hope it is something we can work with .
11219	0	a	Did you manage ?
11220	0	a	Okay .
11221	0	a	Okay .
11222	0	a	What is here .
11223	0	a	But
11224	0	a	Well ,
11225	0	a	I heard that there was a new component speech recognition component , which was pretty much up to standard ,
11226	1	a	so we might use that
11227	0	a	I put that in my drawing , but again I did not not have that much time .
11228	0	a	Yeah ,
11229	0	a	I had the same .
11230	0	a	It just shuts itself down
11231	0	a	and
11232	0	a	Oh .
11233	0	a	Do you have a lot of new information ?
11234	0	a	Do you have a lot of new information ?
11235	0	a	That is true .
11236	0	a	And there we are .
11237	0	a	Huh .
11238	0	a	So
11239	0	a	Okay ,
11240	0	a	that is just super .
11241	0	a	Alright .
11242	0	a	I have a lot of new information .
11243	0	a	What the f
11244	0	a	oh , yeah .
11245	0	a	I have a complete list of everything that we can use , all the components that all av available .
11246	0	a	It does not do what I want it
11247	0	a	Okay fine ,
11248	0	a	that is too bad .
11249	0	a	I have no
11250	0	a	I still do not have any finance information , but at least we have a lot more to go on now
11251	0	a	Yep , that is right .
11252	0	a	Let me just
11253	0	a	You need to start it up first ?
11254	0	a	Okay .
11255	0	a	Yeah , I have to start our
11256	0	a	Kay .
11257	0	a	Okay ,
11258	1	a	go again .
11259	0	a	Well
11260	0	a	second phase , conceptual design .
11261	0	a	It is fine , everybody knows what we are talking about .
11262	0	a	So ,
11263	1	a	take you past the minutes of last meeting again .
11264	0	a	Yep .
11265	0	a	Again you get your three presentate to see what you came up with .
11266	0	a	So
11267	0	a	too bad we do not have any finance information apparently .
11268	0	a	So that is too bad .
11269	1	a	So then we will just have to d have to go on , you know , the information that we have to make the make final decisions on on a conceptual design .
11270	0	a	So Here we go .
11271	0	a	Anyway ,
11272	0	a	last w last w
11273	0	a	what discussed last time , you all remember that , that we have to keep the electronics size in mind .
11274	0	a	Same goes for you .
11275	0	a	We have to have an easy design with big buttons which are durable and there are people actually spen willing to spend money to do to get more features and among those features LCD screen and voice recognition are very popular .
11276	1	a	So we have to make a move on that area , I guess .
11277	0	a	S
11278	0	a	especially s when when the new component is applicable in our product , we will be fine .
11279	0	a	Anyways , well
11280	0	a	teletext was not important and that is what I took .
11281	0	a	And the consumer ,
11282	0	a	yeah ,
11283	0	a	we aim for young consumers ,
11284	0	a	so that is fine .
11285	0	a	And well actually we
11286	0	a	yeah ,
11287	0	a	we did need some more data on finances , but w
11288	0	a	yeah
11289	0	a	we still do not have that apparently .
11290	0	a	uh huh .
11291	0	a	That is too bad .
11292	0	a	Yeah ,
11293	0	a	we need to im de
11294	0	a	we are going to implement the beep and the flash thing to recover your remote .
11295	0	a	So
11296	0	a	one of these interchangeable covers apparently which will make it a more fashionable product .
11297	0	a	So anyway .
11298	1	a	Guess we will have to do this after the after the you give your presentations .
11299	0	a	So
11300	1	a	I will just close this one now ,
11301	0	a	and let is let is see , .
11302	0	a	Okay ,
11303	0	a	what t
11304	0	a	Okay , yeah .
11305	0	a	I bet
11306	0	a	Oh okay .
11307	0	a	We have a lot to tell .
11308	0	a	You had a lot to go on .
11309	0	a	So
11310	1	a	how about you go first .
11311	1	a	Let is see where my presentation is .
11312	0	a	Okay ,
11313	0	a	this I mentioned before .
11314	0	a	Every feature for our remote control needs to have their own operating electronic devices .
11315	0	a	We need to take care of that .
11316	0	a	Then warning , there has to be a chip in our remote control .
11317	0	a	And the chip requirements needed for a normal button is just a simple chip , scroll wheel , and LCD is an advanced .
11318	0	a	Of course this is more expensive than this .
11319	1	a	So we have to decide on that in a minute .
11320	0	a	Okay .
11321	0	a	The available components for energy are , we have a basic battery , a hand an dynamo , like in old torches .
11322	0	a	We have a kin kinetic provision , then you have to shake the remote control to get the energy .
11323	0	a	And we have solar cells .
11324	1	a	I suggest that we decide on that one immediately .
11325	0	a	Then I have all lists .
11326	0	a	So
11327	1	a	My personal fav favourite is the kinetic provision
11328	0	a	because I ha
11329	0	a	I think so , yes .
11330	0	a	Yeah .
11331	0	a	Does it provide enough energy ?
11332	0	a	Also if if we were choose the the LCD option , would it give enough energy
11333	0	a	Okay ,
11334	0	a	that is the just assume it takes .
11335	0	a	Yes .
11336	0	a	Yes .
11337	0	a	Because I had the information you take the remote control , you pick it up at least two times a day .
11338	0	a	So then it is already shaken and gives energy .
11339	0	a	Well ,
11340	0	a	I am not sure if it is shaken enough ,
11341	0	a	because
11342	0	a	No , I do not think so ,
11343	0	a	because watches can go on kinetic energy because they move all the time .
11344	0	a	Is that enough ?
11345	0	a	Because I do not really see people shaking their remote control before using it .
11346	0	a	Or Think
11347	0	a	But I am sure t
11348	0	a	I mean remotes lie
11349	0	a	still I think like ninety nine percent of the time .
11350	0	a	So I do not think that is
11351	0	a	a really good
11352	0	a	the other alternative were solar cells .
11353	0	a	I do not think that is applicable
11354	0	a	because I thin why
11355	0	a	why should not we take a basic battery ?
11356	0	a	Why not ?
11357	0	a	I mean everybody everybody knows how to use that .
11358	0	a	Other options are solar cells , hand dynamo and basic battery .
11359	0	a	No .
11360	0	a	And what does the hand dynamo
11361	0	a	oh , sorry .
11362	1	a	A rechargeable maybe .
11363	0	a	Only basic battery ?
11364	0	a	Okay ,
11365	0	a	but I think this is not a r .
11366	0	a	Re rechargeable basi
11367	0	a	Yeah .
11368	0	a	It is it is common .
11369	0	a	So
11370	0	a	and it is available everywhere .
11371	0	a	Yeah .
11372	0	a	So why sh I think better .
11373	0	a	Yeah ,
11374	0	a	but I think this rules out our unit our rechargeable unit .
11375	0	a	This is really a really basic battery , a normal battery .
11376	0	a	Yeah ,
11377	0	a	but it is
11378	0	a	Yeah ,
11379	0	a	it was not it was not in the options , a rechargeable m module actually .
11380	0	a	Oh .
11381	0	a	Huh ?
11382	0	a	Okay ,
11383	0	a	that is .
11384	0	a	Okay ?
11385	0	a	Okay ,
11386	0	a	but then we do not offer a re chargement function .
11387	0	a	Okay yeah ,
11388	0	a	b you c
11389	0	a	of course you could place re re chargeable batteries .
11390	0	a	Yep .
11391	0	a	Basic .
11392	0	a	But that is up to the consumer himself .
11393	0	a	So
11394	0	a	Well ,
11395	0	a	it is not in the list .
11396	0	a	That is what it says .
11397	0	a	So we cannot choose from it .
11398	0	a	So
11399	0	a	Okay , will just take regular batteries .
11400	0	a	Exactly .
11401	0	a	Alright .
11402	0	a	Right .
11403	0	a	Yep .
11404	0	a	Okay .
11405	0	a	Next one is curving .
11406	0	a	we can make a model that has one curve , two or three .
11407	0	a	And
11408	0	a	th the shape .
11409	0	a	Curves being ?
11410	0	a	Of the remote control itself ,
11411	0	a	okay .
11412	0	a	Of course the more curves the more expensive .
11413	0	a	Okay .
11414	0	a	Exactly .
11415	0	a	But But It dep
11416	0	a	But
11417	0	a	Yeah .
11418	0	a	Yes .
11419	1	a	I was thinking along the line of one curve .
11420	1	a	I will show that in my design .
11421	0	a	Okay , we will get back on that later .
11422	0	a	So
11423	0	a	we will get back to that .
11424	0	a	Just
11425	0	a	But what were the implications if you if put more curves it
11426	0	a	it is gets more expensive .
11427	0	a	I think one curve is fine .
11428	0	a	Yeah .
11429	0	a	Depends on the user .
11430	0	a	More expensive .
11431	0	a	Okay ,
11432	0	a	so I think with with the extras that we had there
11433	0	a	it is two curves I suppose .
11434	0	a	More difficult to make .
11435	0	a	Exactly .
11436	0	a	Okay .
11437	0	a	And I believe even that the r the number of options we have on putting things in it goes down with
11438	0	a	exactly .
11439	0	a	Also decreases , okay .
11440	0	a	Material .
11441	0	a	I have to offer a plastic , rubber , wood or titanium .
11442	0	a	if we choose plastic , we cannot choose solar cells for energy .
11443	0	a	If we choose titanium , we cannot use more than one curve .
11444	0	a	Okay .
11445	0	a	But we do not have that so fast .
11446	0	a	More than one curve , yeah
11447	0	a	okay .
11448	0	a	Okay ,
11449	0	a	I t
11450	1	a	I would go for plastic
11451	0	a	because I have a couple of curves in my design .
11452	0	a	We will just go Cause it
11453	0	a	yeah ,
11454	0	a	I am not sure .
11455	0	a	Yeah .
11456	0	a	Well ,
11457	0	a	g
11458	1	a	let is just get back to that .
11459	1	a	We will discuss that later .
11460	0	a	Okay ,
11461	0	a	we have
11462	0	a	so I think we can rule out
11463	1	a	I am not sure we can rule anything out .
11464	0	a	Yeah .
11465	0	a	Okay .
11466	1	a	We will do that when y when you get your design .
11467	0	a	No .
11468	1	a	But I think wood is not an option either .
11469	0	a	No , wood is not an option .
11470	0	a	No , wood i wood is not an option .
11471	0	a	No .
11472	0	a	Well
11473	0	a	it it is stylish ,
11474	0	a	but we can
11475	0	a	yeah ,
11476	0	a	but you can change your covers anyway .
11477	0	a	Okay .
11478	0	a	No .
11479	0	a	Okay .
11480	1	a	My personal thought was rubber
11481	0	a	because I had an email , I believe it was from you , f against falling .
11482	0	a	Yeah ,
11483	0	a	is it keep in mind that it it is it is it fal
11484	0	a	remote controls fall a lot on the ground .
11485	0	a	So you do not want it to break .
11486	1	a	So either have rubber edges or a rubber remote control is very durable .
11487	0	a	Okay .
11488	0	a	But
11489	1	a	Continue .
11490	0	a	Yeah ,
11491	1	a	but it does not have to be unbreakable ,
11492	0	a	because we do need to keep selling these thing
11493	0	a	Okay , well
11494	0	a	that that is definitely true .
11495	0	a	No .
11496	0	a	Do not have to be un breakable ,
11497	0	a	it is p it is a
11498	0	a	it is not supposed to ju
11499	0	a	yeah
11500	0	a	, break after one use .
11501	0	a	Yeah .
11502	0	a	I mean it they
11503	0	a	they fall a lot .
11504	0	a	So
11505	0	a	Well ,
11506	0	a	you have for if you if
11507	0	a	for example if you take hard plastic .
11508	1	a	I think we have to decide on this anyway .
11509	0	a	because if we make removeable covers , it has to be one of those mat materials .
11510	0	a	We have no more than this .
11511	0	a	So
11512	0	a	Because it
11513	0	a	well ,
11514	0	a	ru
11515	0	a	will rubber actually protect the remote control itself ?
11516	0	a	Because it
11517	0	a	Yeah ,
11518	0	a	but then you buy a new cover .
11519	0	a	If it falls it might crack .
11520	0	a	And rubber kind of softens the fall .
11521	0	a	But rubber
11522	0	a	Okay .
11523	0	a	I am not sure if it is the it is the entire cover you change .
11524	0	a	, it is could be .
11525	0	a	Are are we focussi focussing on on the But
11526	0	a	But Not that
11527	0	a	but are we focussing on the younger people or the elder people ?
11528	0	a	Younger , okay .
11529	0	a	You know what ,
11530	0	a	th
11531	0	a	we are focusing very much on the covers now .
11532	0	a	I think it is just w now
11533	0	a	we are going for the basic design .
11534	1	a	If we want to expand our options , f be fashionable , then we can get changeable covers .
11535	0	a	But I think the basic thing
11536	1	a	let is just rule out wood for now and continue .
11537	0	a	Okay .
11538	0	a	We are definitely focussing on the younger people , cause that was our main goal .
11539	0	a	Yeah , that is okay .
11540	0	a	Nah , that is
11541	0	a	But But th the younger people
11542	0	a	my investigation turns out that the younger people want a little bit material that that is spongy
11543	0	a	and So A
11544	0	a	sc
11545	0	a	Yeah .
11546	0	a	Alright .
11547	1	a	Then I proceed ,
11548	0	a	but I need to know after this meeting .
11549	0	a	So
11550	0	a	Interface , I have four things to offer ,
11551	0	a	pu
11552	0	a	normal push buttons of course .
11553	0	a	Okay okay , we will .
11554	0	a	we have a lot of expertise on that one .
11555	0	a	We have a large history , our company , on push buttons .
11556	0	a	Scroll wheels , those can be pushed as well , although that is more expensive .
11557	0	a	liquid crystal colour display
11558	0	a	and
11559	0	a	What is this ?
11560	0	a	Okay ,
11561	0	a	and if we use rubber , I already mentioned that , we can only use rubber buttons .
11562	0	a	So rubber can only match with rubber .
11563	1	a	Which one of those are we going to use ?
11564	1	a	Evident .
11565	1	a	Yeah , o of course we are going to use .
11566	0	a	But I did not I did not go on the thought of a scroll wheel actually .
11567	0	a	Yeah ,
11568	0	a	of cour
11569	0	a	Yeah ,
11570	0	a	but there is a
11571	0	a	is it really necessary
11572	0	a	cause a normal push button can do that job .
11573	0	a	Huh .
11574	1	a	I am still deciding on what what what could you use it for .
11575	0	a	No .
11576	1	a	Maybe for volume control .
11577	1	a	I think the channels .
11578	0	a	Channel , I think that would be annoying
11579	0	a	because it might accidentally scroll onto another channel .
11580	0	a	Oh .
11581	0	a	Yeah .
11582	1	a	I think a push button for channel would be better .
11583	0	a	I mean it
11584	0	a	for volume control it is it is a smoother motion ,
11585	0	a	you can just increase or decrease .
11586	0	a	Huh ?
11587	0	a	Huh .
11588	0	a	But not sure .
11589	0	a	For channels will be good .
11590	0	a	But
11591	0	a	Huh ?
11592	0	a	Oh .
11593	0	a	I do not think so .
11594	0	a	I have not I have not taken it into consideration .
11595	0	a	so
11596	0	a	but it looks cool .
11597	0	a	I do not think we really need one .
11598	0	a	no .
11599	0	a	Oh .
11600	0	a	flashy and
11601	0	a	yeah .
11602	0	a	I think would be cool , scroll wheel .
11603	0	a	It is not that much
11604	0	a	if we take a normal scroll wheel without the pushing , then it is not expensive .
11605	1	a	We can do that .
11606	0	a	But why do we need it ?
11607	0	a	If we do not need it , why put it in your why put it in your in your if it is if it is not something people are looking for or is useful .
11608	0	a	Yeah ,
11609	0	a	but why would we use it ?
11610	0	a	Perhaps .
11611	1	a	Think .
11612	0	a	we do not need it , but it is it is design a design thing .
11613	0	a	Yeah ,
11614	0	a	you get
11615	0	a	No .
11616	0	a	I think they are looking for that .
11617	0	a	Of course we have a young target group .
11618	0	a	Are they ?
11619	0	a	Yeah ,
11620	0	a	but if it is if it is not useful ,
11621	0	a	I do not think it I do not think it gives an extra function to the remote .
11622	0	a	So they might find that attractive in a remote con
11623	0	a	Okay .
11624	0	a	Scroll wheel ?
11625	0	a	I do not know .
11626	0	a	Yeah , that is it .
11627	0	a	Anyway
11628	0	a	What you
11629	0	a	what
11630	0	a	what would you get on the LCD screen ?
11631	0	a	Is it expensive ?
11632	0	a	Does it
11633	0	a	And how much more expensive is that ?
11634	0	a	Or
11635	0	a	No absolute numbers ,
11636	0	a	but it is just more expensive and takes more room
11637	0	a	I suppose in your in your design .
11638	0	a	So push buttons we will use .
11639	0	a	LCD screen ?
11640	0	a	Is that s
11641	0	a	I only know that if we are using that , we need ano an advanced chip in it .
11642	0	a	I have t
11643	0	a	I have two different
11644	0	a	Okay .
11645	0	a	Yeah .
11646	0	a	And that is more expensive .
11647	0	a	I have no idea .
11648	0	a	I have no absolute numbers .
11649	0	a	I only have
11650	0	a	Yeah ,
11651	0	a	but I do not think room is really an issue .
11652	0	a	Do not think it is an issue , okay .
11653	0	a	Oh let is go for
11654	0	a	let is say because it is very hot in n our target group I think ,
11655	1	a	we should take it take it t to consideration to build an LCD screen in it .
11656	0	a	I have two designs , one including an LCD screen , wh which is basically the deluxe edition .
11657	0	a	For the future .
11658	0	a	Okay .
11659	0	a	Yeah .
11660	0	a	And then I also have a standard edition , which wi we can also choose to develop too .
11661	0	a	Which basically has the same functionality , but lacks the LCD screen .
11662	0	a	Yep
11663	0	a	Yep .
11664	0	a	Exactly .
11665	0	a	Okay .
11666	0	a	But we will
11667	0	a	Yep .
11668	0	a	We will pick a we will pick from
11669	1	a	we will just combine everything later .
11670	0	a	Okay .
11671	0	a	Electronics , the first one is the chip .
11672	0	a	that is no longer an option , it has to be an advanced one now .
11673	0	a	Cause we have the LCD screen .
11674	0	a	Then we have an infrared sender , I think that is basic , we cannot do without .
11675	0	a	Basically ,
11676	0	a	it
11677	0	a	Oh ,
11678	0	a	I got
11679	0	a	I got an email that it is relatively small .
11680	0	a	Otherwise it is not s a remote control .
11681	0	a	And we have the sample sensor and speaker , the voice recognition thing .
11682	0	a	Are we going to do that or not ?
11683	0	a	I only have relative information .
11684	0	a	Once again I was would ask you if it is expensive , but apparently you do not have any data .
11685	0	a	So Well
11686	0	a	what d what was exact what you got on the on the new component ?
11687	0	a	That is small .
11688	0	a	So we can implement it .
11689	0	a	Yes ,
11690	1	a	let me just Get back .
11691	0	a	So why why
11692	1	a	if it is small and we can imp why should not we ?
11693	0	a	And there is get your mar marketing report ?
11694	0	a	What was the last number of how many people were interested in voice recognition ?
11695	0	a	Although it is hard for different countries of course .
11696	0	a	Oh
11697	0	a	how did you
11698	0	a	That goes also for the scroll wheel , by the way .
11699	0	a	The most of them more than sixty percent .
11700	0	a	But you have to programme it yourself , I suppose , with your own voice .
11701	0	a	More than sixty percent of the people would like voice recognition .
11702	0	a	Yeah .
11703	0	a	Mean of seventy percent I think .
11704	0	a	I am
11705	1	a	I have to look it up .
11706	1	a	If it is small , if it is fits , if if people like it , why not ?
11707	0	a	So
11708	0	a	Yeah ,
11709	0	a	but we got some data on people that actually are int are interested in that , and I do not think a scroll wheel offers new functionality , whereas speech recognition and LCD screen do offer new functionality in your product .
11710	0	a	Yeah .
11711	0	a	But do not we have any w information about scroll wheel ?
11712	0	a	Scroll wheel .
11713	0	a	If people would like that .
11714	0	a	No .
11715	0	a	No ,
11716	0	a	only
11717	0	a	That is strange ,
11718	0	a	because that is the same story .
11719	0	a	It is it is not necessary like an LCD , but it is just it adds something to the design .
11720	0	a	I do not know .
11721	0	a	On the most spee
11722	0	a	But
11723	0	a	Yeah ,
11724	0	a	for the future .
11725	0	a	No
11726	0	a	Oh that is r
11727	0	a	But I think we now already have to implement an advanced chip .
11728	0	a	I think so ,
11729	0	a	because if I think we are specially w if you are going
11730	1	a	maybe if you have the two editions you want to want to give out , probably you have one with with speech recognition
11731	0	a	and
11732	0	a	Yeah ,
11733	1	a	hold on a minute .
11734	0	a	So it is m
11735	0	a	No ,
11736	0	a	but that is that is okay .
11737	0	a	Well ,
11738	0	a	they b
11739	0	a	they basically can have speech recognition .
11740	0	a	I mainly focused on the LCD aspect .
11741	0	a	Were were you
11742	0	a	we are finished ?
11743	0	a	Or
11744	0	a	Oh .
11745	0	a	Because if there is something that Cause have
11746	0	a	did you have all the materials ?
11747	0	a	Or everything that you desc
11748	0	a	Okay , so
11749	1	a	just just go for design for now .
11750	0	a	Cause you wanted to see them ,
11751	0	a	right ?
11752	1	a	So this is basically the deluxe edition .
11753	0	a	There is still time .
11754	0	a	Yes , this was the last MS .
11755	0	a	I have a clear picture .
11756	1	a	Just m have a seat for a second .
11757	1	a	We will combine everything after this .
11758	0	a	Why is it s why is it squared ?
11759	0	a	Why did you pick square ?
11760	0	a	Or not square , but why is it yeah , sharp corners .
11761	0	a	I j
11762	0	a	Why is it square ?
11763	0	a	It
11764	0	a	cause it is designy .
11765	0	a	It is basically it has some futuristic Potentially ,
11766	0	a	yeah .
11767	0	a	Yeah .
11768	0	a	I do not really know .
11769	0	a	But I just thought that in normal remote controls you have like smooth curves and this and that , and this is something new , this is something different , something fresh .
11770	0	a	People Ri
11771	0	a	So only r right handed .
11772	0	a	Looks like a Star Trek phaser .
11773	0	a	It is true .
11774	1	a	And basically what you can see here is that it has a little ,
11775	1	a	yeah ,
11776	1	a	let is say gap
11777	0	a	which you can put your finger in .
11778	0	a	Yeah .
11779	0	a	Or Okay , so
11780	0	a	just yeah ,
11781	0	a	you can rest it on your finger .
11782	0	a	So you can you can hold it really comfortable , that is basically the idea .
11783	0	a	Okay .
11784	0	a	But it but it is only right handed then .
11785	0	a	Not for the left .
11786	0	a	Or left hand .
11787	0	a	No ,
11788	0	a	it just
11789	0	a	it is a curve inside a thing .
11790	0	a	Or
11791	0	a	Where ?
11792	0	a	Wher
11793	0	a	Oh in the back , okay .
11794	0	a	I
11795	0	a	does not really matter .
11796	0	a	So
11797	0	a	It is on the back .
11798	0	a	As you can see , this is the remote control you ca not really see it that well , but this is the LCD screen .
11799	0	a	Oh yeah
11800	0	a	yeah .
11801	0	a	Okay .
11802	0	a	So just imagine it goes that way .
11803	0	a	Yeah , I think it is okay .
11804	0	a	Oh yeah
11805	0	a	yeah .
11806	0	a	Then you can see you can hold it in your left or in your right hand .
11807	0	a	Okay .
11808	0	a	Yeah .
11809	0	a	Yeah yeah .
11810	0	a	And I also made a quick image , cause I did not have that much time , of the standard edition
11811	1	a	which has basically the keys are pretty much the same .
11812	0	a	Yeah .
11813	0	a	I thought it
11814	0	a	Well
11815	0	a	it it is
11816	0	a	yeah .
11817	0	a	Keys are probably the n the number keys , I suppose .
11818	0	a	Yeah .
11819	0	a	I had to do this really fast .
11820	0	a	So excuse me for the inconvenience here ,
11821	0	a	but as you can see , the keys moved .
11822	0	a	Okay .
11823	0	a	Well ,
11824	1	a	you can work on the actual concept or actual design later with him .
11825	0	a	Yeah .
11826	0	a	So
11827	0	a	these are basically the two types we have .
11828	0	a	But
11829	0	a	Well ,
11830	0	a	I think what you have to keep in mind is that you are moving the the the number keys from the top .
11831	0	a	So if we were to select the LCD screen , the transmitter here , you can see the light
11832	0	a	i
11833	0	a	Well
11834	1	a	we can shift that .
11835	0	a	in the the simple design you have them at a top , and the complex design you have them at the bottom .
11836	0	a	So it would that would give us a totally different design .
11837	0	a	So which actually making a whole different product instead of two different models .
11838	0	a	I think it would be very expensive to produce two whole different products .
11839	0	a	So
11840	0	a	Yeah ,
11841	0	a	or for example , why did you pick the the numbers all the way below , and the and the channels and volume control
11842	0	a	Okay .
11843	0	a	But normally , as you can see there , we put the number buttons right on top .
11844	0	a	Whereas because we had the LCD screen here , we had to move them downward ,
11845	0	a	so what you could say is that
11846	0	a	Because these are basically the functions you use the most .
11847	0	a	So if you hold it in your hand like this , you put your finger in the gap ,
11848	0	a	this is the m most easy part .
11849	0	a	Bit .
11850	0	a	, I agree .
11851	0	a	For zapping ,
11852	0	a	cau
11853	0	a	because people are zapping most of the time .
11854	0	a	That is fine .
11855	0	a	Yeah .
11856	0	a	That is fine .
11857	0	a	Just as long as you tak took it into consideration what people would prefer .
11858	0	a	, okay
11859	0	a	if you all agree , I am fine with it .
11860	0	a	But
11861	0	a	Okay .
11862	0	a	Yeah .
11863	0	a	Okay .
11864	0	a	So
11865	0	a	that is pretty much ha which I had in mind .
11866	1	a	As you can see here , this can be spaced for extra keys ,
11867	0	a	which is the design thingys .
11868	0	a	No
11869	0	a	it
11870	1	a	maybe it is better to look what the people want .
11871	0	a	Yeah ,
11872	0	a	I think we will
11873	0	a	I think we are going towards the deluxe edition anyway ,
11874	0	a	because that seems to be what the people want .
11875	1	a	So I can show my investigation .
11876	0	a	Yeah , maybe it is better .
11877	1	a	But let is see what is what they want now .
11878	0	a	Yeah .
11879	0	a	Especially for young people .
11880	0	a	where is that ?
11881	0	a	Where is th
11882	0	a	Oh .
11883	0	a	That is mine .
11884	0	a	Yeah .
11885	0	a	No ,
11886	1	a	you should send it to the f to the folder first .
11887	0	a	I forgot that .
11888	0	a	Okay ,
11889	0	a	let is just assume we go to forty one .
11890	0	a	Okay ,
11891	0	a	now it must be there .
11892	0	a	Yeah , here it is .
11893	0	a	Oh yeah .
11894	0	a	Okay ,
11895	0	a	the investigation turns out that the most appear people want look and feel likes is the s the same as before , but it must be w a little bit fancier than the the look of it .
11896	0	a	the second important thing is the it must be technol technological innova vative .
11897	0	a	So that is the LCD screen is perfect , I think ,
11898	0	a	and not
11899	0	a	Yeah , tha that is very important .
11900	0	a	Speech recognition .
11901	0	a	And a third thing is
11902	0	a	yeah
11903	0	a	, it is should be easy to use ,
11904	1	a	so not not too much bu buttons and channel selection .
11905	0	a	I think that is what you showed is perfect .
11906	0	a	And what the pe young people want is in Paris and and in Milan it showed out that the fruit and vegetables are are trendy .
11907	0	a	Th they
11908	0	a	you s you see it in the clothes and everything .
11909	1	a	And the contrast of it , it must the the buttons must a little bit spongy material .
11910	0	a	So rubber , I think th that is the best .
11911	0	a	No .
11912	0	a	Then rubber would be the best as a material indeed .
11913	0	a	Yeah , I agree .
11914	0	a	No .
11915	0	a	I think so .
11916	0	a	So we are we were focussing on the younger people .
11917	0	a	If that is the
11918	1	a	It could be a c it could be a cover .
11919	0	a	Okay , agreement .
11920	0	a	Okay .
11921	0	a	So the elder , yeah , they wanted a little bit of wood in it
11922	0	a	and that is th that is not important now .
11923	0	a	Okay ,
11924	0	a	so we are definitely going for rubber .
11925	0	a	Yeah .
11926	0	a	But it is not .
11927	0	a	Yeah ,
11928	0	a	but
11929	0	a	Yeah .
11930	0	a	Our focus is the young audience .
11931	0	a	Let is just go
11932	0	a	Uh huh .
11933	0	a	So let is stick to that .
11934	0	a	Cause n I
11935	0	a	I
11936	0	a	I
11937	0	a	I thought it makes a young classic remote with
11938	0	a	Yeah ,
11939	0	a	that is why I I d decided With a fruit cover ov or something like that .
11940	0	a	Nah ,
11941	0	a	I think we are in this case you are losing the the focus on the young group , because we are that is what we are focussing on .
11942	1	a	So I think the spongy feel gives us rubber .
11943	0	a	Yeah ,
11944	0	a	apparently
11945	0	a	yeah ,
11946	0	a	maybe also
11947	0	a	yeah ,
11948	0	a	I tend to disagree with with with a sharp form .
11949	1	a	I suppose it basi if you are saying fruits and vegetables , maybe it is supposed to be a little little more round .
11950	0	a	Yeah ,
11951	1	a	in in form of an vegetable or an fruit , maybe .
11952	0	a	Yeah ,
11953	0	a	for exa
11954	1	a	maybe like like a pear or something .
11955	0	a	Yeah ,
11956	0	a	but that is just more a se a seasonal , a trend thing .
11957	0	a	And
11958	0	a	Oh ,
11959	0	a	where is your A trendy
11960	0	a	Here he here you can put a maybe it
11961	0	a	But
11962	0	a	Yeah .
11963	0	a	That is true .
11964	0	a	That is what we are doing .
11965	1	a	The idea now is is is that you can put a cover on it , for example , with fruit , like a shape or whatever .
11966	0	a	I think shape is is important ,
11967	0	a	because they s they really extend .
11968	0	a	But not
11969	0	a	cause a n next year it will it will be something completely different .
11970	0	a	Oh , that is true .
11971	0	a	And then you have your apple shaped remote control , which is not trendy anymore .
11972	1	a	So I think that is more something you can focus
11973	0	a	Well ,
11974	0	a	you can s
11975	1	a	What you can do is smooth the edges indeed .
11976	0	a	Yeah ,
11977	0	a	but now you have your your like your Star Trek phaser thing shaped control .
11978	0	a	So I I th
11979	0	a	the edges are really really sharp .
11980	0	a	I am not su
11981	1	a	Or maybe just make it make it up into into a low a smooth curve instead of just less sharp twist on the outside .
11982	0	a	But that will bring extra c expenses .
11983	1	a	All veg fruit and vegetables are round .
11984	0	a	So it is better
11985	0	a	Yeah .
11986	0	a	I think I think there needs to be a little
11987	0	a	I think it is too too sharp .
11988	0	a	The edges are too sharp .
11989	0	a	The bottom is fine of course if it is square .
11990	1	a	But maybe just th make the top a little round it off on the sides .
11991	0	a	So I mean y
11992	0	a	That would be two curves .
11993	0	a	But I think , according to my information , this would be two curves .
11994	0	a	Two ?
11995	0	a	But it But it is that
11996	0	a	that is for the comfort .
11997	0	a	We have one left and one right ,
11998	0	a	and that disables what was it again ?
11999	0	a	It is some it is something that we cannot do then .
12000	0	a	One cur
12001	1	a	you could also make the curve go through of course .
12002	0	a	But that would make make the top round .
12003	0	a	Well
12004	0	a	we have got we have got like one curve here .
12005	0	a	Okay ,
12006	0	a	that is not a problem .
12007	0	a	For the gap .
12008	0	a	That is only for the titanium .
12009	0	a	We do not have .
12010	1	a	And we could have one here .
12011	0	a	It is it is not for the trendy thing of it .
12012	0	a	No , no no no no .
12013	0	a	What I am just
12014	0	a	cause you mentioned that more curves the more expensive , so I am just taking that into account .
12015	0	a	Yeah ?
12016	0	a	Okay , yeah .
12017	0	a	Yes
12018	0	a	But let is see ,
12019	0	a	titanium would give us only one curve .
12020	0	a	Then w
12021	0	a	yeah ,
12022	0	a	but we do not have that .
12023	0	a	So
12024	0	a	but we are not d we are not using titanium .
12025	0	a	So we have We have no .
12026	0	a	So the no .
12027	0	a	Well
12028	0	a	we picked rubber ,
12029	0	a	right ?
12030	1	a	So basically what we can do is m make these edges a little bit less sharp .
12031	0	a	Right , we did .
12032	0	a	So
12033	1	a	Just doodle something on the board on the left .
12034	0	a	But they They th
12035	0	a	these wha are what they call the curves .
12036	0	a	We m form .
12037	0	a	But the problem then is that it will start to resemble m the remote controls as we have them today .
12038	0	a	We were looking at something fresh , something trendy
12039	0	a	Okay .
12040	0	a	Well actually ,
12041	0	a	we are setting ourselves apart from by technology alone actually .
12042	0	a	So that
12043	1	a	let is see what you are doing .
12044	0	a	This side , this side , this is how they count .
12045	0	a	Oh , okay .
12046	0	a	I do not think like that .
12047	0	a	Not not really the curves on the on the side of the remote .
12048	0	a	No no .
12049	0	a	This is what they what they mean .
12050	0	a	Okay ,
12051	0	a	so that is basically silly .
12052	0	a	Okay , that is not really a good .
12053	0	a	Okay ,
12054	0	a	now I of course now I understand why they have more like Why the curves decrease the the the size the electronics that can be inside .
12055	0	a	So Okay .
12056	0	a	I do not think the outside would be called as a curve really .
12057	0	a	Yeah .
12058	0	a	It is like this .
12059	0	a	I think it is for all the basic well , looking from the side anyway .
12060	0	a	Well ,
12061	0	a	if you see what
12062	0	a	I have to come up with some designs fast anyway .
12063	0	a	So
12064	0	a	Okay .
12065	0	a	But you can make if you want to use a fruit in in
12066	0	a	Hey , you
12067	1	a	You can make it like Like this .
12068	0	a	But is not the f the fruit like a cover thing ,
12069	0	a	because we
12070	0	a	No ,
12071	0	a	but
12072	0	a	But if we put that directly into the design , we limit ourselves extremely .
12073	0	a	Well ,
12074	1	a	you should not focus on the mostly on the covers ,
12075	0	a	because lot of things we came up with ,
12076	1	a	should not be too really too much should not be too focussed on the covers
12077	0	a	because it is kind of an idea of our own , but we are not sure if we can actually make that .
12078	0	a	Because it that is just for one seasonal trend .
12079	0	a	That is the one thing I am also afraid of with this one
12080	0	a	because it the edges are really they might stick out on the on the side for example .
12081	0	a	Well
12082	0	a	Oh .
12083	0	a	As a example .
12084	0	a	But I d
12085	1	a	If you have a basic design , a little m a little smaller on the on the s on the edges , you could put more covers on it , y one one with square or sharp corners if you want to .
12086	0	a	Okay ,
12087	0	a	so that is
12088	0	a	well ,
12089	0	a	that is probabl
12090	0	a	, you would just like it to go a little bit more like this .
12091	0	a	So
12092	0	a	M
12093	1	a	just round it off a little , I guess ,
12094	0	a	because so we have more options I suppose .
12095	0	a	I think so
12096	0	a	because it looks leaner
12097	0	a	and we should just go with that .
12098	0	a	Okay .
12099	0	a	Anyway , you have all the time in the world to make to make the final design in a minute with him .
12100	0	a	So So
12101	0	a	we decided on what
12102	0	a	what did you guys want to know again
12103	0	a	because this is
12104	0	a	anyway ,
12105	1	a	I will fire up my thing .
12106	0	a	So so
12107	1	a	we come to a decision .
12108	0	a	Did you present e everything you wanted to ?
12109	0	a	Okay .
12110	0	a	Yep .
12111	0	a	So
12112	0	a	I can qui
12113	0	a	oh .
12114	0	a	what the
12115	1	a	I can quickly make a conclusion of what we have decided so far .
12116	0	a	we still need to decide on a couple of things you you needed to know .
12117	0	a	Yeah .
12118	0	a	Okay , anyway .
12119	0	a	energy , we choose regular regular batteries .
12120	0	a	Yeah .
12121	0	a	The chip is advanced because we have the advanced features .
12122	0	a	The case , it will be the material will be rubber , suppose .
12123	0	a	Would not the b the design we talked about .
12124	0	a	user interface , type .
12125	0	a	Well
12126	0	a	I think we took all the components separately what we want .
12127	0	a	let is see
12128	0	a	supplements .
12129	0	a	I am not sure what they mean by that .
12130	0	a	Anyway ,
12131	0	a	apparently you guys , you should work together on the final design , both on internal and external design .
12132	0	a	So Yeah ,
12133	0	a	you should you should probably find out how the product will fall into the market ,
12134	0	a	how what is going to happen with the final design as we have it now .
12135	0	a	Yeah .
12136	0	a	So Yeah ,
12137	0	a	of course you have got your specific instruction as usual .
12138	0	a	Yeah
12139	0	a	And speech w recognition .
12140	0	a	So
12141	0	a	Wanna spend some more
12142	0	a	I think we are in a pretty much in agreement actually ,
12143	0	a	which is good .
12144	0	a	So
12145	0	a	Lef
12146	0	a	let is see ,
12147	0	a	where the pen go ?
12148	0	a	Here .
12149	0	a	Are we all in agreement about the , well , the primary structure of the of my design ?
12150	0	a	Except for the edges .
12151	0	a	Like the keys there .
12152	0	a	Yeah
12153	1	a	open your thing again .
12154	1	a	Let is see what if you can come up with anything new .
12155	1	a	I will just do a next one .
12156	0	a	So what would give us your ne your design would be
12157	0	a	the lights would be on top ,
12158	0	a	right ?
12159	0	a	one on each one on each side .
12160	0	a	Yeah .
12161	0	a	To create a kind of disco effect
12162	0	a	when you That was basically what w
12163	0	a	Light for the finding of the remote .
12164	0	a	Is it is it the lights for for finding the finding remote
12165	0	a	or lights that it that
12166	0	a	Yeah ,
12167	0	a	I think that should just be a simple LED or something .
12168	1	a	We can also use one light for showing that the signal is being sent .
12169	0	a	But
12170	1	a	So we have the teletext we have here , we have the mute .
12171	0	a	Like that
12172	0	a	that is not that important of course .
12173	0	a	It just like a matter of a a beep if you pre that you just know that that there is context .
12174	0	a	So I do not think that is super important .
12175	0	a	But .
12176	0	a	sh Oh .
12177	1	a	LCD screen .
12178	1	a	This is the on off button .
12179	0	a	Are we
12180	0	a	We Little voice Record and a
12181	0	a	no .
12182	0	a	Speech recognition ,
12183	0	a	I
12184	0	a	where did I imagine .
12185	0	a	I did that pretty much over here ,
12186	1	a	so that you could use it like this and speak to it .
12187	1	a	Then you have the extra keys for teletext , mute , two buttons which can be pretty much anything or nothing .
12188	1	a	We can also just not use them .
12189	0	a	Let is see ,
12190	1	a	I will just make
12191	1	a	One light here .
12192	1	a	Main controls and a key pad .
12193	0	a	Yeah .
12194	0	a	And just make it red now .
12195	1	a	But it could be any colour .
12196	0	a	So
12197	0	a	Okay , whatever .
12198	0	a	Will be fine .
12199	0	a	Fine , anyway .
12200	0	a	What do we have here ?
12201	0	a	M I will make it
12202	1	a	are we going to use square buttons or round ones actually ?
12203	1	a	Personally I would prefer round ones .
12204	0	a	Me too .
12205	0	a	Yeah ,
12206	0	a	but that would
12207	0	a	this was just in the design .
12208	1	a	Form of fruit .
12209	0	a	It is better .
12210	0	a	Because if you
12211	0	a	I had a square design .
12212	0	a	Yeah ,
12213	0	a	for
12214	0	a	Okay .
12215	0	a	So I had square buttons .
12216	0	a	But in that case the round buttons would be more appropriate .
12217	0	a	Okay ,
12218	0	a	I assume it for
12219	1	a	so we take a r take a round power button right here .
12220	0	a	Whatever .
12221	0	a	back to black .
12222	1	a	not too big though .
12223	0	a	See this would be good .
12224	0	a	let is see .
12225	0	a	Are these for any extra controls ?
12226	0	a	Okay .
12227	0	a	Yeah .
12228	0	a	The left one is teletext and the right one is mute .
12229	0	a	And these two buttons are or not necessary
12230	0	a	or
12231	0	a	Yeah , the triangles would be best indeed .
12232	0	a	Okay .
12233	0	a	If we go for for round buttons in general , do we want to the menu key in the middle to be round ?
12234	0	a	For example ,
12235	0	a	if you
12236	0	a	let is see ,
12237	0	a	put it this here .
12238	1	a	I think we will go with the triangles
12239	0	a	that
12240	0	a	Come on .
12241	0	a	Triangles are good .
12242	0	a	Yeah ,
12243	0	a	they are a little too big now .
12244	0	a	But
12245	0	a	Anyway ,
12246	0	a	okay .
12247	0	a	So
12248	0	a	do you want for example a round button in the middle or square one ?
12249	0	a	I am not sure ,
12250	0	a	I just just came up with it .
12251	0	a	I personally think that a round b button looks bit silly ,
12252	0	a	but
12253	0	a	Does everybody agree on that ?
12254	0	a	You prefer a round ?
12255	0	a	Okay .
12256	0	a	Yeah .
12257	0	a	This aligns nicely .
12258	0	a	So Okay .
12259	0	a	We will just take the take the round button , suppose .
12260	0	a	oh the square button ,
12261	0	a	sorry .
12262	0	a	Yep .
12263	0	a	I suppose so .
12264	0	a	I would prefer round .
12265	0	a	But does not matter , does not matter .
12266	0	a	Okay .
12267	0	a	That is not a big deal , think .
12268	0	a	So
12269	0	a	there is our numbers .
12270	1	a	Think we need an extra button here of course for
12271	1	a	yeah ,
12272	1	a	like you had for the higher numbers .
12273	1	a	And you could include a button here for the mute , I suppose .
12274	1	a	For something else ,
12275	0	a	just to mirror mirror the effect with this .
12276	0	a	Yeah , you can .
12277	0	a	But it but it is not necessary ,
12278	0	a	becau
12279	1	a	We could put our logo there .
12280	0	a	That is not necessary
12281	0	a	because it
12282	1	a	you can take this away ,
12283	0	a	but there it looks like there is a hole there , just to mirror the effect .
12284	0	a	Okay , so
12285	0	a	we have a few
12286	0	a	Nah ,
12287	1	a	I think it it would be nice to put the logo here , for example , if you have some buttons here .
12288	1	a	We could put a logo here
12289	0	a	because it is very always in your field of vision .
12290	0	a	And what about
12291	0	a	Oh .
12292	0	a	If you are watching it , the LCD screen , .
12293	0	a	What about a button for your favourite channel ?
12294	0	a	yeah .
12295	0	a	Oh
12296	0	a	that could be that b
12297	0	a	Well
12298	0	a	now it is getting a little bit too crowded up there .
12299	0	a	Well
12300	1	a	we could we could include either here or here , for example .
12301	0	a	With the extra controls .
12302	0	a	one one set
12303	0	a	Yeah ,
12304	1	a	you have to put it up
12305	0	a	One of the four .
12306	1	a	But you think here or here ?
12307	0	a	I know .
12308	0	a	So Is your
12309	1	a	So it can basically be the button down below or one of the four buttons up there .
12310	0	a	No ,
12311	1	a	we could put this one as favourite channel for exam
12312	0	a	What are these for ?
12313	0	a	Okay .
12314	0	a	Because
12315	0	a	One of the four is better , I suppose .
12316	0	a	, it is better than , I think .
12317	0	a	It is a favourite channel .
12318	0	a	What ?
12319	0	a	You are accustomed to eleven ?
12320	0	a	My
12321	0	a	okay , have it your way .
12322	0	a	What ?
12323	0	a	Nee ,
12324	0	a	one of the four
12325	0	a	It is better th
12326	0	a	Yeah .
12327	0	a	Because it is a little bit confusing to have twelve buttons down there , because you are only accustomed to eleven , I would say .
12328	0	a	I mean , think this looks rather like like there is something missing for example .
12329	0	a	Oh ,
12330	1	a	we still need an okay button .
12331	0	a	I mean why would not you include a
12332	0	a	cause there is a a piece of electronics under there anyway .
12333	0	a	So why not give it a function .
12334	0	a	Let is say I mean could be anything .
12335	0	a	Well ,
12336	1	a	you could also shift the two buttons to be nicely aligned .
12337	0	a	But th
12338	0	a	No , I do not think
12339	0	a	because this is a zero .
12340	0	a	But you want zero to be mis aligned with the rest .
12341	0	a	Anyway , so
12342	0	a	this is the basic design , we want to have on and off
12343	1	a	what are we missing ?
12344	0	a	If it looks
12345	0	a	Okay ,
12346	0	a	so we want the remote to be the s the side view actually ,
12347	1	a	what I am going to draw .
12348	0	a	Oh ,
12349	1	a	we are pretty much missing an okay button ,
12350	0	a	but we have a button up there which is still free .
12351	0	a	So
12352	0	a	Yeah , pretty much .
12353	0	a	So
12354	0	a	probably think you want the curve to be here .
12355	0	a	Just going to be sh
12356	0	a	Yeah .
12357	0	a	Want this straight or what ?
12358	1	a	Let is keep it at this .
12359	0	a	So it would be like this .
12360	1	a	Do we want something interesting with it
12361	0	a	or
12362	0	a	see .
12363	1	a	Would give us a light here .
12364	0	a	Maybe it is boring .
12365	0	a	You want it curved or what ?
12366	0	a	Maybe you want
12367	0	a	Should like this ?
12368	0	a	Will give us design problem
12369	0	a	because we have
12370	0	a	It can be curved .
12371	0	a	Well ,
12372	0	a	I think it looks better curved .
12373	0	a	But that is probably
12374	0	a	It can be curved ,
12375	0	a	because that
12376	0	a	yeah ,
12377	0	a	it is a little bit more trendy to be curved .
12378	0	a	Huh .
12379	0	a	It can be curved .
12380	0	a	Why ?
12381	0	a	Yeah .
12382	0	a	Yes .
12383	0	a	Okay ?
12384	0	a	I think so .
12385	0	a	That is why I asked you .
12386	0	a	Okay .
12387	0	a	So
12388	0	a	Oh crap .
12389	1	a	I would curve the whole actually .
12390	0	a	But it pretty much looks like a banana already .
12391	1	a	I would curve the whole .
12392	1	a	Like like it hangs over your hand a little bit .
12393	0	a	Then it will bounce and you do not drop it so easily .
12394	0	a	Yeah .
12395	0	a	Oh .
12396	0	a	Anyway , so
12397	0	a	you want to a little more like this ?
12398	0	a	And just s s
12399	0	a	Stop the curve here or continue it
12400	0	a	So we have our LCD screen .
12401	0	a	Yeah , something like that , yes .
12402	0	a	Uh huh .
12403	0	a	Yes , exactly .
12404	0	a	I think continue like that .
12405	0	a	Yep .
12406	0	a	Then there is also enough room for the electronics .
12407	0	a	Let is see .
12408	0	a	In Bana
12409	0	a	it is banana vision .
12410	0	a	Yeah .
12411	0	a	It is fruit .
12412	0	a	Yeah .
12413	1	a	Let is make it yellow then .
12414	0	a	Perfect .
12415	0	a	Maybe once we can make a special edition in according with Chiquita .
12416	0	a	Yeah , it is perfect .
12417	0	a	Yeah .
12418	1	a	So you have your LCD screen right here , suppose .
12419	0	a	that would make
12420	1	a	We use the colours now .
12421	0	a	But
12422	0	a	You got sponsor , now you get a free one with every pack of Chiquita .
12423	0	a	Have ourselves sponsored .
12424	0	a	but it is a good trade off for them if they can have their logo on it .
12425	1	a	So it would give the buttons here .
12426	1	a	Or they can design their own cover .
12427	0	a	They might want to be the first ones to
12428	0	a	Oh , perhaps they can use it .
12429	1	a	We could set up a a marketing agreement .
12430	0	a	I suppose I suppose we can put
12431	0	a	let is see .
12432	0	a	Yeah .
12433	1	a	I suppose we can put the batteries in here
12434	0	a	because it has the most space , for example .
12435	1	a	Or give a special edition
12436	0	a	with with
12437	0	a	Wo not that be a problem with the LCD screen ?
12438	0	a	Yeah ,
12439	0	a	but the LCD screen probably needs quite the chip .
12440	0	a	I do not think so because it is the biggest part of the of the
12441	0	a	Let is
12442	0	a	I think it is possible .
12443	0	a	I think this is possible .
12444	0	a	Okay .
12445	0	a	I think it is the best place
12446	0	a	yeah ,
12447	1	a	you could also put them here .
12448	0	a	Huh .
12449	0	a	But
12450	0	a	Okay ,
12451	0	a	so we put the batteries here .
12452	0	a	It does not matter .
12453	0	a	You can actually place a chip for the LCD screen and at the bottom , and and wire it .
12454	0	a	Does not matter .
12455	0	a	Okay , that is not a problem .
12456	0	a	Okay .
12457	0	a	Okay .
12458	0	a	That is fine .
12459	0	a	Yep .
12460	0	a	I think we get the idea .
12461	0	a	, any other com
12462	0	a	what
12463	0	a	what are we missing here ?
12464	0	a	Something
12465	0	a	a speech recognition .
12466	1	a	where do we want the microphone , for example , to be ?
12467	1	a	On the side or on the or , for example , on top ?
12468	1	a	Like here .
12469	0	a	Top ?
12470	0	a	W
12471	1	a	On there .
12472	0	a	Oh , basically
12473	1	a	the idea that I had was it to be pretty much in combination with the transmitter .
12474	1	a	I think on top .
12475	0	a	To be
12476	0	a	Okay ,
12477	0	a	I w thought maybe it is either be here or because it is mi it might interfere with the transmitter ,
12478	0	a	I am not sure .
12479	0	a	Cause you can talk to it like this .
12480	0	a	No .
12481	0	a	But
12482	0	a	Cause transmitter would be here .
12483	0	a	Well ,
12484	0	a	the email said it was a quite a small component .
12485	0	a	So I do not see that .
12486	0	a	Why
12487	1	a	once again , like you said , the component can be somewhere at the bottom while we wire the microphone up there .
12488	0	a	Anyway .
12489	0	a	yeah ,
12490	1	a	it could be either be here or make a double microphone .
12491	0	a	I would not mind .
12492	0	a	It is , I believe , also able to talk .
12493	0	a	It is able to talk to you .
12494	0	a	It is a
12495	0	a	Well ,
12496	0	a	the
12497	0	a	Yeah ,
12498	0	a	but do you actually need the remote talking back ?
12499	0	a	Beep .
12500	0	a	I have a sample sample sensor and the speaker sensor .
12501	0	a	A speaker sensor .
12502	0	a	the speaker sensor we already have , but s
12503	0	a	I do not know what they exactly mean by a sample sensor .
12504	0	a	Could it talk back ?
12505	0	a	Like g give confirmation or something .
12506	0	a	I think it can .
12507	0	a	I think if you have a a speech recognition component , then a s speaking component is not that hard to to put in either .
12508	0	a	I think so , it I think it could .
12509	0	a	Yeah .
12510	0	a	I mean it could be a
12511	1	a	all this stuff could be integrated into the LCD screen , which you could navigate with this , I suppose .
12512	1	a	Navigate through everything .
12513	0	a	If you have I think you sh
12514	0	a	I think the advanced options should be
12515	1	a	I think it sh the advanced option could also be integrated in the LCD screen , of course ,
12516	0	a	because you do not have to have a button for everything .
12517	0	a	But
12518	0	a	Yeah .
12519	1	a	You can just navigate through th m your menu that you have here for advanced options with this .
12520	0	a	Think that would be fine .
12521	0	a	So that is w m would be making use of the LCD screen .
12522	0	a	We already have a sound component , by the way , for the beep .
12523	0	a	So
12524	0	a	beep .
12525	0	a	Beep .
12526	0	a	Beep .
12527	0	a	, so
12528	0	a	the flashing of the beep , we have well anything .
12529	0	a	We could
12530	0	a	Yeah ,
12531	1	a	but you could put a speaker or something on on the side for example .
12532	1	a	At the back ,
12533	0	a	yeah .
12534	0	a	Like that .
12535	0	a	Or at the side .
12536	0	a	For
12537	0	a	how do you draw that again ?
12538	0	a	whatever , looks stupid .
12539	0	a	Which is .
12540	0	a	So what is basically edi the editi idea , sorry , now ?
12541	0	a	We need to stay here and work out that .
12542	0	a	I think this is pretty
12543	0	a	I think you have to stay here because we are supposed to five minutes to finish the meeting .
12544	0	a	I am not sure .
12545	0	a	Oh .
12546	0	a	I should be getting new information , I guess .
12547	0	a	Oh ,
12548	0	a	like my
12549	0	a	the info that I got was that you are we are going to work on our own because you are going to do the market market analysing
12550	0	a	I am supposed to do the little work on the year end report .
12551	0	a	Yep .
12552	0	a	So the project report .
12553	0	a	Okay .
12554	0	a	Okay ,
12555	0	a	I think we are
12556	0	a	everybody satisfied with the with the current design we have ?
12557	0	a	So we are s supposed to be rubber .
12558	0	a	Well ,
12559	0	a	I suppose we will
12560	0	a	Pretty much .
12561	0	a	Yes .
12562	0	a	, that is fine .
12563	0	a	I think
12564	0	a	well ,
12565	1	a	I think the the remote control is going to be black
12566	0	a	because we we forgot to talk about
12567	0	a	I mean the the company colours are important apparently .
12568	0	a	Round .
12569	0	a	Wh
12570	0	a	Why ?
12571	0	a	It is the colour of a
12572	0	a	But , the you
12573	0	a	The young people want a trendy remote control .
12574	0	a	So
12575	0	a	we have the logo up there .
12576	0	a	But we have
12577	0	a	any company logo .
12578	0	a	So are we going to
12579	0	a	base colour is black ?
12580	0	a	And yeah ,
12581	1	a	of course we could use yellow buttons or yellow navigation or whatever .
12582	0	a	We have
12583	0	a	yes ,
12584	0	a	but
12585	0	a	and yellow .
12586	0	a	I would change
12587	1	a	I would take a yellow remote control .
12588	0	a	Yellow
12589	0	a	but yellow control .
12590	0	a	It is
12591	0	a	Okay .
12592	0	a	To have it flashy ,
12593	0	a	to have it
12594	0	a	it is for young people .
12595	0	a	Yeah ,
12596	0	a	but when you use covers , it basically easier to have a n have a neutral colour on the base .
12597	0	a	Need do be different .
12598	0	a	Well ,
12599	1	a	do not do not stick yourself on the covers right now .
12600	1	a	But do not stick yourself on the cover
12601	0	a	because
12602	0	a	Nah .
12603	0	a	No ,
12604	0	a	we are designing the remote control now ,
12605	0	a	but taking that into consideration , it is better to have a neutral base colour than to have a flashy
12606	0	a	It is more trendy .
12607	0	a	But we need to be different .
12608	0	a	Yeah ,
12609	0	a	but the info .
12610	1	a	I think we should go with with the company colour
12611	0	a	because what specific info that I got from the project board .
12612	1	a	So I think we should go with that .
12613	0	a	They want something trendy .
12614	0	a	So colourful is
12615	0	a	Yeah .
12616	0	a	Huh .
12617	0	a	It is either black cover with yellow buttons or vice versa .
12618	1	a	And I would say take a yellow cover and black buttons .
12619	0	a	That is definitely true .
12620	0	a	I think we should th
12621	0	a	then take it take yellow .
12622	0	a	To be different .
12623	0	a	Take what you c yellow remote control .
12624	0	a	So
12625	1	a	let is see if if we can do the LED onto it .
12626	0	a	You have the basic colours , blue , green , red .
12627	0	a	oh .
12628	0	a	Yeah ,
12629	0	a	we have so many colours already .
12630	0	a	So Oh no ,
12631	0	a	that
12632	0	a	I think it is good thing to be different
12633	0	a	than
12634	0	a	Well .
12635	0	a	You know what ?
12636	1	a	I am not going to do this .
12637	0	a	Oh , it is okay .
12638	1	a	That is up to you guys .
12639	0	a	Yeah .
12640	1	a	You doodle a doodle us a nice nice design for for the next meeting ,
12641	0	a	we will be done .
12642	0	a	Colourful , you you
12643	0	a	Yep .
12644	0	a	I think we are all happy now .
12645	0	a	I still do not have my scroll wheel though .
12646	0	a	Yeah .
12647	0	a	Yeah .
12648	0	a	Stupid scroll wheel .
12649	0	a	that is
12650	0	a	Nah , that is true .
12651	0	a	Oh ,
12652	1	a	where would you like to put it ?
12653	0	a	you could use it for the channels and for the volume .
12654	0	a	Yeah .
12655	0	a	Kay
12656	0	a	I am not sure
12657	0	a	I really , I am no
12658	0	a	I have no clue what we could use the scroll wheel for .
12659	0	a	No , forget it .
12660	0	a	Oh yeah .
12661	0	a	But it is has no real added value .
12662	0	a	No look ,
12663	0	a	it
12664	0	a	No , that is not my point .
12665	0	a	You can may But scroll for a channel s selection or volume Ma
12666	0	a	Oh okay .
12667	0	a	It takes space , a lot of space .
12668	0	a	And it could
12669	0	a	I am not sure
12670	0	a	if it if it has no function , why even put it there ?
12671	0	a	And th that is just so much things that make it look flash
12672	0	a	I think channel selection would be annoying
12673	0	a	because it just c you could scroll past the channel
12674	0	a	or
12675	0	a	It is not because it is functional , but it is just to add to the design , to have it flashy .
12676	0	a	It it has no function , I agree .
12677	0	a	Yeah ,
12678	0	a	but if it has no function ,
12679	0	a	then
12680	0	a	Basically out .
12681	0	a	I agree .
12682	0	a	Oh ,
12683	0	a	so many things have no function , just design .
12684	1	a	Let is vote on it .
12685	0	a	Then we do not have to talk about it any longer .
12686	0	a	Oh okay .
12687	1	a	What do you want ?
12688	0	a	In or out ?
12689	0	a	Okay .
12690	0	a	I do not see the
12691	0	a	Do you have all your answers ?
12692	0	a	Okay .
12693	0	a	You are out of course .
12694	0	a	You are
12695	0	a	okay , clear .
12696	0	a	Out .
12697	0	a	No r no scroll wheel .
12698	0	a	Okay .
12699	0	a	I do not see anything missing really .
12700	0	a	Yeah ,
12701	0	a	we should
12702	0	a	too bad we do not have the finance .
12703	0	a	We could have
12704	0	a	Yeah ,
12705	0	a	it is
12706	0	a	I am not sure if we are if we are going to get finance anyway because I thought we cou
12707	0	a	I thought it was going to be an issue at the first time we started .
12708	0	a	I have all my answers , yes .
12709	0	a	I have to call this in a form .
12710	0	a	I thought it was going to be a cost issue which material we were going to take relative to the advanced chips or anything .
12711	0	a	There is
12712	1	a	I have one question .
12713	0	a	So you just do whatever you like and does not care what it costs .
12714	1	a	I only have one question with the material ,
12715	0	a	but I do not have information that .
12716	0	a	We have chosen rubber .
12717	0	a	I think we are
12718	0	a	rubber is not expensive .
12719	0	a	No ,
12720	0	a	but can we make yellow rubber ?
12721	0	a	I think so
12722	0	a	Okay .
12723	0	a	Definitely .
12724	0	a	You can make rubber in any colour .
12725	0	a	In any colour .
12726	0	a	So
12727	0	a	I mean you ca not make yellow titanium , but you can make yellow rubber .
12728	0	a	But we ha w
12729	0	a	we do not use our reco we removable cover ?
12730	0	a	No ,
12731	0	a	huh ?
12732	1	a	Maybe maybe later ,
12733	0	a	Okay .
12734	0	a	yeah
12735	0	a	we can make
12736	0	a	for example it is just something you can click on it
12737	0	a	like that is but it is not som not
12738	0	a	apparently that is not something we are working with in the basic design .
12739	0	a	So .
12740	0	a	Yeah , it could be .
12741	0	a	It can be done ,
12742	0	a	 
12743	0	a	Can I close this ?
12744	0	a	Oh , okay .
12745	0	a	we do not have any changes ,
12746	0	a	do we ?
12747	0	a	So no .
12748	0	a	There we go .
12749	0	a	Okay ,
12750	0	a	here we are again .
12751	0	a	Detailed design
12752	0	a	oh , come on .
12753	0	a	Well
12754	0	a	s
12755	0	a	Forgot to insert the minutes , but it is about the same thing we discussed before .
12756	1	a	Could open that anyway , think .
12757	0	a	Other design
12758	0	a	anyway , we took as we took w we took rubber as as the material last time .
12759	0	a	We also that you are just busy with it .
12760	0	a	Took the advanced chip to t implement the advanced features .
12761	0	a	Well ,
12762	0	a	we discussed the design , no sharp corners , we rounded it off , like you see on the other screen ,
12763	0	a	which is fine .
12764	0	a	we agreed that the colour should be b yellow and black .
12765	0	a	Yellow in the back because it is m trendy , more trendy than black anyway .
12766	0	a	So
12767	0	a	then we ca
12768	0	a	yeah .
12769	0	a	We agreed that we would implement both the LCD and speech recognition ,
12770	1	a	but I will get to that in a moment .
12771	0	a	Cause some changes in the finances have left us implications anyway .
12772	0	a	So so ,
12773	0	a	like I said , we had no insight in finances , no prices , but we have them now ,
12774	0	a	and it is bad .
12775	0	a	Anyway .
12776	0	a	We are
12777	0	a	Oh .
12778	0	a	Prototype presentation , well first you guys built the prototype .
12779	0	a	So
12780	1	a	you could could present that .
12781	1	a	But let is see what be handy to do .
12782	0	a	Nee no ,
12783	1	a	you just go ahead and present
12784	0	a	the w
12785	1	a	we will scrap it later
12786	0	a	because
12787	0	a	What ?
12788	0	a	Oh
12789	0	a	that is
12790	0	a	has not changed that much , huh ?
12791	0	a	I did not expect anyway .
12792	0	a	I think it is more or less the same as we had .
12793	0	a	It is basically what we agreed upon , but just a little bit more specified .
12794	0	a	yeah .
12795	0	a	No much s
12796	0	a	No no no , not at all .
12797	0	a	You just coloured it .
12798	0	a	s
12799	0	a	Final design .
12800	0	a	Basically in what we discussed , cover and buttons will be made of rubber , yellow colour , black components , as you can see right over here .
12801	0	a	We chose a different type of colour for the menu .
12802	0	a	I like the menu .
12803	0	a	A bit darker yellow so that it com really shows in this keypad .
12804	0	a	If you put them all black , it is not really that good a contrast .
12805	0	a	So
12806	0	a	Probab
12807	0	a	Yeah .
12808	1	a	And I suppose the the the yellow is not printed on the on the rubber .
12809	1	a	It is it is part of the rubber , I suppose .
12810	0	a	I think that is more I think that is more durable anyway than printed on to
12811	1	a	Oh yeah .
12812	0	a	That is the be
12813	0	a	And it I guess it is more easier to just paint it on the rubber
12814	0	a	than to
12815	0	a	So we have it is a bit round shaped , that is what we had We chose the buttons to be teletext , okay button , favourite channel and the mute .
12816	0	a	Yeah , of course .
12817	0	a	That is the integration story again .
12818	0	a	Okay .
12819	0	a	So that is basically what we chose there .
12820	0	a	Okay .
12821	1	a	If you have anything to add , please interrupt me .
12822	0	a	No ,
12823	0	a	this is just a description of what we see there .
12824	0	a	So
12825	0	a	Speaks for itself .
12826	0	a	Yeah .
12827	0	a	Yeah .
12828	0	a	Oh .
12829	0	a	That is pretty much it .
12830	0	a	Okay .
12831	1	a	Now it is my time to ruin everything .
12832	0	a	Well ,
12833	1	a	not ruin everything ,
12834	0	a	but
12835	0	a	no , nah .
12836	0	a	Oh sorry .
12837	0	a	Finances , that is what we have here , what you drew .
12838	0	a	We have battery power , we have advanced chips and the sam the sensor .
12839	0	a	The sample sensor and for speak recognition anyway .
12840	0	a	So which you see the
12841	0	a	which is de o one of the most expensive parts .
12842	0	a	So well ,
12843	0	a	we have sin one curve , a design .
12844	0	a	Rubber design .
12845	0	a	And we had a special colour .
12846	0	a	Suppose yellow is a special colour .
12847	0	a	So just half a Euro for You have pushbuttons and an LCD display .
12848	0	a	You have the total of seventeen Euros in production cost , which is higher than the twelve and a half that we are permitted to use .
12849	0	a	So ,
12850	0	a	easy .
12851	1	a	What do we scrap .
12852	0	a	Well
12853	1	a	think I had the best solution that I came up with is just to s take out the speech recognition .
12854	0	a	I d
12855	0	a	Yeah .
12856	0	a	I would say that too .
12857	0	a	Because the LCD has more support on customer side .
12858	0	a	There are ninety one percent of the people , or something like that .
12859	0	a	But ninety percent who favour an LCD display , and only sixty percent that favour speech recognition .
12860	0	a	I think it is also harder to .
12861	0	a	we do not really have a extra function with the speech sample , which you ca not do with a normal remote control , which people already do .
12862	0	a	Yeah .
12863	0	a	So
12864	0	a	Well ,
12865	0	a	I would I tend to disagree with you on that ,
12866	0	a	because the trend issue was a big issue when we started designing this .
12867	0	a	So I ju
12868	0	a	I took that out .
12869	0	a	So
12870	0	a	and so it is still stuck with thirteen , so
12871	0	a	I had to take out the special colour I suppose .
12872	0	a	And , yeah
12873	0	a	, I did not see anything else I could take out .
12874	0	a	Yeah ,
12875	0	a	I could take out the push buttons , but we need those .
12876	0	a	Pushbut
12877	0	a	Special colour , yeah .
12878	0	a	Huh .
12879	0	a	So , generally what I came up with , in order to be cou to to have production cost of twelve and a half Euros , spe scrap speech recognition and the separate covers can account for the if people want it ,
12880	1	a	we will just then we will do it in black .
12881	1	a	We will just deliver it in black ,
12882	0	a	have the
12883	0	a	it has all the function that it is supposed to have ,
12884	1	a	and if you want it if you want the custom design , then you can buy the separate covers .
12885	0	a	You make it d orange or whatever you want .
12886	0	a	It was a big issue , but
12887	1	a	I will just go back .
12888	0	a	So ca not we just basically extend it to thirteen ?
12889	0	a	Okay .
12890	0	a	let is just let is see what
12891	0	a	okay ,
12892	0	a	let is just see what we
12893	0	a	no , we we have to be under twelve and a half .
12894	0	a	Yeah ,
12895	0	a	it
12896	0	a	The p And the p What .
12897	0	a	It it is not
12898	0	a	the project is a no go if we go over twelve and a half ,
12899	0	a	so .
12900	0	a	Okay ,
12901	0	a	but there is another problem .
12902	0	a	But there is another problem .
12903	0	a	If we take another cover , for instance black , then we also need another button frame , cause black and black does not work obviously .
12904	0	a	I think you
12905	0	a	that is what you were ass assigned to do really , to to see how b th both those work together .
12906	0	a	Huh .
12907	0	a	Huh .
12908	0	a	Yeah .
12909	0	a	So I think
12910	0	a	yeah ,
12911	0	a	it is I think it is y one of the
12912	0	a	it is a good way to to help people to make to keep the product trendy too .
12913	0	a	Just keep you just make new covers for the for it , like we agreed before .
12914	0	a	Right .
12915	0	a	I agree .
12916	0	a	And everything that is left is is the basic function that that we want our product to have .
12917	0	a	Because the expensive parts are in either the advanced chip .
12918	0	a	But we need that for the LCD display .
12919	0	a	Yeah .
12920	0	a	We do .
12921	0	a	Then again , we have the LCD display , which is also expensive .
12922	0	a	B
12923	0	a	yeah ,
12924	0	a	but those go together .
12925	0	a	And yeah ,
12926	1	a	we could take out the curve .
12927	1	a	Or say let is lose rubber , take plastic .
12928	0	a	We could take out a curve indeed .
12929	0	a	Could
12930	1	a	we could take out the curve .
12931	0	a	Is that an option ?
12932	0	a	For you ?
12933	0	a	Yeah .
12934	0	a	Yes .
12935	0	a	Although we are demolishing a little bit the style .
12936	0	a	But the and
12937	0	a	Yeah .
12938	0	a	I think the colour is more important than the really the curve ,
12939	0	a	because if you just end up with an entirely black remote control
12940	0	a	So black and grey is okay .
12941	0	a	But
12942	0	a	Yeah .
12943	0	a	I think it is it it does ruin it ,
12944	0	a	but the fact that I t took that decision or t
12945	0	a	Took this example actually , not really decision , but the example is because we do offer the the possibility of adding your own custom covers .
12946	0	a	The people
12947	0	a	Spongy , yeah .
12948	0	a	So you can change any colour you want .
12949	0	a	So
12950	0	a	it is just you deliver a basic remote control with a possibility to change you into whatever you want .
12951	0	a	Can we then not also change the material ?
12952	1	a	We take plastic for the basic cover
12953	0	a	and
12954	1	a	We can put those to the to the other covers .
12955	0	a	You can take plastic ,
12956	0	a	but I d
12957	0	a	it is
12958	0	a	something that is stuck into my mind is that something that really came forward from the marketing research is that people like the the the the squishy feeling of the spongy feeling of the and it really makes it also makes it different from the existing remote controls , because they are all plastic .
12959	0	a	Yeah .
12960	0	a	And But
12961	0	a	But
12962	0	a	The people want to pay for for it ,
12963	0	a	so why why do we have to keep us on the twelve and a half ?
12964	0	a	Yeah .
12965	0	a	That is true .
12966	0	a	So which in in turn
12967	0	a	Rubber would increase durability because it does not break .
12968	0	a	But
12969	0	a	okay .
12970	1	a	But what do you then suggest we would lose ?
12971	0	a	Because we have to lose two things
12972	0	a	and I guess .
12973	0	a	I al
12974	1	a	like I said , I lost the speech recognition and I lost the special colour ,
12975	0	a	which would make this black a black and grey .
12976	0	a	Yes .
12977	0	a	Okay ,
12978	0	a	and that is enough ?
12979	0	a	Yeah , that is that that that is enough ,
12980	0	a	because
12981	0	a	I guess those are the basic colours .
12982	0	a	So Oh .
12983	0	a	Which we can fabricate ,
12984	0	a	okay .
12985	0	a	I think those are basic col They want to
12986	0	a	To ensure the profit .
12987	0	a	That that is th that is the order .
12988	0	a	We are just we are the project team and we got our our orders from the pro from the boss of our company which say we do not want to spend more than twelve fifty for this .
12989	1	a	But we can take a risk .
12990	0	a	But that is not for our
12991	0	a	that is not our decision to take .
12992	0	a	No ,
12993	0	a	we basically
12994	0	a	We need to stick to that .
12995	0	a	We have a budget of twelve fifty per product .
12996	0	a	Okay , yeah .
12997	0	a	So
12998	0	a	Stick that .
12999	0	a	I do not think it is really bad either .
13000	0	a	I mean if we we have the the backup of or the backup design thing
13001	0	a	to have
13002	0	a	I think they would do .
13003	0	a	I hope the people will like it ,
13004	0	a	but
13005	0	a	Yeah .
13006	0	a	Th I think they do like
13007	0	a	because yo we you
13008	0	a	we agree upon that the that the the the cover thing was a nice idea , because p you could have all sort of designs while at the same time just manufacturing one product , one basic product which you could turn into any any taste you want .
13009	0	a	So
13010	1	a	I think it is the best solution to make those cu custom covers for the design aspect and keep the functionality between of within the th the boundaries of the your f your budget .
13011	0	a	Perhaps we should make m
13012	0	a	Huh .
13013	0	a	Yeah .
13014	0	a	The first sheet .
13015	0	a	So
13016	0	a	Well
13017	0	a	I do not think
13018	0	a	Yeah .
13019	1	a	Perhaps we should make clear to our customer that we had to do this to stay under the cost .
13020	1	a	And that is they know that this is an option and that we had to drop the option to stay under the cost
13021	1	a	, that they know that .
13022	0	a	Perhaps they decide tha
13023	0	a	Of course .
13024	0	a	Is it worth is it is it
13025	0	a	does it mean anything to the customer ?
13026	0	a	Like , it like , we do not care we do not care that you had to
13027	0	a	True ,
13028	0	a	but we did we did not get that .
13029	0	a	But they do not
13030	0	a	Well
13031	0	a	And if we
13032	0	a	So which curve is that
13033	0	a	ba
13034	0	a	that is basically that curve .
13035	0	a	Perhaps they
13036	0	a	no ,
13037	0	a	but perhaps they think okay , the cover is such a nice idea , let is that
13038	0	a	that
13039	0	a	then they that allow us to make some more costs .
13040	0	a	We ca we we can at least tell them that
13041	0	a	You do not know that .
13042	0	a	So I think it is
13043	1	a	it should either be a pack , maybe we sh that should be sold in in the s in stores with with a standard cover or something .
13044	0	a	Huh .
13045	0	a	No , I am not talking about that cost
13046	0	a	but the one that g has given us the order to design this .
13047	0	a	But They could , but It is an option , but
13048	0	a	yeah , it is true .
13049	1	a	We could at least m make it like this , like you said , and then tell them okay , we had to drop this and that , just that you know .
13050	1	a	It is an still an option , but not for this price .
13051	0	a	So actually it is not that much of an increase ,
13052	0	a	but yeah .
13053	0	a	We cannot contact them .
13054	0	a	It is just the order that we got .
13055	0	a	Exactly ,
13056	0	a	but
13057	0	a	Yeah .
13058	0	a	So that is what we gotta go with .
13059	0	a	So it is either one fi just just to get it f
13060	1	a	just to get it through final ,
13061	0	a	it is either turned into plastic , drop the squishy feel , make it make it more breakable , or turn it yellow .
13062	0	a	Yeah .
13063	0	a	So
13064	0	a	It is something we have to decide on .
13065	1	a	I would say lose the curve and the colour
13066	0	a	and
13067	0	a	I say lose the curve .
13068	0	a	Oh that is true ,
13069	0	a	we could lose the c
13070	0	a	yeah ,
13071	0	a	I forgot that ,
13072	0	a	sorry .
13073	0	a	the curve .
13074	0	a	So
13075	0	a	That is just this one just d this is the banana curve .
13076	0	a	Yeah , that is better .
13077	1	a	So this would this would be straight .
13078	0	a	So we could u still have the comfort .
13079	0	a	No , no ,
13080	0	a	that would be a curve inside the thing , I guess .
13081	0	a	No ,
13082	0	a	would ju then it would just be a straight remote .
13083	0	a	Just like like that .
13084	0	a	Which would , yeah , turn it into something far more ordinary .
13085	1	a	we could make it yellow then ,
13086	0	a	but
13087	0	a	You second that , you second that we lose the curve .
13088	0	a	I second that .
13089	0	a	No ,
13090	0	a	that it would turn out to be a pretty straight forward remote control .
13091	0	a	Okay , yeah .
13092	0	a	So that is not really that I would
13093	0	a	Yeah .
13094	0	a	Yeah .
13095	0	a	Yeah .
13096	0	a	So I think it would be a good idea to keep the curve
13097	0	a	to separate it from the rest of the remote control world , so to speak .
13098	0	a	So we keep the curve .
13099	1	a	So the only only solution is either to use the l y lose the yellow or lose the rubber .
13100	1	a	And I am in favour of keeping the rubber ,
13101	0	a	because it has more more advantages than the colour yellow has .
13102	0	a	Oh .
13103	0	a	I agree .
13104	0	a	I would say I would agree with you on the colour ,
13105	0	a	because that is an extra option , an extra service we can deliver for a little bit of more money .
13106	0	a	No .
13107	0	a	Yep .
13108	0	a	So we can always do that .
13109	0	a	Yeah ,
13110	0	a	I guess people are willing to pay for that .
13111	1	a	So I think we can take that option and just with with the idea in the back of our head that you can customise your remote control .
13112	0	a	Yeah .
13113	0	a	Yes .
13114	0	a	So I think that would still make it a nice product .
13115	0	a	Okay ,
13116	0	a	we are final on that .
13117	0	a	So
13118	0	a	it is too bad we ca not make the whole super thing .
13119	0	a	But anyways we are here .
13120	0	a	yeah .
13121	0	a	Which is basically what we discussed .
13122	0	a	This we discussed just now .
13123	0	a	That is just now just
13124	1	a	we could just discuss how the project went .
13125	0	a	I mean , was kind of
13126	0	a	I sort of expected that everything would turn out this way ,
13127	0	a	but because you
13128	0	a	yeah ,
13129	0	a	everything cannot be for free .
13130	1	a	And I want to do that .
13131	0	a	We did not
13132	0	a	I think it was too bad we did not have the financial info the last time .
13133	0	a	Because that was I th
13134	0	a	it was really essential really
13135	0	a	to ma
13136	0	a	because we spent entire stage designing a product of which we had no idea what it would cost .
13137	0	a	Yes ,
13138	0	a	we could have
13139	0	a	Well
13140	0	a	I hope it sells .
13141	0	a	Huh .
13142	0	a	So we just put something
13143	0	a	I think it is really nor not in stroke with reality actually .
13144	0	a	Yeah .
13145	0	a	So
13146	0	a	Yeah .
13147	0	a	Me too , I felt a bit blind throughout the project , because in the beginning I had no list of available materials , and then I d had not list of available c finances .
13148	0	a	Yeah ,
13149	0	a	I think would have been .
13150	0	a	Yeah .
13151	0	a	But
13152	0	a	Let is see
13153	0	a	Let is
13154	0	a	Oh .
13155	0	a	Materials would be ok at least the last meeting I would have expected had to have that .
13156	0	a	So
13157	0	a	So I suppose
13158	0	a	Yeah ,
13159	0	a	let is see if it sells .
13160	0	a	I mean I suppose this sells , because it is very very extended .
13161	0	a	But
13162	0	a	I suppose it sells ,
13163	0	a	because it is good .
13164	0	a	I mean it is got everything for the for the reasonable price , because we did not know what it is going to cost anyway .
13165	0	a	Okay ,
13166	1	a	let is eval evaluate the product of us , our design .
13167	0	a	I have some a method , a requirements and scale of .
13168	0	a	I will pre present some statements and we will decided together wha what if it is true or false and then we see if the requirements of the user are fulfilled or not .
13169	0	a	Okay .
13170	0	a	Have been met , okay .
13171	1	a	And I will make a new blank sheet
13172	0	a	Yeah .
13173	0	a	So so the buttons , the look and feel .
13174	0	a	I thought it was okay , but the advanced settings , screen , audio and channel
13175	0	a	We are not
13176	0	a	Oh
13177	0	a	the menu button is it .
13178	0	a	Which are basically accessible through the menu button .
13179	0	a	They are stuck under menu .
13180	0	a	For the menu .
13181	0	a	I think those are totally met , because we we really took them for the they have the feel they want
13182	0	a	, they have the simplicity they want .
13183	0	a	Yeah .
13184	0	a	Hi
13185	0	a	Oh , okay .
13186	0	a	Then it is all S
13187	0	a	it is true .
13188	0	a	I think it is very very well met .
13189	0	a	Either two or one maybe .
13190	0	a	One .
13191	0	a	I think we took that everything they wanted into consideration .
13192	0	a	Yeah .
13193	0	a	So it could either be a two or a one .
13194	0	a	So d
13195	0	a	Oh wait .
13196	0	a	One and a half .
13197	0	a	pen .
13198	0	a	Which is not an option .
13199	0	a	The p
13200	0	a	Oh yeah ,
13201	0	a	it is red ,
13202	0	a	okay ,
13203	0	a	but
13204	0	a	Look and feel is everybo it is true .
13205	0	a	Just create our own option .
13206	0	a	Yeah .
13207	0	a	So
13208	0	a	Anyone ?
13209	0	a	And the next one yeah , when it is lost you can find it .
13210	0	a	It is perfect .
13211	0	a	Even for deaf people , yeah .
13212	0	a	It is
13213	0	a	Yeah .
13214	0	a	It is
13215	0	a	I do not think it is perfect , but we did everything possible to to get it back .
13216	0	a	To make it that way , yeah .
13217	0	a	Because if it is stuck in you couch , you can see the light .
13218	0	a	Maybe you can hear it .
13219	0	a	But I mean we tried ,
13220	0	a	so I think it that is that deserves a one .
13221	0	a	And it is and it is
13222	0	a	yeah .
13223	0	a	Definitely .
13224	0	a	To .
13225	0	a	That is okay then .
13226	1	a	And the next one .
13227	0	a	How is that ?
13228	0	a	w we had we do not have an manual ,
13229	0	a	yeah .
13230	0	a	Manual .
13231	0	a	But I think that is a part of it .
13232	0	a	I think the LCD display could be a little bit more difficult then a normal remote control , but then again , it is for young people .
13233	0	a	But
13234	0	a	Yeah ,
13235	0	a	an LCD , it tells a lot about
13236	0	a	Yeah .
13237	0	a	I would use an remote control .
13238	0	a	yeah .
13239	0	a	So
13240	0	a	Yeah ,
13241	0	a	I th
13242	0	a	Exactly .
13243	0	a	And it is pretty straight forward , you have a navigation no keys to navigate through the LCD menus .
13244	0	a	It is pretty straight forward , uh huh .
13245	0	a	No , that is true .
13246	0	a	I think it wo not be a big problem .
13247	0	a	So
13248	0	a	One I d no ,
13249	0	a	actu
13250	0	a	No ,
13251	0	a	it it is pretty straight forward .
13252	0	a	So it is a one
13253	0	a	or a
13254	0	a	I do not know .
13255	0	a	I think but we did not even
13256	0	a	there was no issue on making a manual actually .
13257	0	a	For the advanced settings .
13258	0	a	We did not really discuss it ,
13259	0	a	but I do not think it takes
13260	0	a	no , it really does does not take time to learn , I think .
13261	0	a	No okay , that that is true .
13262	0	a	We took it s
13263	0	a	it is so easy , we have so little button , everything speaks for itself really .
13264	0	a	Oh ,
13265	0	a	so it Takes no ti
13266	0	a	Yeah .
13267	0	a	So I think that is
13268	0	a	yeah ,
13269	0	a	we did not
13270	0	a	it is either two or one , I guess .
13271	0	a	With the more important functions on .
13272	0	a	Maybe it is a two ,
13273	0	a	because d the LCD is a little is a little new and there is there are some option hidden under the menu button .
13274	0	a	So I might make this a two instead of a one , I guess .
13275	0	a	Yeah .
13276	0	a	Yeah .
13277	0	a	And the LCD , you have to see it .
13278	1	a	So just make that a two .
13279	0	a	Oh ,
13280	0	a	it is a little bit learning .
13281	0	a	Okay .
13282	0	a	yeah
13283	0	a	it is a little bit same .
13284	0	a	But it tells you or not ?
13285	0	a	But wha w
13286	0	a	oh , yeah .
13287	0	a	You can use the LCD in a good way .
13288	0	a	I think so .
13289	0	a	I think it is perfect , the w where it is , what it can do , if it useful .
13290	0	a	I think so .
13291	0	a	What are we displaying on the LCD screen ?
13292	0	a	Just only the channels and or
13293	0	a	What ?
13294	0	a	Oh , in the LCD screen .
13295	0	a	the menus Things like brightness and those kind of things we have put in the menu , because we have no buttons for those .
13296	0	a	Well ,
13297	0	a	basically the menu options indeed .
13298	0	a	But
13299	0	a	No .
13300	0	a	No ,
13301	0	a	y
13302	0	a	I mean in the LCD screen , the small screen .
13303	0	a	Yes .
13304	0	a	What does it display ?
13305	0	a	Well
13306	0	a	I thought it was
13307	0	a	I thought it was
13308	0	a	I thought that people wanted previews on their I am not sure if that even possible ,
13309	0	a	but
13310	0	a	cause it is this requires a quite quite a bit of band width .
13311	0	a	And for a channel selection , or that is not
13312	0	a	Yeah , I thought I thought too
13313	0	a	but
13314	0	a	yeah .
13315	0	a	I do not think it is possible really .
13316	0	a	But the
13317	0	a	they did not really define in what should be used for .
13318	1	a	Maybe a TV guide or something in your LCD
13319	0	a	Yeah .
13320	1	a	But I think in for example like TV guides , I think that is that th that you can transmit through it and everything .
13321	1	a	Just for extra information on your programmes .
13322	0	a	Yeah ,
13323	0	a	it must be clear then what what what for we use it .
13324	0	a	But also things like like like menus or p how about preferences of your
13325	1	a	with configuring your remote control for favourite your favourite channel for example , how do you configure that .
13326	0	a	Yeah .
13327	0	a	Yeah .
13328	1	a	So that could be done by LCD display .
13329	0	a	I think it is good .
13330	0	a	No , maybe it is not a one because it is we are not using it perfectly .
13331	0	a	We did not give it I do not thing over discussing .
13332	0	a	Now we gave it enough thought though .
13333	0	a	Yeah .
13334	1	a	I think we d should just lower this .
13335	0	a	Maybe maybe it is a three though .
13336	0	a	We could have used it more effectively probably .
13337	0	a	Yeah , indeed .
13338	0	a	So
13339	0	a	everybody is agree with an three on it ,
13340	0	a	it is W
13341	0	a	Yeah .
13342	0	a	Yes .
13343	0	a	Yeah .
13344	0	a	Yeah ,
13345	0	a	we are using it ,
13346	0	a	but it is not
13347	0	a	it is not poorly used , but it is not efficiently used , I think .
13348	0	a	Two or three .
13349	0	a	So You can seven .
13350	1	a	We could have ev even lost the selection button and done everything via LCD selection .
13351	0	a	Yeah .
13352	0	a	It is
13353	0	a	now it is just extra to illustrate im extra features ,
13354	0	a	but okay .
13355	0	a	Yeah ,
13356	0	a	I
13357	0	a	A three .
13358	0	a	Nah , it is not really only an extra .
13359	0	a	, nothing , that is A seven .
13360	0	a	No menus .
13361	0	a	Think about
13362	0	a	that is
13363	0	a	Yeah .
13364	0	a	Can you talk to remote control ?
13365	0	a	Well ,
13366	0	a	it ca not talk anymore .
13367	0	a	Or we could say it
13368	1	a	Or we could say neutral ,
13369	0	a	we cause we scratched the C
13370	0	a	No , we do not have the colour .
13371	1	a	So we scrap that .
13372	0	a	Oh yeah
13373	0	a	Just to be a prick ,
13374	0	a	but of course you can talk to your remote control , it does not do anything .
13375	0	a	Yeah
13376	0	a	yeah
13377	0	a	yeah
13378	0	a	yeah .
13379	0	a	But you c you can talk to it .
13380	0	a	Not with the speech recognition .
13381	0	a	yeah ,
13382	0	a	all the trends and no colours anymore .
13383	0	a	So
13384	0	a	Yeah ,
13385	0	a	only in the curves .
13386	0	a	Well ,
13387	0	a	we did take everything into consideration of course .
13388	0	a	the shape i shape is i
13389	0	a	I think
13390	0	a	we
13391	0	a	yeah ,
13392	0	a	I think that is okay .
13393	0	a	But the colours , we do not have special colours on it .
13394	0	a	Yeah ,
13395	0	a	special co
13396	0	a	but we took into consideration the fact that it is customisable
13397	0	a	to the fashi
13398	0	a	We do not have it
13399	0	a	we do have it ,
13400	0	a	it is just sold as a package .
13401	0	a	So I
13402	0	a	Yes ,
13403	0	a	but the end product
13404	0	a	So
13405	0	a	Maybe we should go with a two then , because it is not perfect ,
13406	0	a	because we ca not do it initially ,
13407	0	a	but we
13408	0	a	Yeah .
13409	0	a	Yeah ,
13410	0	a	but we
13411	0	a	yeah ,
13412	0	a	we do not have it ,
13413	0	a	so d In the end product .
13414	0	a	But M
13415	0	a	Changing covers is also trend that we followed .
13416	0	a	It does
13417	0	a	it is not part of the basic product .
13418	0	a	It that
13419	0	a	that is what I call trendy .
13420	0	a	I mean the shape is trendy .
13421	0	a	The the sh the the functions are trendy .
13422	0	a	It is just the colours that are not supporting the basic model .
13423	0	a	Now
13424	0	a	But it is not a one .
13425	0	a	Because you ha
13426	0	a	it is just not affordable at the moment .
13427	0	a	Yeah .
13428	0	a	Oh .
13429	0	a	It is possible , but you have to pay extra for the for the possibility of having it in a f a different colour .
13430	0	a	Oh well Oops .
13431	0	a	Oh it is a two ,
13432	0	a	right ?
13433	0	a	On the last one .
13434	0	a	that n that is all .
13435	0	a	Overall score .
13436	0	a	Overall score .
13437	0	a	Overall .
13438	0	a	It is
13439	0	a	ten , sixteen three two
13440	0	a	two point seven or something like that .
13441	0	a	One two three .
13442	0	a	sixteen .
13443	0	a	Two two point some two point something .
13444	0	a	I do not know why .
13445	0	a	Ten , sixteen , divided by Is two two third .
13446	0	a	Six .
13447	0	a	Six .
13448	0	a	Two and two thirds .
13449	0	a	So
13450	0	a	we can say it is it is the product is it is okay .
13451	0	a	It is okay ,
13452	0	a	but that is yo m
13453	0	a	mostly it is it is influenced by the fact that we did not have enough resources to implement speech recognition .
13454	0	a	Y not
13455	0	a	Yeah .
13456	0	a	There is
13457	0	a	Yeah ,
13458	0	a	if we make it into a four , as in neutral , because we did not implement it , so we ca not say that we that it is really not well implemented .
13459	0	a	Cause
13460	0	a	yeah ,
13461	0	a	that gives you a seven , which ruins your your average .
13462	0	a	Without that it would be like under it would not
13463	0	a	yeah , it would be under two .
13464	0	a	So I think we have even with this it is reasonable .
13465	0	a	Woah .
13466	0	a	Yeah .
13467	0	a	We come out on a average of two one eighth .
13468	0	a	Well
13469	0	a	I think it is
13470	0	a	two is okay .
13471	0	a	So
13472	0	a	which is pretty w good .
13473	0	a	Yeah , two is pretty good .
13474	0	a	It is at least on the positive side .
13475	0	a	So
13476	0	a	We could definitely have done better if we have had more resources ,
13477	0	a	but
13478	0	a	Yeah .
13479	0	a	, of course .
13480	0	a	Definitely .
13481	0	a	Yeah .
13482	0	a	Yeah ,
13483	0	a	I think it is probably I
13484	0	a	I do admit that we d did miss a little or did not sp did not talk talk enough about the possibility of the LCD display .
13485	0	a	Yeah .
13486	0	a	We could have used it more efficiently , we just did not think of it that way .
13487	0	a	Yeah .
13488	0	a	Yeah ,
13489	0	a	with .
13490	0	a	True .
13491	0	a	So
13492	1	a	like I said , changing channels , everything hidden in your LCD display , so you just need the navigation buttons to do everything .
13493	0	a	The scale .
13494	0	a	But I think for this price , this is it is really a reasonable product .
13495	0	a	I think we div
13496	0	a	I think we did very well , ev
13497	0	a	even if you look at this score , we did quite well .
13498	0	a	It is a good product .
13499	0	a	Yeah .
13500	0	a	With an LCD screen .
13501	0	a	Oh .
13502	1	a	It just looking for improvements what what you could have improved .
13503	0	a	Oh .
13504	0	a	Yeah .
13505	0	a	So .
13506	0	a	But if pep people really want speech recognition , then they must be prepared to pu to pay more , because it is cannot be done for this .
13507	0	a	Yeah ,
13508	0	a	you can make them another one .
13509	0	a	They sh they should get kids , and just stick them in TV and say change the channel .
13510	0	a	yeah .
13511	0	a	but for this price you cannot ask that .
13512	0	a	I do not think so .
13513	0	a	You cannot th think of that
13514	0	a	No , it is not .
13515	0	a	it is just not it it is not affordable .
13516	1	a	Or your sh you should lose the LCD screen probably ,
13517	0	a	but I think that is I think the LCD screen is more worth than speech recognition .
13518	0	a	Oh It is also more attractive .
13519	0	a	Definitely .
13520	0	a	Okay ,
13521	0	a	that was that .
13522	0	a	Yeah .
13523	0	a	Yeah .
13524	0	a	So that is the final product without the speakers , I guess .
13525	0	a	So did you
13526	0	a	Yeah .
13527	0	a	Let is see ,
13528	0	a	what was left in the the Another one .
13529	0	a	Yeah ,
13530	0	a	we evaluate the product .
13531	0	a	General project , what is i in
13532	0	a	For example , I thou I thought we were pretty creative in what we created .
13533	0	a	We took the whole new approach of making exchangeable cover for example , which I thought was pretty creative , because it was never never ever listed somewhere .
13534	0	a	Favourite channel .
13535	0	a	Well Anyways .
13536	0	a	Yeah ,
13537	0	a	leadership is up to you .
13538	0	a	I mean perhaps I screwed up
13539	0	a	because I d put a put a speech recognition into it .
13540	0	a	But that is not for me to decide .
13541	0	a	Yeah , I know .
13542	0	a	I think we did pretty well as team work though .
13543	0	a	Yeah .
13544	0	a	Because , yeah was very hard to work with one another if you cannot communicate in the meantime , because when I got the when I got the input for the financial results , initially of course I wanted to contact you .
13545	0	a	Yes .
13546	0	a	Yeah , you are working separate .
13547	0	a	Yeah .
13548	0	a	Say , look , this is you are doing the wrong thing , you are s
13549	0	a	you are wasting your time now , because we are implementing stuff that we cannot afford .
13550	0	a	Yeah .
13551	0	a	Huh .
13552	0	a	Yeah ,
13553	0	a	yeah
13554	0	a	yeah .
13555	0	a	So it would be better if y if there was more communication between
13556	0	a	because that is that is what would w you what you would normally do , either call or email someone .
13557	0	a	Yeah
13558	0	a	yeah
13559	0	a	yeah .
13560	0	a	Direct communication with
13561	0	a	yeah .
13562	0	a	And we could share information which we received .
13563	0	a	So that was too bad
13564	0	a	con
13565	0	a	was impossible here anyways .
13566	0	a	That is the same thing that I had in the beginning .
13567	0	a	Everybody was using materials that s I did not have .
13568	0	a	So
13569	0	a	Oh .
13570	0	a	It did not have or did not knew what they costs or whatever .
13571	0	a	Yeah .
13572	0	a	There was just too little information about what things actually cost and if you could use them .
13573	0	a	Yeah .
13574	0	a	So that was a little unclear I suppose .
13575	0	a	I think a SMARTboard SMARTboard is pretty cool .
13576	0	a	I think s especially for design issues , it is very easy just to give your give your thoughts a little it is easier to share them .
13577	0	a	My handwriting is little bit
13578	0	a	yeah .
13579	0	a	Yeah .
13580	1	a	Although for actual design I would say the response time should be a little bit higher ,
13581	0	a	because
13582	0	a	The digital pen was definitely better to draw my ideas and to further elaborate on that .
13583	0	a	It is a little less it
13584	0	a	the response time is le it is very bad .
13585	0	a	It is good to visualise everything ,
13586	1	a	but I think the response time should could be a lot better .
13587	0	a	But th that is
13588	0	a	Yeah , okay .
13589	0	a	Definitely .
13590	0	a	Yeah , it is true .
13591	0	a	So
13592	0	a	Oh can you ?
13593	0	a	Okay .
13594	0	a	But there is also one problem with this I noticed .
13595	0	a	you have to finish a page before going to a
13596	0	a	n
13597	0	a	Oh .
13598	0	a	No , you do not have to .
13599	0	a	No .
13600	0	a	No , you do not .
13601	0	a	I jin
13602	0	a	I did not check the finish button .
13603	0	a	You can
13604	0	a	Done and then it is okay .
13605	0	a	I just
13606	0	a	you just ditch it and you can copy it or whatever .
13607	0	a	Okay ,
13608	0	a	I saw that
13609	0	a	only if you check the notes or press done .
13610	0	a	Then it then you can then it exports to Word automatically .
13611	0	a	But it is not necessary to check either one of those two .
13612	0	a	You can just preview your p you can just preview your page in the in the programme .
13613	0	a	Yeah ,
13614	0	a	but I made
13615	0	a	Okay ,
13616	0	a	but I made three pages and they were not finished .
13617	0	a	Oh , okay .
13618	0	a	Okay , yeah .
13619	0	a	And when the third one was finished , I wanted to download it
13620	0	a	and then it was not possible anymore , because you have to close all the pinnits the pages before going further .
13621	0	a	Okay ,
13622	0	a	before starting a ne a new page .
13623	0	a	Okay .
13624	0	a	Okay , that could be b .
13625	0	a	Exactly .
13626	0	a	So we cannot work on more than one page at same time .
13627	0	a	Oh .
13628	0	a	That is not possible .
13629	0	a	You have to finish it completely , then download it ,
13630	0	a	it is
13631	0	a	then start a new one .
13632	0	a	Okay .
13633	0	a	Yeah , okay .
13634	0	a	That is not very handy ,
13635	0	a	but if you know that , then it is not a problem .
13636	0	a	That is
13637	0	a	Yeah ,
13638	0	a	it is understandable , okay .
13639	0	a	Any new ideas ?
13640	0	a	Yeah ,
13641	0	a	more communication between between
13642	0	a	that is the thing I noticed , that communication is very very important , because if you get new information , it is essential f for the other team mates to know that as soon as possible , because you would avoid making doing extra work , because you were doing extra work now m working on the on the speech recognition , you have limitation both on the technical on the d on the design side .
13643	0	a	Important to
13644	0	a	Yeah .
13645	0	a	So I think that could have been better .
13646	0	a	But that is I think it is more of a a setting here that you cannot communicate than than somewhere else .
13647	0	a	So
13648	0	a	Yeah , I think so .
13649	0	a	Yeah , well
13650	1	a	it could also possibly be well , is it a more real time information base ,
13651	0	a	so we can all see which information is available to one another .
13652	1	a	And l less p less spam probably .
13653	0	a	I am not sure i I am not sure you got spammed as well ,
13654	0	a	but I get spammed like every t every two minutes
13655	0	a	there was
13656	0	a	a there was another email about master classes or something .
13657	0	a	Well .
13658	0	a	So
13659	0	a	which were totally useless actually .
13660	0	a	I thought I should probably look into them ,
13661	0	a	but they were all useless .
13662	0	a	So I just
13663	0	a	Oh okay .
13664	0	a	Well ,
13665	0	a	I personally did not have that ,
13666	0	a	but
13667	0	a	That is probably your l description .
13668	0	a	Yeah ,
13669	0	a	after After five minutes ,
13670	0	a	Yeah .
13671	0	a	But I also did not not really .
13672	0	a	But still ,
13673	0	a	you had that as well .
13674	0	a	Huh .
13675	0	a	Is that we finished up the design
13676	0	a	and then we checked the website , and then there was just extra information .
13677	0	a	Yeah .
13678	0	a	Yeah ,
13679	0	a	There was a little delay in the bit of a c crucial delay .
13680	0	a	I did not have any more information , it is just always the same here .
13681	0	a	So that is that is kind of a
13682	0	a	It would change , but not for me .
13683	0	a	Email it is
13684	0	a	Yeah .
13685	0	a	So I would I had no extra information to go on that one than what you give me actually .
13686	0	a	I could not do any research myself
13687	0	a	or I see , that is
13688	0	a	yeah ,
13689	0	a	w
13690	0	a	I could have done a little extra work probably ,
13691	0	a	then
13692	0	a	But I was busy enough anyway .
13693	0	a	So
13694	0	a	Any new ideas found ?
13695	0	a	Or is that a cause
13696	0	a	yeah , it is well ,
13697	0	a	probably is .
13698	0	a	No .
13699	0	a	How much time do we have for this anyway ?
13700	0	a	Yeah .
13701	0	a	I have no clue .

13740	0	a	Product name .
13741	0	a	Huh .
13742	0	a	It is better than thi I think than a serial number .
13743	0	a	Sony TR something f means nothing to me .
13744	1	a	Or fruit name .
13745	1	a	Like fruit names .

13766	0	a	yeah .
13767	0	a	Well ,
13768	1	a	I was going for the RC deluxe ,
13769	0	a	but it is not really a catchy name or anything ,
13770	0	a	it is more
13771	1	a	Something with our company name ,
13772	1	a	can we do anything with that ?
13773	0	a	Maybe there is something on the website which will help us out .
13774	0	a	Yeah .
13775	0	a	at least it is not something with numbers .
13776	0	a	Numbers are so meaningless to the people .
13777	0	a	I mean .
13778	0	a	That is true .
13779	0	a	Reaction , Real Reaction .
13780	0	a	Real Reaction .

13782	1	a	Real Reaction future RC .
13783	1	a	Step into the future of of remote controlling your TV .
13784	0	a	Is that a name or a c campaign ?
13785	0	a	Yeah .
13786	0	a	No that is a that is a catchy slogan .
13787	0	a	Or the
13788	1	a	The real reactor .
13789	1	a	Control your remote control .
13790	0	a	Real react .
13791	0	a	I go for future RC probably .
13792	0	a	Something like It is short f
13793	0	a	Real reactor ?
13794	0	a	that that is
13795	0	a	That makes me think of different products than a remote control really .
13796	0	a	The Real Reactor , I do not find that that bad at all .
13797	0	a	Yeah .
13798	1	a	You should write it down as a an option .
13799	0	a	Because our name is Real Reaction .
13800	0	a	I am not sure .
13801	0	a	Real reaction in a real
13802	0	a	Real reactor .
13803	0	a	Zapping .
13804	0	a	The
13805	0	a	Yeah , sure .
13806	0	a	So that is one option .
13807	0	a	Did not notice .
13808	0	a	I am looking for things in the name .
13809	0	a	So that the first three letters are s the same .
13810	0	a	Should I write the banana down or Sure ?
13811	0	a	Well
13812	0	a	I do you mean it like
13813	0	a	You mean it like this ?
13814	0	a	Dash C ?
13815	1	a	Like a C right now or a dash in a C ?
13816	0	a	Is it triple RCs ?
13817	0	a	No .
13818	0	a	REA REA .
13819	0	a	I take f
13820	0	a	yeah ,
13821	0	a	take a banana .
13822	0	a	The banana .
13823	0	a	Remote .
13824	0	a	Banana recei RC .
13825	1	a	The triple R .
13826	1	a	Real Reaction remotes control .
13827	0	a	Remote .
13828	1	a	Triple R .
13829	1	a	R three C .
13830	0	a	yeah .
13831	0	a	R three C .
13832	0	a	Yeah ,
13833	0	a	that .
13834	0	a	Real Reaction Remote Control .
13835	0	a	R three C .
13836	0	a	Oh yeah .
13837	0	a	No , not like that .
13838	1	a	It should be it should be longer ,
13839	0	a	because it is not a product name that you f print on a box .
13840	1	a	I think triple R .
13841	0	a	Does not sound ?
13842	0	a	Yeah .
13843	1	a	Just write out triple , like a word triple RC , triple stripe
13844	1	a	Oh .
13845	0	a	Yeah , triple R .
13846	1	a	Triple dash R dash s s C .
13847	1	a	Triple RC .
13848	0	a	The triple RC , yeah .
13849	0	a	Yeah .
13850	1	a	R s R three C .
13851	1	a	R dash C .
13852	0	a	I think I like it like this more .
13853	0	a	Dash .
13854	1	a	Triple R or triple RC ?
13855	1	a	How about do both ?
13856	0	a	Sure if it looks stupid .
13857	1	a	Triple R dash .
13858	0	a	I think that the the RC together takes away the the the image of it is a triple
13859	0	a	the first the first one looks like it is a triple remote control , but it is only a single remote control .
13860	0	a	That
13861	0	a	Yeah ,
13862	0	a	this
13863	0	a	yeah .
13864	0	a	And it is especially on the triple R that is important .
13865	1	a	I would huh .
13866	0	a	The Real Reaction Remote .
13867	1	a	I would lose the C and just name it triple R .
13868	0	a	It sounds like thinking about two different things and combining it .
13869	0	a	Triple remote .
13870	1	a	I would just say triple Rs triple R
13871	0	a	That is also short , catchy .
13872	0	a	Yeah .
13873	0	a	Yeah , triple R
13874	0	a	yeah ,
13875	0	a	you can
13876	0	a	Yeah , triple R .
13877	0	a	Well ,
13878	0	a	that is another option .
13879	0	a	It is okay .
13880	0	a	Okay , so
13881	1	a	which ones are we going to scratch definitely ?
13882	1	a	I say this one as well .
13883	1	a	The banana .
13884	1	a	Banana .
13885	1	a	Banana remote .
13886	1	a	Banana .
13887	0	a	Yeah ,
13888	1	a	the deluxe .
13889	0	a	I think we are all in agreement about the triple R .
13890	0	a	I think triple R is cool .
13891	0	a	Yes .
13892	0	a	The r triple R .
13893	0	a	Triple R ?
13894	0	a	Triple R it is .
