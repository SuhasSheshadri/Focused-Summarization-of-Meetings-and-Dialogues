but if someone d somebody else uses it in ano other room or something ?
So if you deliver a small click on device that you can put on your television , that bleeps to your remote control , everyone can use it .
So the the learning curve should be very short for the dumbest people should be able to use it .
So you can pick up and use it , than I think .
So it is very important we should definitely have that in our designs .
We can make a symbol of the company right here .
Or the th the the lowest part of the remote is not changed by the front .
I think this is about the maximum number of buttons we need .
And well if y if your remote picks that up also , you they can display which programme you are currently watching .
So it it just signals the the different sig the different symbols on the screen you have , because if you change to s channel two you have two on the screen and two on your on your on your LCD screen .
So we want to have a small LCD screen that is special .
W would we have to choose a way in middle ?
I think you can have the two buttons of up and down close together , but you do not have have to have volume control and and zapping button close together .
I do think you have to keep you have to keep it central now .
Well consensus , We we can put it in the middle , so
Are we going to do it like on Mike is screen with one button that says I am going to do a t two number digital ?
It it has to r recognise one as there could still come more .
And you can then adjust it with the zapping buttons or something .
