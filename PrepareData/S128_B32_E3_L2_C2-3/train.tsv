1	0	a	Okay
2	0	a	Right
3	0	a	well this is the kick off meeting for our our project .
4	0	a	and
5	0	a	this is just what we are going to be doing over the next twenty five minutes .
6	0	a	so first of all , just to kind of make sure that we all know each other
7	0	a	, I am Laura
8	0	a	and I am the project manager .
9	0	a	Do you want to introduce yourself again ?
10	0	a	Okay .
11	0	a	Great .
12	0	a	Hi , I am David and I am supposed to be an industrial designer .
13	0	a	And I am Andrew and I am our marketing expert .
14	0	a	I am Craig and I am User Interface .
15	0	a	Great .
16	0	a	Okay .
17	0	a	so we are designing a new remote control and
18	1	a	Oh I have to record who is here actually .
19	0	a	So that is David , Andrew and Craig , is not it ?
20	0	a	And you all arrived on time .
21	0	a	yeah
22	0	a	so des design a new remote control .
23	0	a	, as you can see it is supposed to be original , trendy and user friendly .
24	0	a	so that is kind of our our brief , as it were .
25	0	a	and so there are three different stages to the design .
26	0	a	I am not really sure what what you guys have already received in your emails .
27	0	a	What did you get ?
28	0	a	, I just got the project announcement about what the project is .
29	0	a	Designing a remote control .
30	0	a	That is about it , did not get anything else .
31	0	a	Yeah , that is that is it .
32	0	a	Is that what everybody got ?
33	0	a	Okay .
34	0	a	Yeah .
35	0	a	Did you get the same thing ?
36	0	a	Cool .
37	0	a	Yeah .
38	0	a	So we are going to have like individual work and then a meeting about it .
39	0	a	And repeat that process three times .
40	0	a	and at this point we get try out the whiteboard over there .
41	0	a	So you get to draw your favourite animal and sum up your favourite characteristics of it .
42	1	a	So who would like to go first ?
43	0	a	Very good .
44	1	a	I will go .
45	1	a	That is fine .
46	0	a	Alright .
47	0	a	So
48	0	a	This one here , right ?
49	0	a	Okay .
50	0	a	Very nice .
51	0	a	Alright .
52	0	a	My favourite animal is like A beagle .
53	0	a	charac favourite characteristics of it ?
54	0	a	Is that right ?
55	0	a	, right , well basically high priority for any animal for me is that they be willing to take a lot of physical affection from their family .
56	0	a	Yeah .
57	0	a	Yeah .
58	0	a	And , yeah that they have lots of personality and be fit and in robust good health .
59	0	a	So this is blue .
60	0	a	Blue beagle .
61	0	a	My family is beagle .
62	0	a	Right .
63	0	a	Lovely .
64	0	a	Well , my favourite animal would be a monkey .
65	0	a	Then they are small cute and furry , and when planet of the apes becomes real , I am going to be up there with them .
66	0	a	Right .
67	0	a	There is too much gear .
68	1	a	You can take as long over this as you like ,
69	0	a	because we have not got an awful lot to discuss .
70	0	a	Ok oh
71	0	a	we do we do
72	1	a	Do not feel like you are in a rush , anyway .
73	0	a	Okay .
74	1	a	I coulda told you a whole lot more about beagles .
75	0	a	Ach why not
76	1	a	We might have to get you up again then .
77	0	a	Boy , let me tell you .
78	0	a	I do not know what mine is .
79	1	a	I am going to have to think on the spot now .
80	0	a	Impressionist .
81	0	a	Ca not draw .
82	0	a	Is that a whale ?
83	0	a	Yeah .
84	0	a	, well anyway ,
85	0	a	I do not know , it is just the first animal I can think off the top of my head .
86	0	a	Yes .
87	0	a	Big reason is cause I am allergic to most animals .
88	0	a	Allergic to animal fur , so fish was a natural choice .
89	0	a	, yeah ,
90	0	a	and I kind of like whales .
91	0	a	They come in and go eat everything in sight .
92	0	a	And they are quite harmless and mild and interesting .
93	0	a	Alright .
94	0	a	Okay .
95	0	a	God , I still do not know what I am going to write about .
96	0	a	Superb sketch , by the way .
97	0	a	Tail is a bit big , I think .
98	0	a	I was going to choose a dog as well .
99	1	a	But I will just draw a different kind of dog .
100	0	a	Yep .
101	0	a	M my favourite animal is my own dog at home .
102	0	a	That does not really look like him , actually .
103	0	a	He looks more like a pig , actually .
104	0	a	well .
105	0	a	I see a dog in there .
106	0	a	Do you ?
107	0	a	Oh that is very good of you .
108	0	a	Yep .
109	0	a	Now I see a rooster .
110	0	a	What kind is it ?
111	0	a	Is he aware that th it is his own cha tail he is chasing ?
112	0	a	he is a mixture of various things .
113	0	a	and what do I like about him ,
114	0	a	That is just to suggest that his tail wags .
115	0	a	he is very friendly and cheery and always pleased to see you , and very kind of affectionate
116	0	a	and
117	0	a	and he is quite quite wee as well
118	0	a	so you know he can does not take up too much space .
119	0	a	and And he does a funny thing where he chases his tail as well ,
120	0	a	which is quite amusing , so
121	0	a	It is .
122	0	a	I think it is .
123	0	a	He only does it after he is had his dinner and he will just all of a sudden just get up and start chasing his tail around the living room .
124	0	a	It is an after dinner dog then .
125	0	a	Yeah ,
126	0	a	so
127	0	a	Yeah , maybe .
128	0	a	Probably when he was little he got lots of attention for doing it and has forever been conditioned .
129	0	a	Maybe .
130	0	a	Right , where did you find this ?
131	0	a	Just down here ?
132	0	a	Yeah .
133	0	a	Okay .
134	0	a	what are we doing next ? .
135	1	a	Okay , we now need to discuss the project finance .
136	0	a	so according to the brief we are going to be selling this remote control for twenty five Euro , and we are aiming to make fifty million Euro .
137	0	a	so we are going to be selling this on an international scale .
138	0	a	And we do not want it to cost any more than twelve fifty Euros , so fifty percent of the selling price .
139	0	a	Kay .
140	1	a	, can we just go over that again ?
141	0	a	, so bas at twel
142	0	a	Alright , yeah .
143	0	a	Sure .
144	0	a	Okay .
145	0	a	So cost like production cost is twelve fifty ,
146	0	a	but selling price is is that wholesale or retail ?
147	0	a	Like on the shelf .
148	0	a	All together .
149	0	a	I dunno .
150	0	a	I imagine
151	0	a	That is a good question .
152	0	a	Our sale our sale anyway .
153	0	a	I imagine it probably is our sale actually because it is probably up to the the the retailer to sell it for whatever price they want .
154	0	a	Yeah , okay okay .
155	0	a	Okay .
156	0	a	Alright .
157	0	a	But I I do not know ,
158	0	a	I mean do you think the fact that it is going to be sold internationally will have a bearing on how we design it at all ?
159	0	a	Think it will ?
160	0	a	Yes .
161	0	a	Well right away I am wondering if there is th th , like with DVD players , if there are zones .
162	0	a	Oh yeah , regions and stuff ,
163	0	a	yeah .
164	0	a	f frequencies or something as well as characters , different keypad styles and s symbols .
165	0	a	Yeah .
166	0	a	Okay .
167	0	a	Yeah .
168	0	a	Well for a remote control , do you think that will be
169	0	a	I suppose it is depends on how complicated our remote control is .
170	0	a	I do not know .
171	0	a	Yeah .
172	0	a	It does make sense from maybe the design point of view cause you have more complicated characters like European languages , then you need more buttons .
173	0	a	Yeah ,
174	0	a	yeah .
175	0	a	Yeah .
176	0	a	So , possibly .
177	0	a	Yeah .
178	0	a	Okay .
179	0	a	And then a and then al the other thing international is on top of the price .
180	0	a	I am thinking the price might might appeal to a certain market in one region , whereas in another it will be different , so
181	0	a	Just a chara just a characteristic of the Just
182	0	a	Or just like , basic product podi positioning , the twenty five Euro remote control might be a big hit in London , might not be such a big hit in Greece ,
183	0	a	who knows , something like that , yeah .
184	0	a	What , just like in terms of like the wealth of the country ?
185	0	a	Like how much money people have to spend on things like ?
186	0	a	Aye , I see what you mean , yeah .
187	0	a	Marketing .
188	0	a	Good marketing thoughts .
189	0	a	Yep .
190	0	a	Oh gosh ,
191	1	a	I should be writing all this down .
192	0	a	Right away I am making some kind of assumptions about what what information we are given here , thinking , kay trendy probably means something other than just basic , something other than just standard .
193	0	a	Yeah .
194	0	a	so I am wondering right away ,
195	0	a	is selling twenty five Euros , is that sort of the
196	0	a	thi is this going to to be like the premium product kind of thing or
197	0	a	Uh huh .
198	0	a	Yeah ,
199	0	a	yeah .
200	0	a	Like how much does , you know , a remote control cost .
201	0	a	Well twenty five Euro ,
202	0	a	I mean that is that is about like eighteen pounds or something ,
203	0	a	is not it ?
204	0	a	Or no ,
205	0	a	is it as much as that ?
206	0	a	Sixteen seventeen eighteen pounds .
207	0	a	Yep .
208	0	a	Yeah ,
209	0	a	I would say so ,
210	0	a	yeah .
211	0	a	, I dunno , I have never bought a remote control , so I do not know how how good a remote control that would get you .
212	0	a	No .
213	0	a	Yeah ,
214	0	a	yeah .
215	0	a	But yeah , I suppose it has to look kind of cool and gimmicky .
216	0	a	right
217	0	a	, okay .
218	1	a	Let me just scoot on ahead here .
219	0	a	Okay .
220	0	a	well d Does anybody have anything to add to to the finance issue at all ?
221	0	a	Thin
222	0	a	No , actually .
223	0	a	Do we have any other background information on like how that compares to other
224	0	a	other
225	0	a	Yeah .
226	0	a	That would be useful , though ,
227	0	a	would not it ,
228	0	a	if you knew like what your money would get you now .
229	0	a	Yeah , interesting thing about discussing production of a remote control for me is that l
230	0	a	as you point out ,
231	0	a	I just do not think of remote controls as somethin something people consciously assess in their purchasing habits .
232	0	a	Yeah ,
233	0	a	yeah .
234	0	a	It is just like getting shoelaces with shoes or something .
235	0	a	Oh .
236	0	a	It just comes along .
237	0	a	Five minutes to end of meeting .
238	0	a	Oh , okay .
239	0	a	We are a bit behind .
240	0	a	Do you know what I mean ?
241	0	a	Like so sort of like how do you
242	0	a	I
243	0	a	I mean one one way of looking at it would be , well the people producing television sets , maybe they have to buy remote controls .
244	0	a	Yeah .
245	0	a	Yeah .
246	0	a	Or another way is maybe people who have TV sets are really fed up with their remote control and they really want a better one or something .
247	0	a	I know
248	0	a	My parents went out and bought remote controls because they got fed up of having four or five different remote controls for each things the house .
249	0	a	But
250	0	a	Right .
251	0	a	Right .
252	0	a	So for them it was just how many devices control .
253	0	a	Okay so
254	0	a	Right ,
255	0	a	so in function one of the priorities might be to combine as many uses
256	0	a	I think so .
257	0	a	Yeah .
258	0	a	Right , so do you think that should be like a main design aim of our remote control d you know , do your your satellite and your regular telly and your VCR and everything ?
259	0	a	Yeah ,
260	0	a	yeah .
261	0	a	Yeah .
262	0	a	Well like ,
263	0	a	maybe what we could use is a sort of like a example of a successful other piece technology is palm palm pilots .
264	0	a	They are gone from being just like little sort of scribble boards to cameras , MP three players , telephones , everything , agenda .
265	0	a	So , like , I wonder if we might add something new to the to the remote control market , such as the lighting in your house , or
266	0	a	Yeah ,
267	0	a	yeah .
268	0	a	Yeah .
269	0	a	Or even like , you know , notes about what you want to watch .
270	0	a	Like you might put in there
271	0	a	oh I want to watch such and such and look a
272	0	a	Oh that is a good idea .
273	0	a	An
274	0	a	Yeah .
275	0	a	So extra functionalities .
276	0	a	Like , p personally for me , at home I have I have combined the the audio video of my television set and my DVD player and my CD player .
277	0	a	So they w all work actually function together but I have different remote controls for each of them .
278	0	a	So it is sort of ironic that that then they are in there
279	0	a	you know , the sound and everything it is just one system .
280	0	a	But each one is got its own little part .
281	0	a	okay ,
282	0	a	I would wel
283	0	a	we are going to have to wrap up pretty quickly in the next couple of minutes .
284	1	a	I will just check we have nothing else
285	0	a	Okay .
286	0	a	so anything else anybody wants to add about what they do not like about remote controls they have used ,
287	1	a	what they would really like to be part of this new one at all ?
288	0	a	You keep losing them .
289	0	a	And you keep losing them .
290	0	a	Okay .
291	0	a	Finding them is really a pain , you know .
292	0	a	I mean it is usually quite small , or when you want it right , it slipped behind the couch or it is kicked under the table .
293	0	a	Yeah .
294	0	a	Yeah .
295	0	a	W You get those ones where you can , if you like , whistle or make a really high pitched noise they beep .
296	0	a	Yeah .
297	0	a	You know .
298	0	a	That is just really good
299	0	a	id
300	0	a	Yep .
301	0	a	There
302	0	a	I mean is that something we would want to include , do you think ?
303	0	a	Dunno .
304	0	a	sure .
305	0	a	Okay maybe .
306	0	a	I remember when the first remote control my my family had was on a cable .
307	0	a	Actually had a cable between it and the TV and big like buttons that sort of like , like on a blender or something .
308	0	a	My goodness .
309	0	a	And , you know ,
310	0	a	when I think about what they are now , it is better , but actually it is still kind of ,
311	0	a	I dunno , like a massive junky thing on the table .
312	0	a	Still feels quite primitive .
313	1	a	Maybe we could think about how , could be more , you know , streamlined .
314	1	a	Maybe like a touch screen or something ?
315	0	a	Okay .
316	1	a	S
317	0	a	Something like that , yeah .
318	0	a	Or whatever would be technologically reasonable .
319	0	a	Uh huh , okay .
320	1	a	Well I guess that is up to our industrial designer .
321	0	a	Cause it could b it
322	0	a	could it could be that f
323	0	a	it could be that functionally that does not make it any better , but that just the appeal of of not having You know , these days there is a r pe things in people is homes are becoming more and more like chic , you know .
324	0	a	It looks better .
325	0	a	Yeah .
326	0	a	, nicer materials
327	1	a	and might be be worth exploring anyway .
328	0	a	Okay .
329	0	a	Okay .
330	0	a	Right , well
331	1	a	so just to wrap up
332	0	a	the next meeting is going to be in thirty minutes .
333	0	a	So that is about about ten to twelve by my watch .
334	0	a	so inbetween now and then , as the industrial designer , you are going to be working on you know the actual working design of it
335	0	a	so y
336	0	a	you know what you are doing there .
337	0	a	Yep .
338	0	a	for user interface , technical functions , I guess that is you know like what we have been talking about , what it will actually do .
339	0	a	and marketing executive , you will be just thinking about what it actually what , you know , what requirements it has to has to fulfil
340	0	a	and you will all get instructions emailed to you ,
341	0	a	I guess .
342	0	a	Okay .
343	0	a	Yeah , so it is th the functional design stage is next , I guess .
344	0	a	And
345	0	a	and that is the end of the meeting .
346	0	a	So I got that little message a lot sooner than I thought I would , so
347	1	a	Before we wrap up , just to make sure we are all on the same page here ,
348	0	a	, do we
349	0	a	We were given sort of an example of a coffee machine or something ,
350	0	a	right ?
351	0	a	Well ,
352	0	a	are we at ma right now on the assumption that our television remote control may have features which go beyond the television ?
353	0	a	Or are we keeping sort of like a a design commitment to television features ?
354	0	a	I I do not know .
355	0	a	Uh huh
356	0	a	, yeah .
357	0	a	Th
358	0	a	Okay ,
359	0	a	well just very quickly cause this we are supposed to finish now .
360	0	a	Yep .
361	0	a	I guess that is up to us ,
362	1	a	I mean you probably want some kind of unique selling point of it ,
363	0	a	so , you know
364	0	a	Yeah .
365	0	a	Yeah , sure .
366	0	a	Okay .
367	0	a	I think one factor would be production cost .
368	0	a	Okay , yeah .
369	0	a	Because there is a cap there , so depends on how much you can cram into that price .
370	0	a	Okay .
371	0	a	Okay .
372	0	a	Yeah .
373	0	a	I think that that is the main factor .
374	0	a	Okay .
375	0	a	Okay .
376	0	a	Right , okay , we will that is that is the end of the meeting , then .
377	0	a	So ,
378	0	a	 
379	0	a	Is that alright now ?
380	0	a	Okay .
381	0	a	Sorry ?
382	0	a	Okay , everybody all set to start the meeting ?
383	0	a	Okay , we have got half an hour for this one to discuss the functional design .
384	1	a	Could you plug me in ?
385	0	a	Okay .
386	0	a	Thanks .
387	0	a	All ready to go ?
388	0	a	Okay .
389	0	a	Okay .
390	0	a	so hopefully you have all been working away , and I have put the minutes of the last meeting in the project folder .
391	1	a	so I guess just to to recap on what we did last time .
392	0	a	kind of got to know each other a little bit and got familiar with all the equipment and started to discuss a bit about the project , you know , cost wise how much how much money we had to s just want to tell you that you have three new requirements , which is the The first one is that the company is decided that teletext is outdated because of how popular the internet is .
393	0	a	Nobody uses teletext very much anymore , so we do not really need to consider that in the functionality of the of the remote control .
394	0	a	Kay .
395	0	a	they have also suggested that we we only use the remote control to control the television , not the VCR , DVD or anything else .
396	0	a	I think the worry is that if the project becomes too complex then it will affect how long it takes us to get it into into production , the time to market .
397	0	a	Okay .
398	0	a	So , we are just going to keep it simple and it will just control the TV .
399	0	a	And the other thing was that the company want the corporate colour and slogan to be implemented in the new design .
400	0	a	I am not entirely sure what the corporate colour is .
401	0	a	It might be yellow , because there seems to be a lot of yellow everywhere .
402	0	a	And the slogan , like the actual written slogan , or just to embody the idea of the slogan ?
403	0	a	About putting the fashion in electronics .
404	0	a	Well that is the thing , I am I am not sure
405	0	a	th because on the the company website , what does it say
406	0	a	something
407	0	a	Yeah ,
408	0	a	I mean do they Is that something they want actually written on it ,
409	0	a	cause it is quite long .
410	0	a	yeah .
411	0	a	or yeah , just the idea , but I am not sure .
412	1	a	So that is something we can discuss as well .
413	0	a	So those are the three things , just not to worry about teletext , only control the TV , and and incorporate the colour and slogan of the company .
414	0	a	so is everybody okay with any of that
415	1	a	, or do you want me to recap at all ?
416	0	a	Right ,
417	0	a	time for presentations then .
418	0	a	Nope , we are all set .
419	1	a	Who would like to go first ?
420	0	a	Okay , cool .
421	1	a	I will go first .
422	0	a	Sure .
423	0	a	Alright ,
424	1	a	can I st steal this from the back of your laptop ?
425	0	a	so this is the technical functions design .
426	0	a	Oh yeah , of course
427	0	a	, yeah .
428	1	a	G go on ahead .
429	0	a	Right
430	0	a	to do the the design I have I have had a look online , I have had a look at the homepage , which has given us some insp inspiration from previous products .
431	0	a	I have had a look at the previous products to see what they offer
432	1	a	and I would like to ask you guys for your ideas about the design at the end of the meeting .
433	0	a	unfortunately we are not allowed to talk outside the meeting room , so
434	0	a	, having a look at the existing products , I found out that it tends to come in sort of two extremes , there is either a very complicated one that is got lots of buttons , lots of colours , very confusing , you do not know what you are doing .
435	0	a	Right .
436	0	a	Okay .
437	0	a	in that case the the labelling tends to be very bad .
438	1	a	there is an example I will show you at the end , sh show you now .
439	0	a	here the button there and there .
440	0	a	Alright .
441	0	a	This one is prog .
442	0	a	Sorry .
443	0	a	That one is perg and that one is prog , and it does not really tell you what it does .
444	0	a	, not sure if you had a a look at the other control in that example .
445	0	a	it is a very simple one .
446	0	a	It is got only the basic functions but it is the same size as the the hard to use one .
447	0	a	Oop .
448	0	a	it looked a bit clunky .
449	0	a	They are very big and not very much use for buttons .
450	0	a	and it is just very hard to access the advanced functions .
451	0	a	There is there is nothing for instance for a slow motion button .
452	0	a	, my own preferences , I prefer the the clunky one .
453	0	a	it is very easy to use .
454	0	a	but unfortunately it does lack the advanced functions
455	0	a	which I I quite like having on the controls .
456	1	a	so I believe the the advanced functions should maybe be hidden in a drawer , or something like tha from the bottom of it .
457	1	a	So , now I would like to ask for your preferences .
458	0	a	not sure of how long we have got , , the clunky one is the one on the right .
459	0	a	Well we can chat away for for five minutes
460	0	a	or so I think at at most .
461	0	a	Just a couple of minutes anyway .
462	0	a	M yeah , like a lot of a lot of what I have read and prepared for this meeting fits in really closely with what with what Craig is just gone over .
463	1	a	So in part I could I could give you some of my personal preferences but I could also th add some to this which is just about sort of sort of market research .
464	0	a	But anyway ,
465	1	a	we might come to that later .
466	0	a	Shall we sh
467	1	a	well we will stick to kind of your area for now .
468	0	a	Which which is the clunky one , the one on left or on the right?. .
469	0	a	Okay .
470	0	a	Yeah .
471	0	a	clunky in what sense , like h heavier ?
472	0	a	Larger ?
473	0	a	I see , so it is more just basic .
474	0	a	I think it is supposed to be the same size , but it is got much fewer buttons .
475	0	a	It is , you know , it is very spread out
476	0	a	and kind of you know
477	0	a	, I get the idea it would be sort of about this size .
478	0	a	Looks kind of
479	0	a	Yeah .
480	0	a	Right , okay .
481	0	a	Yeah .
482	0	a	got very few buttons on it and
483	1	a	, do we have any functions that we would want on it ?
484	0	a	I mean so far I have got on and off , switch the channel up and down , and put the volume up and down .
485	0	a	Yeah .
486	0	a	Sure .
487	0	a	Well I think it is a valid point .
488	0	a	I mean like the one on the left looks quite quite complicated , and that PRT p PROT thing is incredibly confusing .
489	0	a	so I see I see why yo you know you might prefer the simpler design , but yeah you do not want to lose out on , you know , what it does ,
490	0	a	so maybe you know
491	0	a	you know you get a lot of remote controls where you kind of flip the thing open ,
492	0	a	I think that is a good idea .
493	0	a	I think it is a good idea .
494	0	a	Uh huh .
495	0	a	they are just the the very basics you could use for a TV .
496	0	a	Uh huh ,
497	1	a	and then actual numbers for channels as well ,
498	1	a	yeah .
499	0	a	Okay .
500	0	a	, you say that is a h a required one or a requested one ?
501	0	a	Would you like
502	0	a	the channels like the the numbers on thing ,
503	0	a	, yeah .
504	0	a	Which was that ?
505	0	a	Up the numbers , or the up down ?
506	0	a	Yeah .
507	0	a	God , I wou
508	0	a	I would say that is required ,
509	0	a	I mean there is no way anybody is going to buy a remote control these days when if you ca not actually individually select channels ,
510	0	a	I mean would anybody disagree with that ?
511	0	a	, what else ,
512	0	a	So do not need to worry about teletext , do not need to worry about VCR ,
513	1	a	any kind of like display controls at all do you think we need to worry about ,
514	0	a	you know like brightness and contrast ?
515	0	a	Yeah .
516	0	a	We do not ?
517	0	a	No ?
518	0	a	Yeah .
519	0	a	Well I think I think es essentially what we are doing right now is we are categorising .
520	0	a	We are saying well we want this to be a product that offers all the sort of more tricky features
521	0	a	but we want them to be in another area ?
522	0	a	Is that right ?
523	0	a	Is that what we are we are doing ?
524	0	a	We are kind of like sorting them an
525	0	a	Or are we actually eliminating things
526	0	a	we just do not want the product to have ?
527	0	a	Yeah .
528	0	a	Yeah .
529	0	a	, to start with sort of a bit both ,
530	1	a	we need to find out exactly what we have to have and after that we can add things if they are possible .
531	0	a	I think are you are you maybe kind of thinking what we absolutely have to have and what would be nice ?
532	0	a	Okay , right .
533	1	a	Well , do you want to maybe just , at this point decide on what we absolutely must have as a p as a function of this .
534	0	a	Yep .
535	0	a	, so so far , just to recap you have got volume and channel control and
536	0	a	Right okay .
537	0	a	There is on and off , volume and channel , and skip to certain channels with the numbers .
538	0	a	yeah .
539	1	a	Well , one one way I would look at this would be that we a approach the different controls in terms of like control types ,
540	0	a	so that for the user it is very clear what they want to do where they go .
541	1	a	and also think maybe a little bit about sorta
542	1	a	w w
543	1	a	what would just want to be acc easily accessible .
544	0	a	For example if we had audio controls , those could be something people set up very rarely .
545	0	a	Oka .
546	1	a	Maybe they are un they are
547	1	a	they are
548	1	a	they are in a little area but covered up ,
549	0	a	things like channel and volume are used all the time ,
550	1	a	so we just have them right out on top , very just very sort of self explanatory .
551	1	a	so maybe we need to think about having three or more groupings of controls , you know like one which are just the the habitual ones that should be right within your natural grip .
552	1	a	And others that are also available and then others that are concealed .
553	0	a	Something like that .
554	0	a	Okay .
555	1	a	well , just to to wrap up quickly on this this little section
556	0	a	Have I just lost Oh no .
557	0	a	, do you think maybe that is the only kind of essential requirements ,
558	1	a	and then maybe just things that would be nice if it could do would be things like audio set up and display set up and things like that , maybe like a mute button ,
559	0	a	that sort of thing .
560	0	a	Yeah .
561	1	a	Any of you anything to add to that at all ?
562	0	a	No .
563	0	a	No .
564	1	a	I will add it later , I guess the presentation .
565	0	a	Okay , right .
566	0	a	Yeah .
567	0	a	okay ,
568	1	a	if we can move on to next presentation then please .
569	1	a	Sure .
570	0	a	Do you want to
571	0	a	Probably not , actually .
572	0	a	Do you want to switch places ?
573	1	a	Just just switch them .
574	0	a	Can this can this pl reach ?
575	0	a	Can this plug come across ?
576	0	a	No .
577	0	a	No .
578	0	a	No .
579	1	a	So why do not I just pick up and move then .
580	0	a	Yeah .
581	0	a	Here , I will just Why do not I just
582	1	a	er , can you go up behind me ?
583	0	a	Kinda This is so This
584	0	a	I am all in a knot now .
585	0	a	bit complicated .
586	0	a	It would be nice if everything was wireless , would not it ?
587	0	a	Right .
588	0	a	Okay .
589	1	a	So I can I can say already ,
590	0	a	I dunno whether this is for good or for bad
591	0	a	but there will be a lot of kind of redundancy in the in the the issues and the the the things .
592	0	a	Oh , like overlap between what you said ?
593	0	a	Oh well , for all you know that that will happen .
594	0	a	Yeah ,
595	0	a	yeah .
596	0	a	Which is ma not necessarily a bad thing ,
597	0	a	but may
598	0	a	what I have already started doing is cr
599	0	a	I created a slide in in my presentation here
600	0	a	so
601	0	a	so that we kind of think well what is the cumulative effect of what we have taken from your ideas and and mine , because certainly I I have a hard time separating separating things completely .
602	0	a	Obviously obviously what you have just told me what you have just told me impacts a lot on what like market research that that I have been
603	0	a	So how do I how do I get this up ?
604	0	a	Okay .
605	0	a	hard to know what where your role ends ,
606	0	a	yeah .
607	0	a	Okay .
608	0	a	function F eight .
609	0	a	pr yeah , press function and F eight ,
610	0	a	yeah .
611	0	a	Okay .
612	0	a	Alright .
613	0	a	So
614	0	a	F eight ?
615	0	a	Oh , and F eight .
616	0	a	Function , the blue button .
617	0	a	Next to the control on the left .
618	0	a	Yeah .
619	1	a	You have to push it together .
620	0	a	Okay .
621	0	a	Yep .
622	0	a	Okay , I think that that is doing it now .
623	0	a	Nope .
624	1	a	Try that again .
625	1	a	, again ?
626	0	a	Okay .
627	0	a	Think maybe the the wire in the back might be loose .
628	0	a	Wait .
629	0	a	Yeah , you want to
630	0	a	Oh oh here we go .
631	0	a	okay great .
632	0	a	Yep , there we go .
633	0	a	There you go .
634	0	a	Okay .
635	0	a	Just
636	0	a	Before I bring this up what I will just say is what I have what I have done is tried to collect some information so that I can then relay this to to you guys so that it is now becomes a collective thing .
637	0	a	And then kind of lead us in the direction of deciding ,
638	0	a	kay what what are our options
639	0	a	, what should we decide
640	0	a	and do you know what I mean , so .
641	1	a	Increase that cause we ca not see the
642	0	a	That is much better .
643	0	a	Okay .
644	0	a	Okay .
645	0	a	Right .
646	0	a	Can you
647	0	a	Right , okay .
648	0	a	There you go .
649	0	a	Okay .
650	0	a	Alright .
651	0	a	That would be
652	0	a	Okay .
653	0	a	So does that make sense ?
654	0	a	So what I basically got is I just looked into some information and sort of th tried to think about how how we could review it
655	0	a	and how we could
656	0	a	and what kind of decisions we could take away from it
657	1	a	and then maybe by the end of just looking at some of these things we can think about what are our priorities .
658	0	a	Cause certainly there is lots of different information to go through .
659	0	a	So I am thinking here about primarily about customer needs ,
660	1	a	that we start with the customer , and w you know , what they want and what are issues with with existing products .
661	1	a	to think about trends and also about try and connect that as you see with the company vision
662	0	a	which is about fashion in electronics .
663	1	a	and then , as I say w we would like to prioritise our design features from this
664	0	a	and Dunno .
665	0	a	Bouncing on top .
666	0	a	Okay .
667	0	a	Yeah .
668	0	a	So this is what I have found here , a lot of this is new to me ,
669	1	a	so we will just read through together .
670	0	a	, users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls .
671	0	a	So they find them ugly .
672	0	a	Most people find them ugly .
673	0	a	the vast majority would spend more money for it to look fancy as well , we will see later , the vast majority would spend more money for slightly more intuitive control , such as voice recognition .
674	0	a	Okay I am going to
675	1	a	we will look at that in a second .
676	0	a	most people use only a f a very slim portion of all the controls .
677	0	a	So I guess what we are looking at here is people want this h technology , they tend to use the most simple controls and overall
678	0	a	they find remote controls to be something they do not does not really appeal to them .
679	0	a	So I think what we are doing is we are trying to take like
680	0	a	if for me this is sorta like three different different inspirations , you know , one is that we want something that is high tech
681	0	a	but we want it to seem easy .
682	0	a	And in spite of the primitive side of it and the very high tech side , we want it to just be an appealing piece of equipment in people is hands .
683	0	a	frustrations .
684	0	a	They get lost a lot , s as it came up in our last meeting .
685	0	a	, takes time to learn how to use them .
686	0	a	This is why I mention when Craig was showing us some ideas that we actually try and group controls , so d it does not just look like a big panel , kind of like when you you look at , you know , a new computer keyboard , or something that is quite explanatory .
687	0	a	If you want audio , if you want visual , then you have those .
688	0	a	and I will admit I do not know what RSI stands for .
689	0	a	Repetitive strain injury .
690	0	a	Is installing a new remote control something that people
691	1	a	, I think it will be the mid range to the high end market , in terms of people .
692	0	a	, no , that did not come up at all .
693	0	a	so here here is another sort of a a review here of the main things .
694	0	a	I also found that most people would
695	0	a	adults at least would pay more for voice recognition .
696	0	a	Now apparently we do have access to all the tech cutting edge technology in remote control .
697	0	a	So I dunno
698	1	a	if that is possible we might consider getting into it .
699	0	a	And and again here as we sort of move m sort of thin start thinking about how we want to sell and market this
700	0	a	, I think a recurring theme here is the company wants it to be wants us to make something that is fashionable and sleek and trendy .
701	0	a	people additionally are not are not liking the appearance of their products ,
702	1	a	so we want to think about as we take all the sort of the techie features how we can put that into a unit which is which people like .
703	0	a	You know , they like the aesthetics and the ergonomics .
704	0	a	Okay .
705	0	a	So want something that looks good and is easy to use , big priorities .
706	0	a	Yeah .
707	0	a	Yeah ,
708	1	a	so you know just c looking at what what Craig Craig is i ideas are
709	1	a	s sorta
710	1	a	tell me that maybe what we want to do is try and separate the different things that we want to include in this .
711	0	a	Okay .
712	1	a	So if we do say well we want there to be all the technology will we try and make that almost be like optional technology .
713	0	a	You know , it is like like I find a lot of TVs these days ,
714	0	a	something really like about them is if you want to just turn them on and off you can , but they have little panels where you click and there is just like tons of features you go through .
715	0	a	So it you want to group all the different kind of types of functions together , you know .
716	0	a	Yeah .
717	0	a	That is
718	0	a	I think it is a good idea .
719	0	a	Yeah .
720	0	a	That is s that is sort of the
721	0	a	But I
722	0	a	I am
723	1	a	my hope here is that I am putting out this information so that we can then say okay , well how do we collectively move on with it .
724	0	a	I I have not brought out one specific marketing idea ,
725	1	a	although my sense is that what we should try and think about is what are the current trends in materials and shapes and styles , and then use that .
726	0	a	Okay .
727	1	a	But not let that confine us technologically .
728	0	a	Okay .
729	0	a	So
730	0	a	Alright ?
731	0	a	Any comments on all of that ?
732	0	a	That is
733	0	a	Yeah .
734	0	a	Right .
735	1	a	Well , one of the things that we have to decide on by the end of the meeting is who we are going to be who is our our target audience , our target market .
736	1	a	, so if we want something that that looks good and is easy to use , but has y is fairly powerful product , whatever , who do we really want to aim that at ?
737	0	a	I mean
738	0	a	Yeah , who wou who would have the money to spend .
739	0	a	Okay .
740	1	a	Where is the money , maybe .
741	0	a	Yeah .
742	0	a	Well i if if like twenty five Euro is our is our selling price then you can imagine ,
743	0	a	well I do not
744	0	a	I am not really sure how much that will retail at .
745	0	a	And who watches TV .
746	0	a	But you want
747	0	a	it is somebody who is not going to just use the remote that comes with their telly , I suppose , they are going to actually go out and buy one .
748	0	a	Yeah .
749	1	a	So , who do you think we are aiming this at ?
750	0	a	It is about sixteen , seventeen pounds , I think .
751	0	a	Cause twenty five Euros for a remote , how much is that lo locally in pounds ?
752	0	a	Is that too
753	0	a	is that a lot of money to buy an extra remote or a replacement remote ?
754	0	a	Right .
755	0	a	Yeah ,
756	0	a	okay .
757	1	a	so maybe not the high end range , but maybe middle , middle up ish .
758	0	a	Okay .
759	0	a	Kind of .
760	0	a	You know how much ?
761	0	a	I dunno
762	0	a	I guess you pay , what , ten ten quid for a remote ?
763	0	a	Like a simple replacement , right .
764	0	a	Okay .
765	0	a	Yeah .
766	0	a	I mean if you lost your remote and the first thing you just want to go out and get ,
767	0	a	would you
768	0	a	how much would you pay ?
769	0	a	Yeah .
770	0	a	Yeah ,
771	0	a	yeah .
772	0	a	Yeah .
773	0	a	This this kind of touches on your comments there , David .
774	0	a	These are the age groups which we have information on
775	0	a	and these are
776	0	a	this is a table of h what people would pay more for a certain feature .
777	0	a	Just gives us a rough idea of where the w the will to spend money on TV equipment is .
778	0	a	Okay Okay .
779	0	a	Mostly focused around the twenty five age group .
780	0	a	Yeah ,
781	1	a	so do you think we are we are aiming at a fairly young market then ?
782	0	a	Yeah , okay .
783	1	a	Yep .
784	0	a	Sort of young professional , kind of .
785	0	a	, yeah , it is the
786	0	a	Yep .
787	0	a	Well , did you not say it was the the adults that were going for the the voice recognition ?
788	0	a	Sort of the the older group .
789	1	a	do you think then voice recognition is something we should really seriously consider ?
790	1	a	What what do you think , Craig ?
791	0	a	N
792	0	a	yeah .
793	0	a	f
794	0	a	Yeah .
795	0	a	It does it does fit with the market that we are sort of identifying ,
796	0	a	in terms of
797	0	a	Okay .
798	1	a	I think we are going to have to narrow it down , to say let is target these people and give them what they want
799	0	a	and cause you know , there needs to be some kind of selling point to it .
800	0	a	Yeah .
801	0	a	Sure .
802	0	a	Sure .
803	0	a	Yeah .
804	1	a	So anybody anything there to add
805	0	a	Just kind of young professionals ,
806	0	a	th like
807	0	a	if we are going to include speech recognition , it is kind of between fifteen and thirty five seems to be like a really high response to that .
808	1	a	So we could say that was our target .
809	0	a	I
810	0	a	I think twenty five to thirty five is is is fair to add that in as a group as well
811	0	a	because that is more than half your group of people who are willing to at least try and use your technology .
812	0	a	Yeah .
813	0	a	Yeah .
814	0	a	Yeah ,
815	0	a	yeah .
816	0	a	Okay , so fifteen to thirty five , look fairly young .
817	0	a	Yeah .
818	0	a	Yeah .
819	0	a	You know , they have bit of expendable income to spend on this sort of thing .
820	0	a	I think perhaps that age group is significant as well because those are people who use the computer , who are familiar with their with computers in in their everyday work .
821	0	a	Yeah .
822	0	a	I think people who are maybe about I would not say thirty five , but people who are about forty ish and above now would not be so dependent and reliant on a computer or a mobile phone or something like that .
823	0	a	But
824	0	a	yeah .
825	0	a	Yeah .
826	0	a	Yeah , sure .
827	0	a	So
828	0	a	Yeah .
829	0	a	So these are people who are gadgety , right ?
830	0	a	People who are u growing up used to , you know in schools and in universities ,
831	0	a	when you go on to their working lives , people who would you know regular
832	0	a	Yeah .
833	0	a	Yeah .
834	0	a	So they will not sh not shy away from something quite high tech .
835	0	a	Yeah .
836	0	a	Yeah .
837	0	a	That that is that is a good point .
838	0	a	okay , so
839	1	a	so shall we make the decision to include speech recognition
840	0	a	if we can .
841	0	a	If we can .
842	0	a	I
843	0	a	I think one thing we should try not to avoid is not to say we have to use speech recognition right now ,
844	0	a	because , based on what you have go y everybody is saying , right , you want something simple .
845	0	a	Yeah .
846	0	a	Okay .
847	0	a	Why is that ?
848	0	a	Okay .
849	0	a	You want basic stuff and you want something that is easy to use .
850	0	a	Speech recognition might not be the simplest thing for somebody to use .
851	0	a	Right .
852	1	a	Could it be an on off thing ?
853	0	a	Like if you want it on
854	0	a	Yeah .
855	0	a	but what I am saying is that we are we are trying to lock ourselves into a s particular kind of technology , rather than focusing on on exactly what are the features that we are going to say , and then , you know , say speech recognition is good for this , speech recognition is not good for this .
856	0	a	Where you can activate it and deactivate it ?
857	0	a	Yeah .
858	0	a	Yeah .
859	0	a	Yeah .
860	0	a	Okay .
861	0	a	Sure .
862	0	a	Sure .
863	0	a	So maybe we should
864	1	a	I suggest that we think about speech recognition ,
865	0	a	anyway it is a
866	0	a	it is something that can be used to fulfil a function , but at end of the day we do not look at the technology , but we look at the function first .
867	0	a	Okay .
868	0	a	Yeah .
869	0	a	Sure .
870	0	a	Uh huh .
871	0	a	Yeah .
872	0	a	Okay .
873	0	a	Sure .
874	0	a	Yep .
875	0	a	okay ,
876	1	a	well do you want to give us your presentation
877	0	a	and then then we can I do not know
878	0	a	might have been a good idea to all deliver our presentations and then discuss ,
879	0	a	but this is this is how we are
880	0	a	Yeah , exactly
881	0	a	, yeah .
882	1	a	Okay , sure .
883	0	a	Yep .
884	0	a	Yeah , it is good
885	0	a	well it is good to get ideas out while they are fresh in mind .
886	0	a	Not
887	0	a	Yeah .
888	0	a	Oh it is something that is just occurred to me as well is if we make it speech reco if we incorporate speech recognition
889	0	a	, that is appealing to people maybe with a physical disability as well .
890	0	a	And not losing .
891	0	a	And also it helps in terms of people not losing this , you know
892	0	a	they
893	0	a	they are saying
894	0	a	oh it is
895	0	a	I lose it in the couch .
896	0	a	Yeah .
897	0	a	Yeah .
898	0	a	like we are kind of what we are b sort of getting in into here
899	0	a	is mating different design features together
900	0	a	that they
901	0	a	Right .
902	0	a	I reckon one problem with speech recognition is
903	0	a	I have actually seen one of them used
904	0	a	and the technology that was in that one was not particularly amazing ,
905	0	a	so you end up yelling at the control for hours .
906	0	a	Really ?
907	0	a	Do you think maybe we need like further advances in that kind of area until it is worthwhile incorporating it though ?
908	0	a	Channel up .
909	0	a	Oh really , you have seen one before .
910	0	a	I think it would probably quite expensive to put in .
911	0	a	Sorry ,
912	1	a	do you mind passing me my notepad .
913	0	a	Course not .
914	0	a	Thanks .
915	0	a	Cool ,
916	0	a	There you go .
917	0	a	Okay .
918	0	a	Right .
919	0	a	Well this is just the working design .
920	0	a	Well this is just what how I would go about it .
921	0	a	I guess I try to define like what we are doing now , try to define what we are trying to get done .
922	0	a	I think in a practical way , we kind of know what it is .
923	0	a	Right .
924	0	a	We have used it , we are familiar with it , but we are we ca not
925	0	a	n we have not narrowed down exactly what the things we are trying to fulfil , like Besides the basics
926	0	a	, I think back in the back of our minds we know what the basics are .
927	0	a	Has to change channels , has to change volume , but in like specifics , right , which one of the basics are you trying to target .
928	0	a	are there certain parts of the basics that are more important or less important than the basics ?
929	0	a	and I just
930	0	a	the idea is just to get everybody to
931	0	a	I usually have a have have a design that is there as a basic , so , you know , things that to start everything going .
932	0	a	But I guess everybody does have some idea ,
933	0	a	so I do not think there is a need for that .
934	0	a	okay this finding things is a little bit confusing ,
935	1	a	so I will go into the diagram first .
936	0	a	It just explains how the process goes through ,
937	0	a	from a
938	0	a	from the basic technology point of view , the basic steps that you need
939	0	a	in the diagram and in this slide probably works better .
940	0	a	okay ,
941	0	a	you need some power source .
942	0	a	Kay , a battery or something , to keep it going .
943	0	a	and that power source is important because it ties you down to how long the device will last .
944	0	a	Uh huh .
945	0	a	it ties you down perhaps a bit later on in terms of the technologies how far you can transmit the signal or the complexity of the functions that you want .
946	0	a	Like for example , voice recognition , right .
947	0	a	That might be constrained because that you might need to power a microphone , you might need to power other things , so that is one perhaps constraint there .
948	0	a	Th Okay , the basic thing is there is a user interface where people punch a button or talk into it or smile to it or blink their eyes , whatever .
949	0	a	You know , and that picks up an input from a user ,
950	0	a	a logic
951	0	a	a series of logic has to decide what the user is telling the device , and the device has to r you know , based on you push button A , so I will do something with button A .
952	0	a	So maybe button A is the power button , okay .
953	0	a	and then it needs to be able to send the signal out to the device itself which is the receiver here .
954	0	a	and I think that is about it in terms of my design .
955	0	a	It is fairly general , and I guess the purpose of this is also not to restrict you in in the way you are thinking , like voice recognition , right ,
956	1	a	if it is something which is important then we just add more power rather than having a thing that we do not have enough power .
957	0	a	So it is not really a constraint in that sense ,
958	0	a	but I mean these are functionally , you know , the base , what the technology has to do .
959	0	a	Okay .
960	0	a	Okay .
961	0	a	Okay .
962	0	a	so I guess the rest of it
963	0	a	I think we should
964	1	a	maybe you you want to go back to what the functions are ?
965	0	a	I think that is more relevant to a discussion ?
966	0	a	Yeah , w I am done .
967	0	a	Kay .
968	1	a	Well , do you wan do you want to finish up your your whole presentation then ?
969	0	a	Are you are you all done ?
970	0	a	Sure .
971	0	a	Sure .
972	0	a	More or less .
973	0	a	Yeah .
974	0	a	Ps Oh , it is just putting the rest of it into words , but it is essentially the same thing .
975	0	a	Yep .
976	0	a	you have a transmitter , an input device , logic chip , you know , stuff like that .
977	0	a	Okay .
978	0	a	Okay .
979	0	a	Right .
980	0	a	I guess this would be
981	0	a	Yep .
982	0	a	Right .
983	0	a	And like on the means b
984	0	a	Since we are on the topic of the technology , are there any like what are our options ?
985	0	a	Alright , what is what i in
986	0	a	Is this the only way that we go about it , or are there other thin
987	0	a	Right .
988	0	a	, these these are not technology options in that sense .
989	0	a	This is just a basic principles and basic components that are needed .
990	0	a	The basic principle of
991	0	a	Kay .
992	0	a	Okay .
993	0	a	Right .
994	0	a	For example , if you needed if you needed to add a voice recognition , right , then your user interface would be split , broken down into more components , right , which you have a microphone , the VR and stuff like that .
995	0	a	Okay .
996	0	a	Oh .
997	0	a	Okay .
998	0	a	So this just show how we are kind of modularising the whole thing .
999	0	a	Yep .
1000	0	a	Okay .
1001	0	a	Yep .
1002	0	a	So each component represents one function , but I think the basic functions are the logic , the transmitter , and the receiver , okay , and the power are things that you wo not have to care about .
1003	0	a	Yeah .
1004	1	a	and those are things that based on what your user interface requires then we will add more functionality to it .
1005	0	a	Okay .
1006	0	a	there might be one other consideration which would be
1007	0	a	that the the transmission between the remote control and the TV for example .
1008	0	a	Okay .
1009	1	a	Okay , are we going to restrict ourselves to using the traditional technologies of infra red thing ?
1010	0	a	Because that is something you need to actually be physically be pointing to .
1011	0	a	Okay .
1012	0	a	Okay .
1013	0	a	Okay .
1014	0	a	Right .
1015	0	a	Right .
1016	0	a	Well well a worry that was was expressed in the new requirements was that if we made this too complex it would e it would effect how long how long it took us to get this to market ,
1017	1	a	so I th suspect it might be a good idea just to restrict our kind of our creative influence on this on the user interface and not worry so much about how we transmit it
1018	0	a	because I mean it it is tried and tested intra red ,
1019	1	a	so we could stay with tha
1020	0	a	Oh , yeah .
1021	0	a	Yep .
1022	0	a	There might be one other problem with the transmission , in particular right now , since we are talking about voice recognition .
1023	0	a	if somebody is going to h talk to the device , you ideally want them to hold it to them .
1024	0	a	I it
1025	0	a	you may not require that ,
1026	0	a	but you know , it is it is
1027	0	a	it is something very natural , I guess , you know , to hold it , to signal to the user , and push a button maybe to start s talking about it .
1028	0	a	Right .
1029	0	a	Right .
1030	0	a	Yeah , .
1031	0	a	Okay .
1032	0	a	Then you need to send the signal out , so because if you are using infra red , the line of sight say the TV is at that chair , and I am standing in front of here and the transmitter is here , it blocks it .
1033	0	a	Yeah .
1034	0	a	Okay .
1035	0	a	So in that sense , there is not really a restriction
1036	0	a	but it is something which you may have to think about later on in the process .
1037	0	a	Right .
1038	0	a	Okay .
1039	0	a	Not so much further down .
1040	0	a	Okay .
1041	0	a	And just a clarification before we finish this .
1042	0	a	does c is our controller is it have the option of being on a standard frequency as all of the other equipment , so that the one controller can control several pieces of equipment ?
1043	0	a	Okay .
1044	0	a	There is there is not much specific specific information , but I think that one indication of infra red mean that you are just targeting traditional devices .
1045	0	a	W
1046	0	a	Yeah .
1047	0	a	Because infra red is something which everybody has .
1048	0	a	W
1049	0	a	Well well we have
1050	0	a	In the new requirement spec they said just to focus on the TV ,
1051	1	a	so that is what we should do for now I think .
1052	0	a	Just to TV , okay .
1053	0	a	Okay .
1054	0	a	Something I was wondering about was the power .
1055	1	a	, is it worth considering like having like a charging unit as opposed to just regular batteries ?
1056	0	a	I mean is that something we really want to go into , do you think , or should we just consider running on regular batteries ?
1057	0	a	Uh huh .
1058	0	a	There is a there is
1059	0	a	Okay , from from a from a component point of view there is added complexity , and you add cost to it , and then there is probably the fact that you need another physical component .
1060	0	a	Uh huh .
1061	0	a	You need a docking cradle , for example , for you to put it in to charge .
1062	0	a	Yeah .
1063	0	a	Okay .
1064	0	a	Or you need to get the user to plug it in .
1065	0	a	and most users are very f use already used to the idea of buying batteries and putting it into the controller .
1066	0	a	Okay ,
1067	0	a	so
1068	0	a	Yeah .
1069	0	a	But unless the controller is going to consume a lot of batteries , like he is going to run through like twenty batteries a month , then I do not think rechargeable is something we should you know , we really need to care about .
1070	0	a	Yeah .
1071	0	a	Yeah .
1072	0	a	Okay , so just stick to to regular
1073	0	a	Okay .
1074	0	a	, right .
1075	0	a	So basically the
1076	1	a	I am just going to just recap what I said at the start ,
1077	0	a	was that the the whole point of this meeting was to f absolutely finalise who we are going to aim this at , and what exactly the product is going to do .
1078	0	a	Okay .
1079	0	a	Okay .
1080	1	a	So just to recap on
1081	0	a	Are we all happy about the idea of aiming the product at the fifteen to thirty five bracket ?
1082	0	a	and also the funct the the actual functions of what it is going to do .
1083	0	a	Yeah , that is good .
1084	1	a	Do you want to recap on that , Craig ?
1085	0	a	Okay , right .
1086	0	a	I think we just say that it was going to be the the most basic stuff possible .
1087	0	a	on off , up and down channels , up and down volume and skip to a channel .
1088	0	a	Ta .
1089	1	a	And is it going to include any of the the more advanced features , or are we going to eliminate those ?
1090	0	a	Okay .
1091	1	a	I think we include mute , but apart from that I think we just we will go for the simpleness .
1092	0	a	Okay .
1093	0	a	Okay , I think
1094	0	a	Another thing that you were saying about categorising the controls ?
1095	1	a	maybe I could suggest we
1096	1	a	we break them down into three simple categories .
1097	0	a	R is it is it is it s
1098	1	a	is it not an option still that we include some things just as a sort of under like sort of under a door or some
1099	0	a	Cause what what I am I would be a bit worried about is if someone was h had previously developed habits of expecting to control surround sound or this and that with their controller and then and then they , you know , w they get ours and w it is does not have that .
1100	0	a	Yeah , it is as optional functions .
1101	0	a	Yeah .
1102	0	a	I dunno if that would be a problem .
1103	0	a	Okay .
1104	0	a	Yeah .
1105	0	a	Okay .
1106	1	a	One would be audio controls , one would be video controls , and the other one would be a device .
1107	0	a	Okay .
1108	0	a	this may not map very well to advanced functionality especially , but I think that from a manufacturer is point of view , from a person designing the device , but I think from a point of view of a person using the device , you know a TV is something they see and something they hear , it is something they do other things to like turn it on and turn it off .
1109	0	a	Yeah .
1110	0	a	Yeah .
1111	1	a	I mean like so what we could have is like three buckets , right , where we could throw things into , like if we want this feature , let is throw it into there , and then from there decide whether it is basic , or it is non basic .
1112	0	a	Right .
1113	0	a	Yeah .
1114	0	a	Kay , okay .
1115	0	a	I mean it might help with the visualisation .
1116	0	a	Like that .
1117	0	a	Okay .
1118	0	a	And it would actually help with the component build as well .
1119	0	a	Okay , right .
1120	0	a	okay , great .
1121	0	a	, okay well
1122	0	a	I gotta kind of got five minutes to wrap up now .
1123	0	a	next thing we are doing is having lunch .
1124	0	a	Whoohoo .
1125	0	a	and then we are going to have thirty minutes of working on the next stage .
1126	1	a	so I will be putting the minutes of this this meeting into the project documents folder .
1127	1	a	so I guess just to just to confirm that we know what we are doing in the next well in the thirty minutes after lunch anyway ,
1128	0	a	for our Industrial Designer , you are going to be thinking about the components concept .
1129	0	a	User Interface Designer going to be thinking about our user interface , and marketing you are going to be thinking about trend watching .
1130	0	a	and you will all get specific instructions as well .
1131	0	a	So I dunno ,
1132	1	a	just just to to ask now if you have got anything else you have thought about while we have been talking .
1133	1	a	, do you want to start with David .
1134	1	a	Anything else to say at all ?
1135	0	a	No , okay .
1136	0	a	no , not really .
1137	1	a	yeah ,
1138	1	a	just I just wanted to ask then before we wrap up ,
1139	1	a	shall we agree for sake of sort of clarity and when we when we r resume that we will u use this idea David is proposed , where we think of these three sort of buckets and anything anything we discuss about them is sort of , okay , we are talking about this .
1140	1	a	Andrew ?
1141	0	a	Yeah ,
1142	0	a	yeah
1143	0	a	I think that is definitely a good idea .
1144	0	a	Uh huh .
1145	1	a	Shall we do that , then ?
1146	0	a	Okay , great .
1147	0	a	Yeah .
1148	0	a	things like on off .
1149	0	a	Because they do not have anything to do with what you see .
1150	0	a	Yeah .
1151	0	a	I me mean in terms of picture and the entertainment value ,
1152	0	a	you know , so
1153	0	a	And channel .
1154	0	a	Okay .
1155	0	a	And and channel .
1156	0	a	Right .
1157	0	a	Because the on off also goes , you know , like on off like power , not on off sound .
1158	0	a	Not on off video .
1159	0	a	Yeah .
1160	0	a	Although you do not turn off the video on your TV , but you might want to you know turn off the sound , say you want to pick up the phone ,
1161	0	a	there is a mute button , right ,
1162	0	a	so you you have you have a choice of putting it on to others or a device .
1163	0	a	Okay .
1164	0	a	Okay .
1165	0	a	Device is basically anything which we ca not categorise , right .
1166	0	a	Okay ,
1167	0	a	so you are going to have audio which is going to be like you know your bass settings and actual volume hi
1168	0	a	Okay .
1169	0	a	We put it out .
1170	0	a	Yeah ,
1171	0	a	anything to do with what you hear , right .
1172	0	a	You you put that into audio .
1173	0	a	Okay , and then visual
1174	0	a	Okay , so brightness , contrast , things like that ,
1175	0	a	and then just actual device things , like what channel you are watching , turning on an off , stuff like that .
1176	0	a	And then video is anything that you can see .
1177	0	a	Yep .
1178	0	a	Colour ,
1179	0	a	yeah .
1180	0	a	Yep .
1181	0	a	Sure .
1182	0	a	Sure .
1183	0	a	Yep .
1184	0	a	Okay .
1185	0	a	Okay ,
1186	0	a	And then k I suppose quite likely what would happen is in
1187	0	a	the
1188	0	a	d device category
1189	0	a	there might be some which are just like the habitual standard and then others which are maybe a bit more
1190	0	a	Yeah .
1191	0	a	Like random which we have no other place to put , but we need it somewhere there .
1192	0	a	Yeah .
1193	0	a	Sure , okay .
1194	0	a	Okay .
1195	0	a	Okay .
1196	0	a	even even if it does not map very clearly what happens is that people at least have some in their mind .
1197	0	a	It is easy to use , I think
1198	0	a	that is one thing that
1199	0	a	Okay .
1200	0	a	Okay .
1201	0	a	Okay .
1202	1	a	so yeah , I guess just things to think about are you know like the fact it is gotta look good ,
1203	0	a	because of who we are we are , you know , targeting this at .
1204	1	a	something maybe kind of quirky in design maybe .
1205	1	a	Make it kind of ergonomic kind of to hold ,
1206	0	a	you know , things like that .
1207	0	a	so I guess I guess that is it .
1208	0	a	Great .
1209	0	a	That is the meeting over .
1210	0	a	 
1211	1	a	Is to do now is to decide how to fulfil what your stuff is ,
1212	0	a	so in that sense
1213	0	a	so it does kind of make sense , yeah .
1214	0	a	Yeah .
1215	0	a	Okay .
1216	0	a	Yeah , sure .
1217	0	a	Okay , well
1218	0	a	Okay .
1219	0	a	It kind of does make sense , does not it ,
1220	0	a	because when we get into the end of meeting we are kind of talking about action and design as opposed to background .
1221	0	a	Yep .
1222	0	a	Everything I have is kind of background .
1223	1	a	Okay we all ready to go ?
1224	0	a	Well how on the in this meeting then if we
1225	1	a	I will just just recap on the minutes from the last meeting .
1226	0	a	Yep .
1227	0	a	And we decided on decided on our our target group being fifteen to thirty five , and we decided that it was going to be non rechargeable battery powered , that we are going to group our audio visual and other functions into into those categories , .
1228	0	a	Yep .
1229	0	a	And I told you guys about the three new requirements about ignoring teletext , ignoring everything except the TV , and trying to incorporate the the corporate colour and slogan .
1230	0	a	so that was the last meeting .
1231	0	a	Is there anything
1232	0	a	have I forgotten anything ?
1233	0	a	Is that everything ?
1234	0	a	Okay .
1235	0	a	No .
1236	0	a	that sounds .
1237	1	a	so if we have the three presentations , and then if you have anything to kind of that
1238	1	a	you know you are going to want to discuss , maybe just make a note of it , and we will have all the discussion at the end .
1239	0	a	That might be a better idea this time .
1240	0	a	Sure .
1241	1	a	And so if we start off with Andrew and then Craig and then David ,
1242	0	a	if that is alright .
1243	0	a	Okay .
1244	0	a	Sure .
1245	1	a	and then after that we will have to make some decisions about stuff , right .
1246	0	a	Yep .
1247	0	a	Yeah , cool .
1248	1	a	So if you want to take this .
1249	1	a	Why do not I get that ?
1250	0	a	Screwed in quite tightly .
1251	0	a	what did
1252	0	a	how did we leave it with speech recognition now ?
1253	0	a	We did we say we were going to try maybe incorporate it
1254	0	a	but we had not made a definite decision on that ?
1255	0	a	Right .
1256	0	a	Oh I should also point out that the you know the kind of final objective of this meeting is to reach a decision on the concepts of the product .
1257	0	a	Okay .
1258	0	a	So that is kind of the end result hopefully .
1259	0	a	Okay .
1260	0	a	alright so c
1261	0	a	is it function F eight ?
1262	0	a	Uh huh .
1263	0	a	Hopefully appear in a wee second .
1264	0	a	Come on .
1265	0	a	I think it is working .
1266	0	a	Up there we go .
1267	0	a	Okay great s
1268	0	a	so
1269	1	a	let me just start this .
1270	0	a	Okay great .
1271	0	a	So s move on .
1272	0	a	Uh huh oh where would it all go ?
1273	0	a	It is not good .
1274	0	a	Oh no .
1275	1	a	Okay lemme just see where I can find it .
1276	0	a	This looks more like it .
1277	0	a	I think I just opened up the template .
1278	0	a	Sorry about that .
1279	0	a	Oh right .
1280	0	a	Okay alright
1281	0	a	so let is have a look here .
1282	0	a	Okay so this was the method that I have taken .
1283	0	a	Here we go .
1284	1	a	basically what I want to do here , before we get into it too far , is I want to show you all the background information I have that I think we need to acknowledge if we want this to be successful .
1285	0	a	Okay .
1286	1	a	And and then sorta g go through some of the way that I have dealt with that information , and then sort of bring us all together into it to see sorta see how this fits in with the overall vision .
1287	0	a	so I have tried to take a whole lot of market research and summarise it for us , and then ide identify trends that are are sort of in sync and are important to our our p project plan that we have so far , and then initiate a kind of discussion on design options so that it sorta helps us to to narrow in on on aspects that will inform other other elements of the of the project .
1288	0	a	Does that make sense , tha that sort of strategy ?
1289	0	a	I thought that that will impact on the rest of what we do , so that is why I suggested we get in this .
1290	0	a	Yep .
1291	0	a	Aye a fair point definitely .
1292	0	a	Okay so out of different figures and ratings ob of people in general , consumers in general , the number one thing that was found was that the br t television remote control , a fancy look and feel , okay , and not , it specified , not a functional look or or feel , b f f fancy .
1293	0	a	Okay .
1294	1	a	however , this is where we kind of have to be very , I think , creative about it .
1295	0	a	Number two was that it be innovative .
1296	0	a	Okay so that tells me that we have to find a way to be innovative without a adding just unnecessary sort of functional bits to it .
1297	0	a	and third priority for ease of use , so again that kind of gives us a general picture of how it has to be , quite user friendly while still having technology .
1298	1	a	So it I will just say right away as a bit of a foreshadowing into how we proceed with this in terms of m marketing ,
1299	1	a	is that I think what we should think about is how the about how the innovation contributes to the look and feel , and not so much to the functionality of it .
1300	1	a	For example like when you pick it up and push it like it all lights up or something , you know what I mean , like , or it is got something else to it that just seems innovative
1301	0	a	because obviously the thing that
1302	0	a	the message here is ease of use .
1303	0	a	Aye right .
1304	0	a	Uh huh .
1305	0	a	So how do you make innovation make something more more easy to use ?
1306	1	a	Well that is
1307	1	a	I guess where we are going to go with this .
1308	0	a	Okay .
1309	0	a	Okay then there is the other aspect of the back the the market research I have here is on fashion style , okay , which as we have agreed is a priority .
1310	0	a	top European fashion trend that I read about says there is this emerging theme of fruit and vegetables , okay , especially in clothes and furniture .
1311	0	a	And when I first saw that I thought , well do we want to actually try and think about this trend and how we add something to it , or we get right into it , or we completely steer away from it ,
1312	0	a	do you know what I mean ?
1313	1	a	So my my feeling is that we w do want to observe this trend , but we want to think also about the fact that it sort of has to fit in with something which is not specifically electronics .
1314	0	a	Okay okay .
1315	0	a	cause I think what we are in
1316	0	a	what we are in is partly sort of home decor ,
1317	0	a	partly something like a computer , so
1318	0	a	I think we might want to be careful about how you know how quickly we create like a remote control in the shape of an apple or something ,
1319	0	a	I think that would be pushing it .
1320	0	a	And then in terms of m material trends are for things to be soft and spongy and sort of , you might say ergonomic or or friendly to handle , which is which also in indicated that last year this was this was not the case .
1321	0	a	So probably a lot of the competition on the market will be still in last year is mode ,
1322	1	a	so if we try and really capitalise on that , I think that will be in our favour .
1323	0	a	So these this is the summary of everything .
1324	0	a	style is number one thing in the in the market of who we are selling to .
1325	0	a	innovative design technology is also a must in that it is seen it would be seen to be cutting edge , but ease of use t has to be insured throughout .
1326	0	a	That was like the number three thing .
1327	0	a	And then at the end there are vibrant natural colours that is the way I interpreted it anyway , softness in materials , shape , and function , and so I have written at written at the bottom to give us sort of a context of discussion , Mac iPods , something which is , I would have to say very high tech , ten gigabytes , whatever , but when you hold it in your hand there is like no buttons .
1328	0	a	You know what a Mac iPod is ?
1329	0	a	I am thinking however Mac iPod is sort of last year is because it is very hard and sort of glassy and glossy ,
1330	1	a	so I am thinking if we imagine that we are taking some of the features of a Mac iPod
1331	1	a	and we are then making it s more of like a more of like a comfortable type of
1332	0	a	or more of like a
1333	0	a	maybe more vibrant to friendly thing to have .
1334	0	a	that is true , yeah .
1335	0	a	and then so this is
1336	1	a	w with all that information what I am what I am suggesting in this slide here is that we we take these ideas , and as we get into more the more techni like sort of production side of things , that we think about shape , materials , and themes or series that go throughout .
1337	0	a	Sort of like a
1338	0	a	I dunno like
1339	1	a	we think of some kind of a thin theme that unifies it all , that we agree on , sorta like a marketing identity .
1340	0	a	Does that make sense ?
1341	0	a	Yeah .
1342	0	a	So so like I threw out a few ideas there just to kind of get us thinking along those lines like lemon , lime , I dunno , green colours , pe whatever , it is just an idea , cause I am thinking that some of these ideas will seem quite coherent if we use them in terms of their what people associate this them with in terms of texture , shape , colours , things like that .
1343	0	a	kay .
1344	0	a	Great .
1345	0	a	Like the ones the ones which I am most fond of in terms of giving like a theme to it would be like like lemon or something like that , you know something which is , like you see a lot in in other areas .
1346	0	a	Like I see lots of websites and things that seem to associate with like lemon and lime
1347	0	a	and
1348	0	a	So anyway it is just just an idea .
1349	0	a	Okay .
1350	0	a	Yeah .
1351	1	a	I am thinking maybe we could incorporate some of these features into a fairly into something which is which seems to have something to it which is almost gimmicky
1352	0	a	because like like something to do with like lighting within it .
1353	0	a	Like you know just within the simple sense , when you pick up a phone and touch a button it lights up , q usually the buttons light up .
1354	1	a	How can we build on that ?
1355	1	a	Maybe like it could light up in different colours or something or or people could buy the buy the control
1356	1	a	and then it comes with different like covers or something so .
1357	0	a	Okay .
1358	0	a	Anyway those are
1359	0	a	that is all I have , but hopefully we can we can revisit those ideas when we get into
1360	0	a	Yep .
1361	0	a	That is great .
1362	0	a	Uh huh .
1363	0	a	Okay great .
1364	0	a	thank you for that .
1365	1	a	Craig do you want to plug yours in then ?
1366	0	a	Is it working ?
1367	0	a	And so think of this concept .
1368	0	a	Not quite .
1369	0	a	Did you press F eight ?
1370	0	a	Yeah .
1371	0	a	It is probably not sending .
1372	0	a	Yeah .
1373	0	a	Oh something coming now , yeah .
1374	0	a	Yep , there it is .
1375	0	a	There we go .
1376	0	a	to research it I have had a look on the the homepage again .
1377	0	a	It is provided me with more examples of previously existing c remote controls .
1378	0	a	there is a wee bit of discussion about the other existing ones there , so I have taken the suggestions from them and tried to incorporate them into this
1379	0	a	So then this
1380	0	a	we are looking for suggestions on size th size of control and the buttons , the shape of the control , and whereabout the buttons should be located on the control .
1381	0	a	what I found from the research is that most the current controls are just basically big bricks with loads of buttons all over them .
1382	0	a	they are not very attractive to look at , and they are not very comfortable to hold ,
1383	0	a	they are
1384	0	a	I just hold them like big bricks , and they are very easily lost .
1385	0	a	they tend to be very dark colours , so if there are shadowy places down the side of couches you ca not really see them .
1386	0	a	the the controls themselves tend to use a very inconsistent colour scheme .
1387	0	a	for instance , the stand by button is not always red , it really should be .
1388	0	a	It is something the user then identify with .
1389	0	a	This is a red switch off , that is how it should be .
1390	0	a	I am not sure if there is any other examples of that , but something to look out for .
1391	0	a	there is a problem that I have I have got couple of preferences for the the end control I get them with the the red colour button for stand by and s the other examples of that The buttons should be large .
1392	0	a	They should not be tiny little things like you get on some mobile phones .
1393	0	a	They should be easy to press , very comfortable .
1394	0	a	one of the examples given on the homepage was there is an up and down volume button but both of them have a V on them , so the up volume button looks like it should be a down volume button
1395	0	a	, that is kind of confusing .
1396	1	a	should avoid s things like that .
1397	1	a	if the the corporate colour scheme allows it we should have a very bright colour so that it can be easily identified anywhere .
1398	0	a	Okay .
1399	0	a	obviously trying trying to avoid being tacky there , but it could tie in very easily with your your lime and lemon idea .
1400	0	a	Okay ,
1401	0	a	do we have a corporate colour scheme ?
1402	0	a	I did not know .
1403	0	a	I think it is yellow because like the website is yellow and there is a band at the bottom is yellow
1404	0	a	, so yellow , lemon , you know
1405	0	a	definitely food for thought there ,
1406	1	a	but keep going and we will discuss it after .
1407	0	a	Okay .
1408	0	a	And the Play Doh is yellow .
1409	0	a	Okay .
1410	0	a	Fantastic .
1411	0	a	Okay .
1412	0	a	any extra features we add beyond the basic ones should be m hidden ,
1413	0	a	they should not be on the
1414	0	a	should not be visible without something be opened or some sort of special extra effort .
1415	0	a	Yeah .
1416	0	a	if we did decide to go for voice activation there sh should always be a button as alternative , possibly hidden in the the opened up section making that something is wrong with it or with somebody is voice , maybe they got a cold or
1417	1	a	we should definitely avoid the big square block look .
1418	0	a	That is just wrong .
1419	0	a	kay .
1420	0	a	And we got an email from
1421	0	a	I think it is the the research department , and they have said th the voice control can now talk back if you ask it a question .
1422	0	a	So it sh it could be good to have them confirm any action you take
1423	0	a	and possibility .
1424	0	a	Aye that is a good idea , yeah .
1425	0	a	Right and these are problems I have had with it .
1426	0	a	I do not know where the slogan should go , or really what the slogan is .
1427	0	a	I think it is , fashion into electronics .
1428	0	a	Yeah .
1429	0	a	And we do not know how flexible the colour scheme is .
1430	0	a	I mean you say you wanted the the corporate colours , but they do not say you know if we can use any other colours at all
1431	0	a	or That is it .
1432	0	a	Okay .
1433	0	a	Cool .
1434	0	a	Okay .
1435	0	a	Great .
1436	0	a	Lots of good information there .
1437	0	a	Yeah that that was very good ,
1438	1	a	and now with David .
1439	0	a	kay .
1440	0	a	I think I am cool .
1441	0	a	It is a shame the cable was not just in the middle of the table ,
1442	0	a	huh ?
1443	0	a	Just
1444	0	a	It takes a second , does not it ?
1445	0	a	I know it would be handy , would not it .
1446	0	a	Oops .
1447	0	a	Do y do you want to sit in the the line of sight of this
1448	0	a	Yeah .
1449	0	a	Yeah okay .
1450	1	a	Let me just get this going first .
1451	0	a	there it is .
1452	0	a	Kay , that should be it .
1453	0	a	Okay I guess the same thing again
1454	0	a	, I started with something very basic .
1455	0	a	So just so you guys have some idea of what is involved in my process ,
1456	1	a	and then you can just work through it and we will either modify it or start from scratch depending on what your needs are .
1457	0	a	the components are exactly the same .
1458	0	a	I think , like what you guys said , the most input that is needed is basically in the user interface .
1459	0	a	The rest of the components they do have an impact in terms of cost and complexity .
1460	0	a	like you said time to market was a problem , and how many components are physically in there in cost .
1461	0	a	And the power is basically a factor of that .
1462	0	a	and the lower components , the power , the logic , the transmitter , and the infrared , they affect you in terms of the size of your device , and that would have some inte impact on how y
1463	0	a	I think more how you hold rather than the actual use using the the remote control because like we have said we have defined , like we only want the basic things that to be visible , and the rest of them we try to hide .
1464	0	a	So you know it is just a matter of working out space .
1465	0	a	So I guess three things , cost , complexity , and the size .
1466	0	a	These are the three things that will have an impact on you .
1467	0	a	So just go through it in the components .
1468	0	a	these are the options that are available to you , I am not very sure about the voice thing cause I got another email
1469	0	a	and it was in fact quite sketchy on what n the voice options are .
1470	0	a	Right .
1471	0	a	it said it could talk to you , but it never said anything about being able to listen .
1472	0	a	I it said something about a sensor but never clarified that .
1473	0	a	So maybe if you
1474	0	a	well I could see the other email that they sent you , cause they got back to me with like different requirements , or different offerings of what components availa
1475	0	a	Okay so your basic components are buttons ,
1476	0	a	okay
1477	0	a	and you have a wheel available , like a mouse scroll wheel ,
1478	0	a	okay there is an LCD display
1479	0	a	, I think these are quite standard things .
1480	0	a	Right .
1481	0	a	They are standard , are not they ?
1482	0	a	Yeah .
1483	0	a	No
1484	0	a	they are
1485	0	a	well in the sense that these are all the options available for you .
1486	1	a	I will explain to you the complexity and the cost thing again a bit later .
1487	0	a	Okay then there is how the case actually looks .
1488	0	a	It can actually be flat or it can be curved , and then the different types of materials that you can use , I do not think you can use them in a combination ,
1489	0	a	but
1490	1	a	I could check back for you ,
1491	0	a	but I do not think you can actually use them in a combination .
1492	0	a	We you could not have like plastic and rubber ?
1493	0	a	Yeah .
1494	0	a	I think plastic and rubber would be fine , but plastic , rubber , and wood , I was not I am not very sure about the titanium .
1495	0	a	They had some restrictions on using the rubber and the titanium .
1496	0	a	kay .
1497	0	a	the rubber was a restriction on the kind of power source you could use , but the titanium had a different kind of things on the shape of the thing , so I think that there is some restriction on
1498	0	a	I think you could probably group plastic and rubber together , wood and titanium , but you know it might be easier from a cost perspective and a complexity just to use one .
1499	0	a	Okay .
1500	0	a	You know as opposed to two .
1501	0	a	and the other components are logic chips , again I will I will go back to the component chips .
1502	0	a	The com how complex or how easy the logic is ,
1503	0	a	it depends on how many functions you have on the on the unit and that impacts cost .
1504	0	a	I do not think the logic chip has a issue about size cause they should be about the same size .
1505	0	a	Power consumption should be about the same .
1506	0	a	I think the main impact is complexity , and the other thing is the power options .
1507	0	a	the first one is a standard battery .
1508	0	a	Okay the second one I think is more of a gimmick then actually a useable thing ,
1509	0	a	it is a wind up you know , a crank .
1510	0	a	I will clear one of these things for you .
1511	0	a	Just by moving it
1512	0	a	yeah .
1513	0	a	Yeah
1514	0	a	but that that might be something
1515	0	a	I think that is more of a look and feel decision because I do not think you can have one power source if you are using the alternative power sources .
1516	0	a	I think whatever it is you still need a battery cause
1517	0	a	I do not think anybody wants to keep doing one thing .
1518	0	a	No .
1519	0	a	Okay the other ones are a solar powered cell , which may not be a great idea in Europe or any country that has seasons
1520	0	a	cause half the year you would be dead .
1521	0	a	Yeah .
1522	0	a	So like what I said , you probably need like a battery and something else .
1523	0	a	and the kinetic one I guess for me is the most interesting one because it is movement and people like to fiddle with their and it is a nice sales gimmick I think .
1524	0	a	From a marketing gimmick it it is a technology thing , it is a shake
1525	0	a	it
1526	0	a	it does not work , shake it , knock it or something .
1527	0	a	You know you know
1528	0	a	you have you had those balls , you know those stress balls where you bounce the ball and
1529	0	a	it and it lights up and it goes , you know that might be a gimmick combined with rubber .
1530	0	a	W
1531	0	a	yeah .
1532	0	a	yeah
1533	0	a	yeah , I see .
1534	0	a	Yeah .
1535	0	a	You know just to
1536	0	a	if you get frustrated wi remote control you can throw it ,
1537	0	a	kind of you know just you know so .
1538	0	a	Yeah .
1539	0	a	I know what you mean
1540	0	a	yeah .
1541	0	a	okay
1542	0	a	my from my role , I do not think that personal preferences but role preferences , I think something comfortable to hold , small and slim I guess that is more in the sense of small and slim in terms of comfortable not so small you ca not , you know like a phone or something , too small phone .
1543	0	a	and the other thing is from a production point of view the less components we use and the simpler the components means you reduce your cost and you increase your profit .
1544	0	a	and also the time to market and the complexity of developing designing and debugging it so .
1545	1	a	okay let me just go back and talk about some of the restrictions .
1546	0	a	The user interface restrictions basically means that if you use more complicated features , like the buttons are standard
1547	0	a	okay ,
1548	0	a	the LCD panel and the scroll wheel you need more complicated logic .
1549	0	a	the case okay with a rubber case you ca not have the solar panels .
1550	0	a	Okay with the titanium case ,
1551	1	a	let me just check that ,
1552	0	a	titanium case ca not be curved , it has to be square .
1553	0	a	Okay .
1554	0	a	Okay there is no restriction on the plastic , and it ca not be curved on the wood .
1555	0	a	It ca not be curved .
1556	0	a	Okay .
1557	0	a	So that is again , I do not think you can use them in a combination , especially the titanium
1558	0	a	I
1559	0	a	I suspect they are very fixed to a particular need .
1560	0	a	Okay .
1561	0	a	Right .
1562	0	a	So mixing them may not be a good idea
1563	0	a	yep .
1564	0	a	Okay .
1565	0	a	Right can I
1566	0	a	Yeah
1567	0	a	well yeah
1568	0	a	it is just I am quite keen to get the discussion going with the time we have left so
1569	0	a	but yeah you
1570	0	a	c ask away .
1571	0	a	That is it .
1572	0	a	question on
1573	0	a	can I ask a question ?
1574	0	a	Okay .
1575	0	a	Can we power a light in this ?
1576	0	a	Can we get a strong enough battery to power a light ?
1577	0	a	Okay .
1578	0	a	I think we could because the LCD panel requires power , and the LCD is a form of a light
1579	0	a	so that
1580	0	a	Are you thinking are you thinking of of a light in the sense of a light light , or a light in the sense of it glows kind of you know Frankenstein , it is alive .
1581	1	a	So maybe one of the things we can just try and include is a really good battery .
1582	0	a	Why what kind of light do you want are you thinking of ?
1583	0	a	Uh huh .
1584	0	a	Well
1585	0	a	I mean I am thinking it might be That for this to be a high tech thing it is going to have to have something high tech about it and that is going to take battery power , and to make that to make that a realistic goal I think one of the issues that will come up later is , can the battery power it ?
1586	0	a	Illuminate the buttons .
1587	0	a	Yeah .
1588	0	a	Yeah it glows .
1589	0	a	Well m I am thinking along the lines of you are
1590	0	a	you are in the dark watching a DVD
1591	0	a	and you you find the thing in the dark
1592	0	a	and you go like this , and that is what everybody does .
1593	0	a	Okay .
1594	0	a	Oh where is the volume button in the dark , and y you just touch it , or you just pick it up , and it lights up or something .
1595	0	a	Yeah
1596	0	a	yeah
1597	0	a	yeah .
1598	0	a	Okay .
1599	0	a	Like a phone
1600	0	a	yeah , like the backlight in a phone .
1601	0	a	Okay .
1602	0	a	Like a phone , yeah
1603	0	a	yeah .
1604	0	a	Okay cool .
1605	0	a	Whereas with phones , people charge them once a week .
1606	0	a	Yeah .
1607	1	a	We are going to need to put in a really good battery so people do not have to charge their r remote control every few days .
1608	0	a	that is why I think the option of the the kinetic thing which basically means as long as you shake it like a watch , like an automatic watch
1609	0	a	it is probably sensitive enough when you fiddle it .
1610	0	a	But are people going to want to shake their movie controller ?
1611	0	a	Right .
1612	1	a	So you could trigger that to a light ,
1613	0	a	like I said the bouncing ball thing ,
1614	1	a	or you could trigger that to use that to power the light
1615	0	a	as opposed to
1616	0	a	so when they pick it up , right , and then that that sorta triggers the glowingness .
1617	0	a	Sure .
1618	0	a	Okay .
1619	0	a	Okay .
1620	0	a	Right .
1621	0	a	Okay .
1622	0	a	Right okay
1623	0	a	well
1624	1	a	let is just go right back to the marketing ideas for a start ,
1625	0	a	and just giving an id idea on the time , we have got about fifteen minutes to play with at most .
1626	0	a	Okay , great .
1627	0	a	Okay .
1628	0	a	So yeah
1629	0	a	so just t to bear in mind that the ultimate goal of this meeting is to reach an decision on the the the concepts of the product .
1630	1	a	So back to your idea about incorporating the idea of like fruit and veg , and the corporate colour , and things like that .
1631	0	a	Okay .
1632	0	a	Yeah .
1633	0	a	Yeah .
1634	0	a	I mean what does everybody think about
1635	1	a	Does anybody have any ideas of about how we can fit all that in together ?
1636	0	a	I mean that is kind of the user interface type of thing ,
1637	1	a	what are your thoughts on that ?
1638	0	a	So maybe do y are we thinking something that like s could sit in your hand comfortably , or do you th you would hold onto comfortably or
1639	0	a	So something quite curvy ?
1640	0	a	Okay
1641	0	a	right okay .
1642	1	a	I think we could go for like maybe not a p a fruit shape but a very sort of curvy type shape .
1643	1	a	you could have the same sort of texture and colour as a fruit .
1644	0	a	probably something that s sits in your hand comfortably , sort of feels right in your hand .
1645	0	a	Colour wise
1646	0	a	I mean you made a re
1647	0	a	was it you
1648	0	a	or I ca not remember who made the point about how if you have a nice bright colour you will not lose it ,
1649	0	a	was that Whose
1650	0	a	about how if you have a bright colour you will not lose it so much .
1651	0	a	I think he made that .
1652	0	a	What is that ?
1653	0	a	Yeah .
1654	0	a	and when the corporate colour is yellow ,
1655	1	a	I mean maybe we could think about about the colour of the whole product being yellow
1656	0	a	I do not know .
1657	0	a	Okay .
1658	0	a	And then obviously the the materials
1659	0	a	when it
1660	1	a	has anybody got like an overall picture in their mind about what what might work ?
1661	0	a	That is all .
1662	1	a	Well I mean I am thinking that what we need to do is have something that kind of unifies a lot of the different concepts ,
1663	0	a	and if we think that what we are w our number one marketing motive is the look and feel .
1664	1	a	So for the look and feel to seem coherent and not just sorta bits and bits and pieces of of concept and technology or or whatever or fashion , then we should have it kind of come back to one thing that we kind of all sorta can visualize .
1665	1	a	maybe what we could do is t th think about a concept which touches b back to the on the the colour ,
1666	0	a	you said company colour yellow .
1667	1	a	I mean if we think of something ,
1668	0	a	like I was saying also lime and lemon you know ,
1669	1	a	what can we come up with something where we we try and associate it with with like the series .
1670	1	a	We just come up with something like that we kind of use it as a theme to inspire the shapes and things .
1671	0	a	Okay .
1672	0	a	Right .
1673	0	a	Is there a particular shape that you are interested in ?
1674	0	a	Like does marketing have any research on does it need to be long ?
1675	0	a	Does it need with a square thing wha
1676	0	a	Yeah
1677	0	a	cause that will n help narrow down the choice of Like fruit .
1678	0	a	Oh you know like in circular in shape or Choice of material
1679	0	a	yeah .
1680	0	a	Yeah .
1681	0	a	Cause I
1682	0	a	I
1683	0	a	I was kind of thinking about as well you know how you get these shock resistant mobile phones , and they are plastic but then also have like rubber on the outside , and it kind of feels it feels kind of warmer to the touch .
1684	0	a	I am thinking fruits in my head , but that is tacky .
1685	0	a	See I am
1686	1	a	I would quite like a sort of snowman type shape .
1687	0	a	It feels a bit more comfortable ,
1688	1	a	and maybe we could incorporate plastic and rubber into it .
1689	1	a	And then then we could have curved shapes ,
1690	0	a	cause wood or titanium ,
1691	0	a	yeah , it is going to have to be boxy and rectangular
1692	0	a	and I think we might be moving away from that you know
1693	0	a	so
1694	0	a	Well I am
1695	0	a	do we really want it in like the shape of a lemon or
1696	0	a	no I do not think we do either .
1697	0	a	No no no not at all .
1698	1	a	It is more more just that we we think about like what it is we are trying to achieve , so and then we have one one sorta theme that we stick with .
1699	0	a	Do you know what I mean ?
1700	0	a	Right , sure .
1701	0	a	Okay right well
1702	1	a	so thoughts about the actual shape of the thing .
1703	0	a	A snowman shape ?
1704	0	a	Uh huh .
1705	0	a	so a p sort of larger bit sits in your hand , and then you got maybe another bubble at the top for just any other function you need .
1706	0	a	That is quite a distinctive shape , that would be good
1707	0	a	would not it .
1708	0	a	Yeah .
1709	0	a	Yeah
1710	0	a	so yeah should we go with that ?
1711	1	a	Do you want to draw it on the board ?
1712	0	a	Ooh that would be good .
1713	0	a	can we yeah like to and wha
1714	0	a	like do you have a
1715	0	a	Can you like
1716	0	a	yeah
1717	0	a	just t we can visualize it .
1718	1	a	something like that you got two groups there maybe it could fold up and you get a third group inside or you have volume controls about there .
1719	0	a	Okay .
1720	0	a	Okay .
1721	0	a	Yep .
1722	1	a	So call it the snowman shape trademark .
1723	0	a	Yeah that is cool .
1724	1	a	and I mean colour wise what does everybody think ?
1725	1	a	I think it is quite important to get yellow in there somewhere .
1726	0	a	I mean do you want the whole thing yellow ,
1727	1	a	maybe like yellow and white
1728	0	a	do you want something
1729	0	a	Uh huh .
1730	1	a	So I reckon it would look quite nice if we just had this here , had a sorta background yellow , and then have sort of a nice bold colour for the buttons .
1731	0	a	Okay cool .
1732	1	a	and also I mean how are we going to incorporate the slogan in ?
1733	1	a	The fact that it talks to you , I mean it might be quite cool if when you first start using it it says , what is it , putting fashion into electronics or something ,
1734	0	a	I dunno .
1735	0	a	Or when you like
1736	1	a	or if you turn it off or something if it can speak if it could actually say the slogan it might be a bit more powerful than just having it written on it somewhere .
1737	0	a	I think that might scare me .
1738	0	a	I d I d any thoughts on that at all ?
1739	0	a	I know .
1740	0	a	I think that would probably scare me .
1741	0	a	You turn it on your control possessed s .
1742	0	a	unless an a I mean if you
1743	1	a	also would that work if we wanted to incorporate an LCD display , where would we put that ?
1744	1	a	Would we put that on the inside or
1745	0	a	It is bound to increase the cost of it a lot , I would have thought .
1746	0	a	Nah .
1747	0	a	Do we need an LCD display ?
1748	0	a	What what is the functionality of that ?
1749	0	a	Yeah
1750	0	a	but the question is what are we using it what would we what would we achieve from it ?
1751	0	a	Putting in lights is cheap but putting in an LCD panel just to make it glow is a bit of a
1752	0	a	What would it achieve ?
1753	0	a	Well LC well
1754	0	a	I would
1755	0	a	when you used to mention the LCD I would think I wonder what that would be about .
1756	1	a	And the th the thing I could see it helping with would be if it was somehow connected with listings .
1757	1	a	So as you scroll through , cause we said we might have a jog dial , so as you scroll through your stations you can y
1758	1	a	it actually tells you what it is .
1759	0	a	Yeah .
1760	0	a	I think that will be a problem because we do not have an input device to get the listings into it ,
1761	0	a	so it is a bit nuts to get the Monday Tuesday Wednesday you know .
1762	0	a	Right , okay .
1763	0	a	oh yeah that is true .
1764	0	a	Yeah .
1765	0	a	So so no need for an LCD display ?
1766	0	a	I think that would make it very complex .
1767	0	a	I I am not saying there is no need for an LCD display ,
1768	0	a	but it is what is what what would it tell the user ,
1769	0	a	cause the LCD tends to be an output as as opposed to an input so does the remote control need to talk back to the user ?
1770	0	a	We have the option of the speaker as well
1771	0	a	the sa the same thing goes for the speaker , is there a need for the remote control to to talk back ?
1772	1	a	You could put a game on it .
1773	0	a	Yeah .
1774	0	a	Yeah .
1775	0	a	not real
1776	0	a	I do not know if there is really , no I would say no need for a talk back .
1777	0	a	does anybody disagree with that ?
1778	0	a	No ?
1779	0	a	Easy .
1780	0	a	No .
1781	0	a	When the TV dies you can play with the remote control .
1782	0	a	Okay right
1783	0	a	so you are going to have the three different sets of of functionalities ,
1784	1	a	I mean do you want to group them into s head of the snowman , body of the snowman , inside of the snowman ,
1785	0	a	is that what you are thinking ?
1786	0	a	Okay .
1787	1	a	well I think the advanced ones the the ones you do not usually use could be hid inside .
1788	0	a	B
1789	0	a	I think the we had were fairly basic ones ,
1790	1	a	they would have to go on the the front somewhere .
1791	0	a	Okay
1792	0	a	right
1793	1	a	what else do you need to talk about ?
1794	1	a	So I am just going to pop this in here
1795	0	a	cause I have a slide about decision making which I would forgotten about .
1796	0	a	Well i I was just
1797	0	a	Yeah .
1798	0	a	Where would you physically position the buttons ?
1799	0	a	I think that that has some impact on on on many things .
1800	0	a	Yeah .
1801	0	a	Yeah I think so yeah .
1802	0	a	maybe you want to draw onto the
1803	0	a	Yep .
1804	0	a	Oh sh God
1805	0	a	we have got five minutes
1806	0	a	okay
1807	0	a	back we go .
1808	0	a	energy what do you think that is suggesting we are how we are powering the thing ?
1809	0	a	I really like the idea of this kinetic thing where you would have the back up of the battery , but have have kinetic power ,
1810	0	a	I mean what does anybody think about that ?
1811	0	a	Okay .
1812	0	a	Yeah , sure .
1813	0	a	I have had kinetic things before , and the the the one issue we need to keep in mind with them is that you are committing the user to moving it ,
1814	0	a	and watches yeah
1815	0	a	Sure , okay , right , okay .
1816	0	a	No ,
1817	0	a	like I said we have a h hybrid kind of thing , so it is not going to charge the battery , it is just
1818	0	a	Yeah .
1819	0	a	Support for it .
1820	0	a	I mean just
1821	0	a	it is just worth pointing out because like I have I have known
1822	0	a	I have known people to have kinetic watches that they wear all the time , and it is just like magic because it is always powered and there is no battery .
1823	0	a	I have also known people to have things like like a jewellery watch they wear from time to time , and they eventually just say it is just too much of a nuisance because I do not wear it all the time .
1824	0	a	Yeah .
1825	0	a	Yep .
1826	0	a	Like remote control is similar , you are away on vacation , I dunno
1827	0	a	whatever , you something , and it just starts to get worn down .
1828	0	a	Yeah .
1829	1	a	So we should think about
1830	0	a	Yeah .
1831	0	a	Well I suppose that if you are if you are away
1832	0	a	and you are not using it , then you are not using any power either .
1833	0	a	So you would have the battery as the kind of to keep it ticking over idea
1834	0	a	I am really sorry
1835	1	a	we are going to have to wrap up quite quickly ,
1836	0	a	we do not have as much time as I thought .
1837	0	a	Yep .
1838	0	a	so I think that is what energy is referring to here .
1839	0	a	Chip on print , is that that is an industrial design thing , is it David ?
1840	0	a	Okay as for the case , kind of discussed that
1841	0	a	Yeah
1842	0	a	I know we are going to have like rubber buttons
1843	0	a	that feel kind of
1844	0	a	Okay .
1845	0	a	Yes yes .
1846	1	a	And this size here , I would suggest this be small , like quite small .
1847	0	a	just a a lot of the
1848	0	a	I mean one of the things running through my mind right now , I realise we are being efficient to wrap up the meeting and have lots of decisions made , but we are leaning quite a bit to the side of being low tech , rubber buttons plastic frame ,
1849	0	a	it is almost like we are reproducing the same old remote control that is out there .
1850	0	a	kay .
1851	1	a	Should we think about how we are actually getting this high tech user friendly theme
1852	1	a	like what is it that we are u we are using to to achieve those goals ?
1853	0	a	Like
1854	0	a	Okay so so backlighting , that would be good .
1855	1	a	Could have things like backlighting the buttons and stuff like that .
1856	1	a	Or even a clear case .
1857	0	a	you know a a glowing a a glowing yellow type case where the yellow is showable , but in the dark it sort of , it is alive .
1858	0	a	Yeah clear , Okay .
1859	0	a	Aye that would be a good idea .
1860	0	a	Yeah sure .
1861	0	a	in in a slight subtle way .
1862	0	a	S so like cur slightly transparent case , so it is yellow , like tinted yellow , but you can maybe see through it .
1863	0	a	Yeah that would be really good .
1864	0	a	Yeah yeah .
1865	0	a	Yeah .
1866	0	a	Yeah .
1867	0	a	Is that what you mean ?
1868	0	a	Okay .
1869	1	a	Or or there might be a light running through it like a mouse .
1870	0	a	Sure .
1871	0	a	You know you have cordless mice
1872	0	a	and they do not eat that much power right .
1873	0	a	Yeah ,
1874	0	a	yeah .
1875	0	a	So the power the battery in that sense ,
1876	1	a	maybe you have one or two stratig strategically placed lights
1877	0	a	that sort of
1878	0	a	Yeah
1879	0	a	but because the case is transparent so it gives it a little bit of a glow , does not make it freaky .
1880	0	a	Yeah .
1881	0	a	Sure .
1882	0	a	Yeah they they emanate a light through it .
1883	0	a	Lights .
1884	0	a	Kay .
1885	0	a	Yeah , .
1886	0	a	Okay .
1887	0	a	and then the other thing that we we are s
1888	0	a	we have committed ourselves to achieving is simplicity ,
1889	1	a	and so I am thinking maybe should we try and think about having something like some kind of an innovative concept about how the the volume and the channels are controlled ,
1890	0	a	cause that is the main thing people will f want to do .
1891	1	a	Could we use like a jog dial , like a nice just sort of round , somewhere on it where you just roll it ?
1892	0	a	Or
1893	0	a	Yeah .
1894	0	a	The question is when you are rolling it , how do you want to roll it ?
1895	0	a	Do you want them to roll it like that ?
1896	0	a	Do you want them to roll it like that ?
1897	0	a	Cause in a mouse your hand is in a position to roll it , whereas the other thing about having it jog dial this way , it tends to get moved accidentally .
1898	0	a	Yeah .
1899	1	a	Yeah if you are holding it in your hand you could you could do that , could not you ?
1900	1	a	If you are holding it in your hand
1901	1	a	you could
1902	0	a	Do you think ?
1903	0	a	Okay .
1904	1	a	Well why do not we do it like a mouse then ?
1905	0	a	Yeah .
1906	0	a	That is a very unnatural motion to
1907	0	a	yeah .
1908	0	a	Can you imagine you have to scroll a lot .
1909	0	a	it might work for volume , and maybe some of the brightness controls and stuff like that , but not for channels right .
1910	0	a	If you have a Telewest box you have got like , you do not have to buy all the channels , you have about fifty channels ,
1911	0	a	can you imagine trying to .
1912	0	a	Yeah
1913	0	a	okay okay
1914	0	a	Yeah .
1915	0	a	Yeah .
1916	0	a	Yeah , sure .
1917	0	a	and I do not think having that you know too quick too slow kin it is confusing to the I
1918	0	a	dunno .
1919	0	a	Well , but then for for skipping a large amount of channels you do have to to skip the channel button , the number part .
1920	0	a	But users tend to tend to want to use that and once they lose out on the user experience they are like Because that is becomes the most accessible thing in front of
1921	0	a	Yeah .
1922	0	a	Yeah .
1923	0	a	Okay .
1924	0	a	but
1925	0	a	Yeah .
1926	0	a	Okay .
1927	0	a	But that is not a bad thing is it ?
1928	0	a	Because when you think about it , the alternative is to go push the button .
1929	0	a	Just
1930	0	a	Okay
1931	0	a	right well would not it
1932	1	a	we do need to make a decision on whether we want to incorporate a jog dial in nice and quickly .
1933	0	a	Jog dials are much easier than that .
1934	0	a	You just roll .
1935	0	a	I am all for them actually , I think they are quite you know th very quick to m to use .
1936	0	a	Yeah .
1937	0	a	Yeah .
1938	0	a	So does anybody oppose the idea of of incorporating one into the design at all ?
1939	0	a	No .
1940	1	a	And the other thing was can we think of any way of getting the slogan into this thing ?
1941	0	a	Uh huh .
1942	0	a	Yeah
1943	0	a	like I mean
1944	1	a	if we if if we keep coming back to this board here , I would not be surprised if we could take this idea , imagine that , I dunno , that it is within the shape of the hand , it is quite small
1945	0	a	I dunno .
1946	0	a	Uh huh
1947	0	a	ooh okay ,
1948	0	a	we really gotta wrap up
1949	0	a	so yeah .
1950	0	a	Yeah .
1951	0	a	It is small ,
1952	1	a	and that we have got like the the l slogan somewhere like on the casing at the side ,
1953	0	a	and that yeah
1954	0	a	well I mean is not that what we just h said said we s just have to decide now ?
1955	0	a	Yeah .
1956	0	a	Okay well if we can do that , great .
1957	0	a	Yeah okay .
1958	0	a	Yeah
1959	1	a	let is let is try and get the slogan on there
1960	0	a	, and
1961	0	a	And then like a jo
1962	1	a	And then like a jog dial somewhere that fits in with the shape of it
1963	1	a	like I dunno like here , in with the
1964	0	a	It would get bumped , it is does not really fit with your hand .
1965	0	a	So you want to expand the shape of the
1966	0	a	That that might have one problem in terms of in terms of whether you are left handed or you are right handed you might be locking yourself in .
1967	0	a	Yeah .
1968	1	a	Or maybe just fit it in like down the middle here .
1969	1	a	Could I just could I just jump in and suggest something quickly ?
1970	0	a	I think one thing would be the jog dial cause that is going to have quite a big impact on the thing
1971	0	a	Yeah that is what I was thinking the
1972	1	a	a slide , because then you you do not have to put the hand .
1973	0	a	Okay .
1974	0	a	Right I am going to have to
1975	1	a	I am really going to have to hurry you on here cause we are
1976	1	a	we are actually over time .
1977	0	a	A jog di
1978	0	a	Yeah
1979	0	a	It is kind of yeah
1980	0	a	Yeah .
1981	0	a	is there anything anybody is unsure about ?
1982	0	a	Just for in closing just
1983	0	a	the next meeting is going to be in thirty minutes , and so you can see in the screen here what each of you are going to hopefully be doing
1984	0	a	, I know that the designers are going to be working with Play doh on that .
1985	0	a	So
1986	0	a	that will be that will be good .
1987	0	a	Huh .
1988	1	a	and I will get the the minutes up as soon as possible .
1989	0	a	Anything at all you think we have not discussed that we need to ?
1990	0	a	Is everybody kind of happy about what they are going to be doing ?
1991	0	a	Okay .
1992	0	a	Yeah I think the jog dial ,
1993	0	a	you know it just after you drew that ,
1994	1	a	what if it was flat and you just spun it ,
1995	0	a	that would be great .
1996	0	a	Yeah .
1997	0	a	Yep .
1998	0	a	I think incorporating a logo is quite straight forward .
1999	0	a	There is lots of space for it
2000	0	a	Yeah
2001	0	a	but it is also a a marketing and a function
2002	0	a	Yeah .
2003	1	a	That is kind of a design thing that you guys can can discuss , yeah .
2004	0	a	Sure , yeah , yeah
2005	0	a	and materials we sorta said we would do plastic and rubber , did not we ,
2006	1	a	and I think maybe we should try and stay away from just the big protruding rubber buttons , cause that would just be so standard .
2007	0	a	Okay .
2008	0	a	Yeah .
2009	1	a	To make something flush with the case ?
2010	0	a	Okay right .
2011	0	a	Something a bit more flush , yeah ,
2012	1	a	or maybe have rubber incorporated into the case as well ,
2013	0	a	so that it has
2014	0	a	and also t plastic I have seen can get really textured , so you can get plastics that actually feel soft in your hand .
2015	0	a	Okay .
2016	1	a	Sp kind of grippy ?
2017	0	a	Okay .
2018	0	a	Feel like fruit .
2019	0	a	Fruits kids .
2020	0	a	They feel kind of like , you get pens now and then that you would think that they were rubber
2021	0	a	but they are not , they are actually just plastic that is textured ,
2022	0	a	kind of a little bit like
2023	0	a	Okay .
2024	0	a	No like
2025	0	a	Yeah yeah .
2026	0	a	Yeah yeah kind of like that
2027	0	a	yeah .
2028	0	a	Okay
2029	1	a	I am going to have to
2030	1	a	I am going to have to call this to a close cause we are way over time .
2031	0	a	So that is really good ,
2032	0	a	like we have s had much to talk about that pretty much run out of time to do so .
2033	1	a	So off you go and design stuff
2034	0	a	wooh .
2035	0	a	Play doh time .
2036	0	a	You got to choose first .
2037	0	a	No , we are kidding .
2038	0	a	Okay ,
2039	0	a	can I just swipe your power cable ,
2040	0	a	I do not think it matters .
2041	0	a	Okay lemme okay ,
2042	0	a	I am going to pull everybody out first and then put in whoever needs to be left .
2043	0	a	It is you .
2044	0	a	Argh .
2045	0	a	This is a real hassle and a
2046	0	a	oops .
2047	0	a	I am going to take the microphones , cause it is too lazy t take them off again .
2048	0	a	 
2049	0	a	Okay we all all set ?
2050	0	a	Right .
2051	0	a	Well this is the final detailed design meeting .
2052	0	a	we are going to discuss the look and feel design , the user interface design , and we are going to evaluate the product .
2053	0	a	And the end result of this meeting has to be a decision on the details of this remote control , like absolute final decision , and then I am going to have to specify the final design in the final report .
2054	0	a	So
2055	1	a	just from from last time to recap ,
2056	0	a	we said we were going to have a snowman shaped remote control with no LCD display , no need for talk back , it was hopefully going to be kinetic power and battery with rubber buttons , maybe backlighting the buttons with some internal LEDs to shine through the casing , hopefully a jog dial , and incorporating the slogan somewhere as well .
2057	0	a	Anything I have missed ?
2058	0	a	Okay
2059	0	a	so
2060	1	a	if you want to present your prototype go ahead .
2061	0	a	No .
2062	0	a	Uh oh .
2063	0	a	This is it ? , there are a few changes we have made .
2064	0	a	Ninja Homer , made in Japan .
2065	0	a	, well look at the expense sheet , and it turned to be quite a lot expensive to have open up and have lots of buttons and stuff inside ,
2066	0	a	so instead we have
2067	0	a	this is going to be an LCD screen , just a a very very basic one , very small with access to the menu through the the scroll wheel and confirm button .
2068	0	a	Okay .
2069	0	a	kay .
2070	0	a	, apart from that , it is just pretty much the same as we discussed last time .
2071	0	a	And there is not d it does not open up to the advanced functions ?
2072	0	a	the advanced functions are still hidden from you , but they are hidden in the sense that they are not in use .
2073	0	a	Where are they ?
2074	0	a	, right .
2075	0	a	they are in the LCD panel and the jog dial ?
2076	0	a	Okay cause
2077	0	a	The LCD panel just displays functionally what you are doing .
2078	0	a	Great .
2079	0	a	So w what kind of thing is going to be
2080	0	a	If you are using an advanced function right , like c brightness , contrast , whatever , it will just say
2081	0	a	You know it is like
2082	0	a	it only has four columns , it is a very simple LCD like , whereas many the minimum amount we need that the user will automatically know like this is brightness or this is contrast .
2083	0	a	Right .
2084	0	a	Okay .
2085	0	a	Right .
2086	0	a	Right , kay .
2087	0	a	Okay cool .
2088	0	a	It might even be one , a bit more complex LCD panel with pictures like maybe the sun or the , you know , the the symbols of the various functions .
2089	0	a	Okay ,
2090	0	a	and what is this here ?
2091	0	a	Okay so the number pad is
2092	0	a	Kay , great .
2093	0	a	Oh right
2094	0	a	okay .
2095	0	a	Cool .
2096	0	a	That is a number pad .
2097	0	a	Where are we going to have the slogan ?
2098	0	a	Okay cool .
2099	0	a	they are al along this
2100	0	a	Yeah .
2101	0	a	You know ,
2102	0	a	just like right inside there .
2103	0	a	You have this space here , and then you have this thing on the side as well , or at the bottom .
2104	0	a	Okay .
2105	0	a	Cause slogans are usually quite small , right , they are not like huge
2106	0	a	so they are s
2107	0	a	Say a button is about
2108	0	a	say a button is about this size , right , so you would still have plenty of space for a slogan , say even for that .
2109	0	a	Yep .
2110	0	a	Okay .
2111	0	a	Looks good .
2112	0	a	Yep .
2113	0	a	So if this is not to scale , what kind of dimensions are you thinking about here ?
2114	0	a	Well we want the other buttons to be big enough to push easily with a finger
2115	0	a	so we reckon maybe that will be about the same size as the palm of your hand .
2116	0	a	Okay .
2117	0	a	Yep
2118	0	a	so that would be about a centimetre for a button , so one two three four centimetres .
2119	0	a	Plus maybe half o five six seven eight , about yeah nine total .
2120	0	a	About nine in total .
2121	0	a	Six , seven , eight , nine , ten .
2122	0	a	So we are talking about ten centimetres .
2123	0	a	That sounds good .
2124	0	a	Yeah .
2125	0	a	That would be good .
2126	0	a	Yep .
2127	0	a	So ten centimetres in height .
2128	0	a	Nine , ten .
2129	0	a	Yep .
2130	0	a	Okay .
2131	0	a	That would be good ,
2132	0	a	in fact a pen is about ten centimetres usually ,
2133	0	a	so that would be
2134	0	a	that sounds like a really good size , if you see it there .
2135	0	a	Yeah .
2136	0	a	That is great
2137	0	a	and it is very bright as well .
2138	0	a	So okay .
2139	0	a	Is it possible
2140	1	a	I am just going to bring up the idea of colours .
2141	0	a	Is these are these the colours that of production , or is this just what we had available ?
2142	0	a	Right .
2143	0	a	Well I am
2144	0	a	We are going to have again the the sort of the foggy yellow from last time that lit up when you pushed the button .
2145	0	a	But
2146	0	a	this button , because it is red it is sort of very prominent , we are going to use it as it can be the power button if you hold it for maybe two seconds it will send a stand by signal .
2147	0	a	Okay
2148	0	a	so just
2149	1	a	could you just list all the things that it does
2150	1	a	s
2151	1	a	so I can write them in the report .
2152	0	a	apart from that it is going to be used as a confirm button for the LCD screen and you use this as a jog dial .
2153	0	a	Excuse me .
2154	0	a	Sure .
2155	0	a	Okay .
2156	0	a	Okay
2157	0	a	so that is like an okay button , right .
2158	0	a	Oh we have discussed how h high it is , but how wide is it ?
2159	0	a	No as in the height , but what about the width ?
2160	0	a	Do we need five ?
2161	0	a	I do not think five is
2162	0	a	be about th three and a half .
2163	0	a	I do not know .
2164	0	a	Okay .
2165	0	a	How high is it ?
2166	0	a	Yeah .
2167	0	a	Did not put five centimetres .
2168	0	a	Oh oh
2169	0	a	like depth of the actual thing .
2170	0	a	Okay .
2171	0	a	Something by there .
2172	0	a	Oh is this k to get an idea of scale from your from your thing there okay .
2173	0	a	Yeah ,
2174	0	a	yeah .
2175	0	a	Sure .
2176	0	a	So you can power on and off ,
2177	0	a	what else can you do ?
2178	0	a	Okay .
2179	0	a	Three and a half .
2180	0	a	you can skip straight to a channel using these buttons .
2181	0	a	, were going to have the volume control here , but because we have got the the LCD and the jog dial we just thought we would use that as the volume .
2182	0	a	Okay jog dial for volume .
2183	0	a	And what else do you do with the jog dial ?
2184	0	a	Contrast ,
2185	0	a	brightness ,
2186	0	a	yeah ,
2187	0	a	and anything else ?
2188	0	a	Well of the designers what are they ?
2189	0	a	Uh huh .
2190	0	a	you can use it for more advanced functions like contrast , colour
2191	0	a	and
2192	0	a	yeah .
2193	0	a	just whatever else we wanted to include as the advanced functions , we did not actually go through and specify the
2194	0	a	what can a TV do ?
2195	0	a	Okay things like brightness , contrast , maybe tuning the channels .
2196	0	a	Okay channel tuning .
2197	0	a	That is a good one .
2198	0	a	What else ?
2199	0	a	the various inputs .
2200	0	a	Are you having a VCR , are you having you know which input do you have ?
2201	0	a	Okay
2202	0	a	auxiliary inputs .
2203	0	a	probably colour or sharpness .
2204	0	a	Yep ,
2205	0	a	colour , sharpness .
2206	0	a	Sharpness .
2207	0	a	a lot of these things will have to be free and open for users to define them .
2208	0	a	Okay what about sound settings ?
2209	0	a	d can you change any of those at all ?
2210	0	a	Okay .
2211	0	a	Audio .
2212	0	a	Audio , we have like your basic y your base , your mid range , your high range .
2213	0	a	the the balance .
2214	0	a	Yep ,
2215	0	a	left right balance , maybe even pre programmed sound modes , like the user could determine like a series of sound modes , and then what could happen would be when you click on that then it would go to that setting .
2216	0	a	Okay ,
2217	0	a	is there anything else at all it can do ?
2218	0	a	That
2219	0	a	cause that is that is fine .
2220	0	a	kay .
2221	0	a	Yeah .
2222	0	a	Just need to know
2223	0	a	so I can write it down .
2224	0	a	Okay right
2225	0	a	I g
2226	0	a	I guess that is it ,
2227	0	a	so we can now
2228	1	a	We can now have a little look at the the Excel sheet and price listing , and see if we need to if we need to rethink anything at all .
2229	0	a	So
2230	0	a	for this first part here power wise , have we got battery ?
2231	0	a	Do we have kinetic as well ?
2232	0	a	No .
2233	0	a	The battery .
2234	0	a	No .
2235	0	a	Okay ,
2236	0	a	just battery .
2237	0	a	We need an
2238	0	a	Yep .
2239	0	a	And that is because of cost restraints is it ?
2240	0	a	Okay
2241	0	a	what about the electronics here ?
2242	0	a	Advanced chip .
2243	0	a	Yeah .
2244	0	a	Yeah advanced chip .
2245	0	a	We need an advanced chip I think , yep .
2246	1	a	Let me just confirm that .
2247	0	a	Yes I think so .
2248	0	a	Yep .
2249	0	a	Okay
2250	0	a	the case , what does it mean by single and double , do you know ?
2251	0	a	So we want double curved ?
2252	0	a	Okay .
2253	0	a	I think single would just be sort of one sort of oval whereas double is this sort of thing .
2254	0	a	Yeah .
2255	0	a	Yep .
2256	0	a	Plastic .
2257	0	a	Is there any rubber at all in the buttons or any
2258	0	a	Okay ,
2259	0	a	and we wanted special colours did not we ?
2260	1	a	So I will have to put that
2261	0	a	Oh no wait
2262	0	a	we
2263	0	a	ho how many colours have we got there ?
2264	0	a	Just one colour , okay .
2265	0	a	I think we are going to have to skip the rubber .
2266	0	a	Yep .
2267	0	a	For the case itself , one colour .
2268	0	a	It is one special colour .
2269	0	a	Cause the case unit itself , the rest of our components go on top of it .
2270	0	a	Okay
2271	0	a	so interface wise , is it this third option we have , the two of them there ?
2272	0	a	Okay
2273	0	a	and then buttons , we have what , two colours ?
2274	0	a	Like
2275	0	a	oh wait
2276	0	a	so push button and integrated scroll wheel push
2277	0	a	okay .
2278	0	a	Yes .
2279	0	a	One and the LC display .
2280	0	a	How many
2281	0	a	We have got push buttons as well .
2282	0	a	we have got some push buttons as well .
2283	1	a	Or even clear .
2284	0	a	Kay .
2285	0	a	So I reckon we have got one button for this thing cause it is just one big sheet of rubber .
2286	0	a	Uh huh .
2287	0	a	I am not sure if that counts but
2288	0	a	You can see we are we are all very far beyond the
2289	1	a	Well we could take out ones by making it single curved , just fill in those bits .
2290	0	a	Okay .
2291	1	a	Okay let is just be safe and put
2292	1	a	like say four buttons for that one .
2293	0	a	Okay .
2294	0	a	Okay
2295	1	a	and maybe a special colour for the buttons , so maybe four again .
2296	0	a	Four .
2297	0	a	So w why are we arriving at the number four ?
2298	0	a	Where does the number four come from ?
2299	0	a	Okay right ,
2300	0	a	so we are writing down four .
2301	0	a	Cause that is one button by its the complexity of twelve buttons .
2302	0	a	So we are just estimating that yeah it would be less .
2303	0	a	Okay .
2304	0	a	How about these ?
2305	0	a	Are we wanting them in
2306	0	a	no
2307	0	a	they are just
2308	0	a	is everything going to be plastic ?
2309	0	a	Okay .
2310	0	a	No .
2311	0	a	Yep .
2312	0	a	Yep .
2313	0	a	So we are w w quite far over .
2314	0	a	Now we are going to
2315	0	a	something is going to have to go .
2316	0	a	we are at sixteen point eight
2317	0	a	and
2318	0	a	Well we h something has to go to the tune of two point t three Euro ,
2319	0	a	so
2320	1	a	let me see ,
2321	0	a	what are we
2322	0	a	I mean
2323	0	a	oh yes
2324	0	a	sorry ,
2325	0	a	four point three .
2326	0	a	how
2327	0	a	how are we going to achieve this high end product if
2328	0	a	We only have very sparse
2329	0	a	Two point three ?
2330	0	a	Four point three
2331	0	a	no ?
2332	0	a	And then where is the
2333	0	a	My maths is all out .
2334	0	a	Yeah .
2335	0	a	How much would that save us ?
2336	0	a	That will only save you one .
2337	0	a	How much would that save us ?
2338	0	a	One .
2339	0	a	That is one .
2340	1	a	The other thing could be that you could take away the LCD panel and the advanced chip together ,
2341	0	a	because when you do something on the TV , the TV responds and reacts as well , so the user could be looking at the TV and pushing his thing
2342	0	a	so we may not need to
2343	0	a	so when we scroll we need just some way to get the TV to respond , which I think is a technically doable thing so Yep .
2344	0	a	That is fair enough , yeah .
2345	0	a	Okay so
2346	0	a	So w what is our reviewed suggestion ?
2347	0	a	take away the LC display ?
2348	0	a	To be replaced with a
2349	0	a	regular chip .
2350	0	a	And the advanced chip goes away as well .
2351	0	a	Regular chip .
2352	0	a	Yep .
2353	0	a	Okay .
2354	0	a	So what that means is that
2355	0	a	The twelve buttons that you see there .
2356	0	a	And so we have got point three to get rid of .
2357	0	a	and we ha
2358	0	a	where are the four the four push buttons are where exactly now ?
2359	0	a	Twelve buttons .
2360	0	a	That is one piece of rubber but it is going to have twelve button things underneath so
2361	0	a	Yeah w
2362	0	a	So I reckon
2363	0	a	Reckon that probably counts as a special form for the buttons .
2364	0	a	Yeah .
2365	0	a	Functionally you are going to have to intercept
2366	0	a	So four is a good estimate for Yeah ,
2367	0	a	so you ca not actually cut
2368	0	a	It is like three times the number of buttons , four , eight , twelve .
2369	0	a	Do you think ?
2370	0	a	Like is is that one big button or is it twelve buttons , how can it be something in between ?
2371	0	a	It It needs to be more than one big button because if you open up your phone , underneath there is actually one button underneath , it is just that the panel itself is a single panel .
2372	0	a	Okay
2373	0	a	well we have point three to get rid of somewhere .
2374	1	a	We just report that it has to be over budget , or the colours , you could take away
2375	1	a	s colours for th for the buttons .
2376	0	a	No can do .
2377	0	a	Yeah
2378	1	a	we could just go with
2379	1	a	Normal coloured buttons .
2380	0	a	Well do you want colour differentiation here ?
2381	0	a	Oh yeah sorry
2382	0	a	yeah then .
2383	0	a	No that is not the button we are talking about .
2384	0	a	That is
2385	0	a	the buttons only refer to the pad so
2386	1	a	Should we take that off ?
2387	0	a	Hey it is back to the original .
2388	0	a	Right
2389	0	a	so
2390	0	a	That is it .
2391	0	a	so then these just become normal coloured buttons , so that might be some some way of cutting the cost .
2392	0	a	Okay , ach that is a shame .
2393	0	a	right ,
2394	0	a	so take away that completely ?
2395	0	a	And now we are under budget .
2396	0	a	So we do have point five Euro to play with if we wanted .
2397	0	a	Does not say so .
2398	0	a	How about with embossing the logo , is not that going to cost us some money ?
2399	0	a	Yeah .
2400	0	a	That is a freebie .
2401	0	a	Yeah .
2402	0	a	Yeah that is a good idea .
2403	0	a	Just one ?
2404	0	a	Does that mean that one button has a special form or
2405	0	a	Yeah okay .
2406	0	a	I think there is just one button so
2407	0	a	handy .
2408	0	a	Well well there we go .
2409	1	a	So I am just going to have to redraw this now .
2410	0	a	So we are not going to have the LCD anymore , and we will just going to have an on t on the TV it will show you what you are doing ,
2411	0	a	which I think is fair enough ,
2412	0	a	and so this is going to be one big thing here .
2413	0	a	Was the goal in your in your prototype design that it be as low profile as possible ?
2414	0	a	Sort of flat as possible .
2415	0	a	What do you mean by profile ?
2416	0	a	No .
2417	0	a	Yeah .
2418	0	a	You see I envision it as being quite deep sort of deep enough to be comfy to hold in your hands rather than being wide and flat .
2419	0	a	Yeah .
2420	0	a	Yeah
2421	0	a	that is what I was thinking , to
2422	0	a	Sure , okay .
2423	0	a	We did not have enough Play Doh to make it three D .
2424	0	a	Yeah alright yeah fair enough .
2425	0	a	Okay , just thought I would ask .
2426	0	a	So there is one more dimension to the thing which we need to to add ,
2427	1	a	and you might want to add in the report ,
2428	0	a	length , width , and height .
2429	0	a	Right okay .
2430	0	a	Yeah .
2431	0	a	So just to well to be thorough then ,
2432	0	a	width wise we are looking at about what three centimetres or something ?
2433	0	a	Okay
2434	0	a	and then so height wise
2435	1	a	How how tall do you envisage it being ?
2436	0	a	About that big ?
2437	0	a	About two centimetres , okay .
2438	0	a	Yeah .
2439	0	a	Yeah it works , yeah .
2440	1	a	Two .
2441	0	a	Two is not very high at all though .
2442	1	a	Maybe a bit higher ?
2443	0	a	Yeah .
2444	0	a	This is about this is about two .
2445	0	a	Slightly more than two , so
2446	0	a	Okay .
2447	0	a	See , about that thick .
2448	0	a	Okay .
2449	1	a	Maybe closer to three even or two and a half .
2450	0	a	Ach , that is
2451	0	a	Yeah .
2452	0	a	Okay we will s we will say two point five .
2453	0	a	Okay
2454	0	a	so we have it within cost anyway .
2455	0	a	so yeah
2456	0	a	project evaluation is this point .
2457	0	a	Right .
2458	1	a	Okay so can we close that ?
2459	0	a	This is what it is the final spec that it is going to be .
2460	1	a	Someone is going to have to
2461	0	a	yeah that is fine that is fine .
2462	0	a	it is probably just
2463	0	a	I dunno if it is worth getting into ,
2464	1	a	but just in in that we want this to be stylish , should we think a little bit more out of the box in terms of a button grid ,
2465	0	a	because I have seen there is lots of devices out there that that instead of taking your standard nine nine square grid , and they have it sort of stylized or in different concept that that
2466	0	a	Yeah .
2467	0	a	I think that is something that is very hard to catch ,
2468	0	a	so you you restrict the number of people who want to try something .
2469	0	a	Sure , okay .
2470	0	a	The the look and the colour is something which is cool , but I think that there is also that factor of if it is too unfamiliar
2471	0	a	then because when you put it on the shelf
2472	0	a	Yeah
2473	1	a	button shape might be a good idea to change , rather than rather than positioning ,
2474	0	a	cause I think positioning is we are kind of engrained into the the telephone kind of pad .
2475	0	a	Yeah , alright .
2476	0	a	Okay , sure .
2477	1	a	What about button shape ?
2478	0	a	Square buttons ?
2479	0	a	Okay .
2480	0	a	Yeah .
2481	0	a	Sure .
2482	0	a	Yeah .
2483	0	a	Yeah .
2484	0	a	Okay .
2485	0	a	Right .
2486	0	a	So at this point we ,
2487	0	a	let me see ,
2488	0	a	discuss how satisfied we all are with with these four points , with the room for creativity in the project , and leadership and teamwork , and the stuff we had around us
2489	0	a	I guess .
2490	0	a	kay .
2491	0	a	let me see
2492	0	a	Yeah I was not really sure
2493	0	a	what that was
2494	0	a	Yeah
2495	1	a	, yeah go for that first .
2496	0	a	Do you want me to d
2497	0	a	Do you want me to do my design evaluation last ?
2498	0	a	Or
2499	0	a	Evaluation .
2500	1	a	Maybe we should do the design evaluation first .
2501	0	a	I was not entirely sure what who was supposed to be doing that ,
2502	1	a	but y you go for it .
2503	0	a	Okay .
2504	0	a	Sure .
2505	0	a	, alright so the way this works , I am going to need to plug into PowerPoint ,
2506	1	a	I will try and do it as quick as possible .
2507	0	a	Okay .
2508	0	a	Okay .
2509	0	a	, this is
2510	1	a	I will just go over your head
2511	0	a	if that is okay .
2512	0	a	Yeah .
2513	0	a	I do not think you need the power ,
2514	0	a	so
2515	0	a	No , that is okay
2516	0	a	that is okay .
2517	0	a	What is that ?
2518	0	a	I do not need the PowerPoint ?
2519	0	a	Oh course ,
2520	0	a	yeah
2521	0	a	that is true .
2522	0	a	No , the power cord itself .
2523	0	a	Yeah ,
2524	0	a	so then you have a bit more freedom to You
2525	0	a	you still have your blue fingers .
2526	1	a	Let me get that .
2527	0	a	A bit more .
2528	0	a	Okay ,
2529	0	a	so what this is is a set up for us to use a kind of a like a
2530	0	a	The idea is that I have set up
2531	0	a	I have reviewed all of the the points of discussion from the beginning , and used that as a criteria of evaluation for the for the current design th or the plan ,
2532	1	a	and so we can review that .
2533	0	a	Is it ?
2534	0	a	Yeah .
2535	0	a	You killed a monster .
2536	0	a	I think it is going to end up being sort of elementary because we are sort we are in
2537	0	a	n we are not going to probably use it to change anything
2538	0	a	but
2539	0	a	Does not seem like it is going , does it ?
2540	0	a	Yeah , okay great .
2541	0	a	Oh there it is .
2542	1	a	and I am going to write up our results on the board ,
2543	1	a	so this will be a way for us to go through and decide if we are sort of review where we stand with it .
2544	0	a	Okay , so
2545	0	a	So to sort of b bring together two things , sort of design goals and also the market research that we had , when we rate this , one is v high in in succeeding or fitting to our original aim and seven is low ,
2546	0	a	okay .
2547	0	a	kay .
2548	0	a	So these i
2549	0	a	these i th are the
2550	0	a	and we have been asked to to collectively rate this ,
2551	1	a	so what we can do is try and just y work on a consensus system
2552	1	a	so we just come to an agreement .
2553	0	a	Okay .
2554	0	a	Okay ?
2555	0	a	So the first one , stylish look and feel .
2556	0	a	I rate that pretty highly .
2557	0	a	Well yeah , I mean compared to most remote controls you see that is pretty good .
2558	0	a	Yeah .
2559	0	a	I dunno like a six or something .
2560	0	a	Yeah .
2561	0	a	Yeah
2562	0	a	me my only reservation with it was that we basically went with yellow because it is the company is colour ,
2563	0	a	and I do not know if yellow is going to really be a hit .
2564	0	a	What does anybody else think ?
2565	0	a	But
2566	0	a	What do you guys think ?
2567	0	a	Okay .
2568	0	a	Okay .
2569	0	a	I am seeing five then .
2570	0	a	I would say five or six .
2571	0	a	David ?
2572	0	a	Okay .
2573	0	a	Yep I am fine with that .
2574	1	a	Okay let is go with five then .
2575	0	a	Fi oh just actually the opposite .
2576	0	a	It is one to seven , right ?
2577	0	a	Wait ,
2578	0	a	what is the scale , one to seven , right ?
2579	0	a	Okay ,
2580	0	a	it is upside down .
2581	0	a	The
2582	0	a	So it meant three , okay .
2583	0	a	Oh yes
2584	0	a	sorry then
2585	0	a	, then I would say two or three .
2586	0	a	One is high ish is not it ?
2587	0	a	, okay
2588	0	a	so yeah , two or three .
2589	0	a	Yeah .
2590	0	a	Yeah , one is high .
2591	0	a	Kay
2592	1	a	Let is go with two point five then .
2593	0	a	Okay ,
2594	0	a	control
2595	0	a	high tech innovation .
2596	0	a	Well it has the wee jog dial
2597	0	a	but
2598	0	a	We had to remove
2599	0	a	Yeah ,
2600	0	a	so we have had to remove a few of our features we wanted ,
2601	0	a	but jog dial is good .
2602	0	a	I would go with three or four , maybe three .
2603	0	a	Say it is more medium , but going towards a little bit higher than medium kind of thing .
2604	0	a	Eight three .
2605	0	a	Okay ,
2606	0	a	three ?
2607	0	a	Okay ,
2608	0	a	Style reflects a fruit inspired colour , design .
2609	0	a	Yeah about three , okay .
2610	0	a	Yep .
2611	0	a	I should not have said colour , but just
2612	0	a	Sorta .
2613	0	a	Lemon .
2614	0	a	Well that is kind of
2615	1	a	But the yellow , I mean it could be a lemon yellow colour ,
2616	0	a	could not it ?
2617	0	a	Yeah .
2618	0	a	Okay , the blue the blue colours and do not re do not actually represent the colour , except for the b the the red button ,
2619	0	a	they because for want of a
2620	0	a	Yeah ,
2621	0	a	the the yellow is more representative of the colour , but the button itself , the blue can be anything else .
2622	0	a	Yeah .
2623	0	a	Yeah .
2624	0	a	Okay .
2625	0	a	Right .
2626	0	a	Yeah , could be .
2627	0	a	Yeah .
2628	0	a	Okay .
2629	0	a	Okay
2630	1	a	so we will go two .
2631	0	a	Yeah ?
2632	0	a	Okay ,
2633	0	a	and design is simple to use , simple in features .
2634	0	a	Well yeah ,
2635	0	a	I mean it is really basic looking
2636	0	a	is not it ?
2637	0	a	I mean I would give that nearly a one .
2638	0	a	F f
2639	0	a	yeah
2640	0	a	f fairly basic ,
2641	0	a	you guys think ?
2642	0	a	Yeah , one ?
2643	0	a	Okay .
2644	0	a	Yeah one .
2645	0	a	Yep , that is fine .
2646	0	a	, soft and spongy , have we achieved that ?
2647	0	a	We have used mostly plastic in the end
2648	0	a	so it is going to be quite a bit of a compromise for price .
2649	0	a	Yeah I think it is about five .
2650	0	a	Five ?
2651	0	a	That is
2652	0	a	could we have used an entirely rubber frame to it ?
2653	0	a	Was that an option ?
2654	0	a	It would cost more than plastic .
2655	0	a	Five ?
2656	0	a	That is really low .
2657	0	a	Yeah well we have to use plastic
2658	0	a	so it is probably going to be
2659	0	a	I think I would probably increase the cost .
2660	0	a	Yeah I suppose kay .
2661	0	a	Yeah ,
2662	0	a	company logo .
2663	0	a	I think it will be cost prohibitive ,
2664	0	a	yeah .
2665	0	a	We have only got like what , ten cents left
2666	0	a	so
2667	0	a	Yeah .
2668	0	a	Okay ,
2669	0	a	logo , we have got it in there , have not we ?
2670	0	a	Huh .
2671	0	a	Yep .
2672	0	a	Yep .
2673	0	a	Gonna have that on the side , are not we ,
2674	0	a	like there or something ?
2675	0	a	Out of forty nine , I guess .
2676	0	a	And it is within budget , yep .
2677	0	a	It is , is not it ?
2678	0	a	Okay ,
2679	0	a	so we can say then that out of a possible
2680	0	a	or what would be our goal here ?
2681	0	a	Yeah ,
2682	0	a	out of forty nine with with zero being the highest .
2683	0	a	We are at two , seven , eight , ten , fifteen point five .
2684	0	a	Is pretty good .
2685	0	a	So it is pretty good .
2686	0	a	Translates to something like about approximately seventy two percent efficacy of our original goal .
2687	0	a	Right ?
2688	0	a	I think cause if you turn that into a hundred it would be about about thirty one , and then invert that , it is
2689	0	a	Oh right , about seventy , yeah seventy percent .
2690	0	a	yeah .
2691	0	a	Twice that , about thirty one .
2692	0	a	So yeah ab
2693	0	a	well yeah about sixty nine , seventy percent
2694	0	a	yeah .
2695	0	a	It is pretty good .
2696	0	a	Okay , good .
2697	0	a	That was just a little formality for us to go through .
2698	0	a	Okay .
2699	0	a	Yep , oh
2700	0	a	hundred pound pen .
2701	0	a	Sorry
2702	0	a	alright .
2703	0	a	Nobody saw it , honestly .
2704	0	a	No .
2705	0	a	The cameras did .
2706	0	a	Is that you all have all finished , or
2707	0	a	Uh huh .
2708	0	a	Yeah that is that is me .
2709	0	a	I did have one other one other frame I thought , I mean
2710	0	a	I I d not knowing how we would deal with this information , I thought okay in theory this kind of a process would be about refining our design , revisiting our original goals .
2711	0	a	It is not something I need to p push through , but I thought should we thinking more about the dimensions , sort of like more of a three dimensional shapes as well as opposed to just that flat
2712	1	a	Could our design involve a series of colours so that it is more of like a line where we have like sort of the , I do not know like the harvest line or the vibrant ,
2713	0	a	I dunno the
2714	0	a	Whatever
2715	1	a	just some theme
2716	1	a	and then we have different tones , lime green , lemon .
2717	0	a	Yep .
2718	0	a	Okay .
2719	0	a	It is just discussion .
2720	1	a	I mean obviously we can just abandon this ,
2721	0	a	it is fine .
2722	0	a	I am just thinking about what we originally set out to do .
2723	0	a	, yep
2724	0	a	so there .
2725	0	a	Right .
2726	0	a	That is all .
2727	0	a	Okay , great
2728	0	a	are you submitting the the evaluation criteria or am I ?
2729	0	a	I do not know what your instructions have been .
2730	0	a	, I think to record it
2731	0	a	and I have not been asked to submit it yet .
2732	0	a	Yeah .
2733	0	a	Okay ,
2734	0	a	just wondering if I need to include it in the minutes , because if you are submitting it anyway then
2735	0	a	Okay great .
2736	0	a	I will , yeah .
2737	0	a	It keeps getting too big .
2738	0	a	Cool
2739	0	a	right ,
2740	0	a	well next up then , because we have done finance , is the project evaluation .
2741	0	a	Kay I am I am listening I am just trying to incorporate the logo into the the thing , so I am playing with the Play Doh as well .
2742	0	a	Oh right
2743	0	a	, okay .
2744	0	a	Just in case you are wondering , why is he still playing with the Play Doh ?
2745	0	a	Just about right
2746	0	a	LEGO Lego .
2747	0	a	Huh .
2748	0	a	My leg .
2749	0	a	Right , okay .
2750	1	a	well do you want to just individually say what you think about about these four points and
2751	0	a	or not those four points , my four points ,
2752	0	a	sorry ,
2753	0	a	forgotten that .
2754	0	a	You got a different
2755	0	a	Oh yeah , they are good are not they ,
2756	0	a	yeah .
2757	0	a	Yep .
2758	0	a	I like those printer cables that just have the two little butterfly clips like that .
2759	0	a	It is really quick .
2760	0	a	Right okay ,
2761	0	a	yeah here we are .
2762	0	a	To use .
2763	0	a	as a note we will do this alphabetically .
2764	1	a	do you want to start Andrew ?
2765	0	a	I do not know ,
2766	0	a	just your opinion on those four those four points really and how we used them .
2767	0	a	Sure ,
2768	0	a	so what is it you are asking of me now ?
2769	0	a	Or sort of our work on setting this up .
2770	0	a	Yeah .
2771	0	a	Yeah .
2772	0	a	Well , is it
2773	1	a	okay I will just go through your system then .
2774	0	a	The the room is fairly institutional , but the main thing is , I think our use of this space is more just to report on things as opposed to be creative and constructive and it would probably help to have l sort of a cumulative effect of we have ideas
2775	0	a	and we come back
2776	0	a	and then the ideas are still in discussion , you know , as in other words this this room is sort of a centre point of creativity , whereas in reality as we have gone through this , it is not really the centre point of creativity
2777	0	a	, it is
2778	0	a	more just a d debating
2779	0	a	Yeah , yeah
2780	0	a	but that is just
2781	0	a	the thing is the quest in terms of the the first point there , the room , it feels as though the creativity goes on when we leave , and then we come here and then we kind of put out our ideas and then , you know .
2782	0	a	Uh huh .
2783	0	a	Well d do you feel though that that you were able to have quite a lot of creative input into the thing ?
2784	0	a	But I do not I do not think it means the room as in this room .
2785	0	a	I think it means like you know
2786	0	a	Yeah .
2787	0	a	Oh , oh right right ,
2788	0	a	oh right
2789	0	a	okay room for creativ
2790	0	a	Oh right I just looked up and saw okay whiteboard , digital pens , the room .
2791	0	a	Room .
2792	0	a	Oh yeah .
2793	0	a	No , of course
2794	0	a	, yeah .
2795	0	a	Well I dunno
2796	0	a	do you th
2797	0	a	I think it means I think it means did you feel you were able to give creative input so
2798	0	a	Sorry .
2799	0	a	Huh .
2800	0	a	Yeah .
2801	0	a	Yeah
2802	0	a	I th okay on th
2803	0	a	yeah
2804	0	a	dif
2805	0	a	answering the question in those terms I would say that actually there is sort of a tease of creativity because we are asked to work through this , but actually the guidelines are fairly contrived in terms of okay fashion trends , say fruit and vegetable colour scheme , but then i then we are told okay use the co company company colours .
2806	0	a	So what do we do .
2807	0	a	We are told okay think in terms of style and look and feel and technology , but build something for twelve and a half pounds , so actually the creativity was more more of like a a f sort of a f formality then
2808	0	a	an actual
2809	0	a	Yeah within the constraints
2810	0	a	the
2811	0	a	Yeah .
2812	0	a	Okay .
2813	0	a	You feel like you are caged within whatever
2814	0	a	y
2815	0	a	It is like a balloon in a cage , it can only go so big and not hit the side .
2816	0	a	Okay .
2817	0	a	The constraints do come in very fast .
2818	0	a	Yeah ,
2819	0	a	yeah .
2820	0	a	Okay do you know what ,
2821	1	a	actually let is take each point and everybody discuss it , I think .
2822	0	a	So
2823	0	a	Yeah .
2824	0	a	Yeah .
2825	0	a	So still on the topic of room for creativity next up is Craig .
2826	0	a	I agree with his point
2827	0	a	it is it is quite a lot of fun t to go
2828	0	a	and then you have sort of hit the end
2829	0	a	then go right , gotta cut everything out cause we do not have enough money .
2830	0	a	Yeah .
2831	0	a	Yeah .
2832	0	a	Yep .
2833	0	a	I think another point is that the meetings are more brainstorming sessions than meetings , so time is also a very s strong factor , and structure .
2834	0	a	Yeah .
2835	0	a	Yeah .
2836	0	a	Yeah .
2837	0	a	Because for a brainstorming meeting you want a structure that allows you to allows ideas to get tossed , to be evaluated , and to be reviewed , and to get feedback and come back .
2838	0	a	Yeah ,
2839	0	a	yeah .
2840	0	a	And I guess that point about the room not being r very friendly to that
2841	0	a	, I think that is a very big thing , and I think the fact that we are wearing these things restricts
2842	0	a	I feel it cause I wear m my glasses , right , and that
2843	0	a	but that irritates me
2844	0	a	right it
2845	0	a	it
2846	0	a	it does actually you know affect how , w whether you feel comfortable to communicate .
2847	0	a	Yeah .
2848	0	a	Yeah , sure .
2849	0	a	Yeah .
2850	0	a	Yeah .
2851	0	a	New creativity .
2852	0	a	I feel like I am hiding behind the equipment , rather than the equipment is helping me , and you know .
2853	0	a	Yep .
2854	0	a	Right .
2855	0	a	So you think a more relaxed atmosphere would be more kind of conducive to creative thought or
2856	0	a	Yeah ,
2857	0	a	but actual environment ?
2858	0	a	Okay .
2859	0	a	Not not so much an atmosphere ,
2860	0	a	the atmosphere is very relaxed ,
2861	0	a	but the the gear
2862	0	a	yeah
2863	0	a	you know that creates boundaries to that and and the time the time given also restricts
2864	0	a	Excuse me .
2865	0	a	Okay .
2866	0	a	Very good .
2867	0	a	what about leadership ?
2868	0	a	I do not know if that means like , if I did a good job or something .
2869	0	a	I do not really know .
2870	0	a	Yeah , well well
2871	0	a	I mean
2872	0	a	my sense on that is sort of what kind of guidance and direction , encouragement
2873	0	a	Yeah from
2874	0	a	and you as well
2875	0	a	I think , just sort of acting as team leader .
2876	0	a	From like your personal coach person and stuff like that , do you think maybe ?
2877	0	a	Okay .
2878	0	a	yeah
2879	0	a	I think I think it is
2880	0	a	I think it is good .
2881	0	a	I mean my personal views on on leadership is that effective effective leadership sort of gives people a certain room for freedom and delegation , but then to come back with something that they take great ownership
2882	0	a	and you know , innovative thought with .
2883	0	a	In in reality I think here the the different elements of leadership such as the the original b briefing and then the personal coach and the
2884	0	a	and then you know having having you with your the meeting agenda is actually quite a quite a quite a con confining framework to work within .
2885	0	a	And so it is leadership almost to the point of sort of disempowering the the the team member ,
2886	0	a	so But it is not bad leadership
2887	0	a	, it is just sort of s fairly strong , you know .
2888	0	a	Uh huh , okay .
2889	0	a	It turns it turns the individual into more of like a sort of a predetermined mechanism , as opposed to a sort of a free
2890	0	a	Yeah ,
2891	0	a	oh yeah , without without a doubt .
2892	0	a	So you think maybe a little too controlling or
2893	0	a	Okay .
2894	0	a	I think controlling is not the right word , I think the interactions are very structured .
2895	0	a	Yeah maybe not co confining .
2896	0	a	I think structure is probably what you are saying that , each individual is structured to one particular task , and one parti rather than controlling .
2897	0	a	Yeah .
2898	0	a	Yeah ,
2899	0	a	yeah .
2900	0	a	I do not think there is a sense of control cause all the decisions have been made in terms of a , like a consensus right , we go around and we think about it , but that you know process actually says you have to do it in a certain way .
2901	0	a	Uh huh .
2902	0	a	Okay .
2903	0	a	It does not tell you , you know , some ways that you might want to be a bit more creative in terms of the process you know , not the I think you tried to use the common share folder to to to to communicate , but it just comes back to us so slow in the email
2904	0	a	it
2905	0	a	it does not have a , you know , a messenger will go .
2906	0	a	Yeah .
2907	0	a	Okay ,
2908	0	a	what about teamwork ?
2909	0	a	Yeah .
2910	0	a	did , you want to comment Craig ?
2911	0	a	Yeah .
2912	0	a	, reckon that was a bit hard because we could only discuss things in the meeting .
2913	0	a	If we could just go up to somebody outside the meeting and have a quick talk with them , that would have been a lot easier .
2914	0	a	Yeah .
2915	0	a	Okay .
2916	0	a	Fully agree .
2917	0	a	Yeah .
2918	0	a	Did did you guys get the email I sent you ?
2919	0	a	Oh that is alright .
2920	0	a	Yeah .
2921	0	a	Not just yet .
2922	0	a	Yeah .
2923	0	a	Yeah , got the email .
2924	0	a	I was wondering if that got there
2925	0	a	okay .
2926	0	a	Okay .
2927	0	a	Okay , so to s to
2928	0	a	to summarize the teamwork issue , saying that if we could communicate outside the meeting , you know just like quick questions , quick thoughts , whatever , it probably would be bit easier .
2929	0	a	Yeah .
2930	0	a	Yeah ,
2931	0	a	in it
2932	0	a	exactly .
2933	0	a	I think the tools that they were given , the tool set that were given to us are fancy but they do not support collaboration , I think that is the word .
2934	0	a	They do not support the team working together , you know , they are still very individual tools .
2935	0	a	Oh right
2936	0	a	, okay .
2937	0	a	Yeah ,
2938	0	a	I mean if you
2939	0	a	Yeah , I mean sort of taking upon that idea , w the way I see this
2940	0	a	i is that it is the the s the structure
2941	0	a	in which we have we have approached this whole task is quite contrary to the p principle of teamwork
2942	0	a	because the the tasks were d d sort of divided , and then the work went on in isolation
2943	0	a	I
2944	0	a	I do not know what you guys did while you were together , maybe that was a bit different ,
2945	0	a	but
2946	0	a	yeah ,
2947	0	a	but but actually if you if you imagine not entire the completely same task given to us
2948	0	a	but us said okay
2949	0	a	, first thing we have to do is come up with let is say a design concept , and we sit here together and do it ,
2950	0	a	well that is what teamwork is .
2951	0	a	We had Play Doh fun .
2952	0	a	Yeah .
2953	0	a	To s to say okay go off and do not talk to each other , it is actually p sort of predisposes you to quite the contrary of teamwork .
2954	0	a	Yeah .
2955	0	a	Okay .
2956	0	a	not that we have not done I think the best we could have done .
2957	0	a	Okay .
2958	0	a	I am not dissatisfied with it .
2959	0	a	Right ,
2960	0	a	anything else to say on teamwork at all ?
2961	0	a	Okay ,
2962	0	a	what about the you know how we used the whiteboard , the digital pens , the projector , stuff like that ?
2963	0	a	did anybody think anything was like really useful , anything was pretty un f unsupportive ?
2964	0	a	No , not really .
2965	0	a	I think the whiteboard , for me , is the kind of thing I would use all the time ,
2966	0	a	but it is not quite as useful as to us as it could have been ,
2967	1	a	maybe just in the way that we we use it , in the sense that once we have an idea out there or while work was going on in between meetings , that could have been up on a board you know as opposed to in like in text .
2968	1	a	, and then we could then keep our ideas sort of building on that .
2969	0	a	I know that people who design cars and you know in aviation they quite often just have a simple like fibreglass prototype and it is completely you know abs abstract from the final product , but they use it as a kind of a context to sort of walk around and puzzle and and point and discuss
2970	0	a	and and
2971	0	a	and in a way everybody is as we discuss things in the in theoretically and out of our notebooks ,
2972	0	a	we are just
2973	0	a	we are actually just each of us discussing something that is in each of our own minds .
2974	0	a	Yeah .
2975	0	a	And point at ?
2976	0	a	Yeah .
2977	0	a	It was not until we had this here , you know , like at one point I peeked across and looked at Craig is paper
2978	0	a	and I am like ,
2979	0	a	now I know what he is thinking cause I saw his book .
2980	0	a	Yeah .
2981	0	a	But the b the b whiteboard could have actually been this kind of continuing
2982	0	a	Think could be , yeah .
2983	0	a	So do you think producing a prototype earlier in the process woulda been a good idea ?
2984	0	a	Yeah .
2985	0	a	I think the the focus of it a lot was the PowerPoint as opposed to the to the whiteboard ,
2986	0	a	and I think that m is also does you know hinder us and things I think .
2987	0	a	Yeah ,
2988	0	a	yeah .
2989	0	a	Yeah .
2990	0	a	Yeah ,
2991	0	a	yeah .
2992	0	a	It will be cooler to have the whiteboard rather than the the PowerPoint , or maybe the whiteboard and the PowerPoint in the same place ,
2993	0	a	you know in the centre of the
2994	0	a	I think that there were too many PowerPoints in the meetings .
2995	0	a	Yeah .
2996	0	a	Yeah ,
2997	0	a	yeah .
2998	0	a	Okay .
2999	0	a	Yeah ,
3000	0	a	because the PowerPoint was provided to us while we had time to prepare , whereas I can imagine if I would been encouraged to use Paintbrush , for example , or whatever , I would have actually used it ,
3001	0	a	'ca you know ,
3002	0	a	just cause that is sorta how we what we were set up to to use while we had our time .
3003	0	a	Alright .
3004	0	a	Okay
3005	0	a	Yeah .
3006	0	a	Yeah .
3007	0	a	Cause the plug in and the plugging spent we spent a lot of time doing that .
3008	0	a	Yeah .
3009	0	a	And a lot of the information on the PowerPoints , I do not think , you know , we needed to actually it could have , we could have gone through it verbally ,
3010	0	a	especially my slides ,
3011	0	a	I felt that they just you know
3012	0	a	as opposed to having to present them .
3013	0	a	Yeah .
3014	0	a	No , not quite .
3015	0	a	Yeah .
3016	0	a	Yeah .
3017	0	a	Okay .
3018	0	a	Yeah .
3019	0	a	What about the digital pens , did you find them easy enough to use ?
3020	0	a	Yeah .
3021	0	a	Oh they are a bit clunky .
3022	0	a	Sure , yeah .
3023	0	a	Yep clunky .
3024	0	a	Agreed .
3025	0	a	Yeah .
3026	0	a	Yep .
3027	0	a	Clunky , okay .
3028	0	a	Yeah .
3029	0	a	Having to tick it before you go off was a bit hindering as well ,
3030	0	a	cause you are half way through a thought , and then you run out of paper and then you have to jump .
3031	0	a	I know ,
3032	0	a	I think at the very start of today I like wrote a whole load of stuff , did not click note on one , then went back and wrote one tiny wee thing on the another page , but then did click note , and so I am quite worried that I have just written over the top of it or something , but they will have my paper anyway and have not done that since .
3033	0	a	Yeah .
3034	0	a	But I think the pen is v is very intuitive , everybody knows how to use it , we do not have to worry .
3035	0	a	Yeah ,
3036	0	a	yeah .
3037	0	a	So I think the pen is good .
3038	0	a	It is about the best thing .
3039	0	a	And o on the topic of the technology , it just occurred to me that we actually did not need to move our computers because each computer has all of the files .
3040	0	a	Yeah .
3041	0	a	It just occurred to me that they all
3042	0	a	We only actually needed one computer .
3043	0	a	Yeah
3044	0	a	we only needed one computer and
3045	0	a	And the computer may not be conducive to a meeting because you tend to look at your computer and want to have the urge to check something , you know ,
3046	0	a	it is useful but I think too many computers are just distracting .
3047	0	a	Yeah , that is true .
3048	0	a	If there had been a fifth , that coulda just been sitting there ready to go the whole time .
3049	0	a	Good point .
3050	0	a	Yeah .
3051	0	a	Yeah .
3052	0	a	Yeah .
3053	0	a	Yeah .
3054	0	a	Do you think the computers just provide distraction in a meeting ?
3055	0	a	Okay .
3056	0	a	Yeah .
3057	0	a	Yep .
3058	0	a	I know I
3059	0	a	I like to have things written down in front of me actually , like a lot of the stuff that was emailed to me
3060	0	a	I ended up you know like writing down there or something
3061	0	a	so I could look at it really quickly and not have the distraction of all of that
3062	0	a	, I do not know about anybody else .
3063	0	a	Yep .
3064	0	a	what else
3065	0	a	any wh I do
3066	0	a	I am not really sure what they are looking for when they say new ideas found .
3067	0	a	I do not know is
3068	0	a	could you think of like anything else that would have been helpful today at all ?
3069	0	a	Is this for the project or
3070	0	a	Oh yeah .
3071	0	a	Well
3072	0	a	, the w main one for me is that the process na in a natural f context would not have been interrupted by this necessity to discommunicate ourselves from each other .
3073	0	a	So ,
3074	0	a	that is kind of a new idea for me is like just sort of that idea ,
3075	0	a	well you know it is kind of s hard to keep f working forward on a team a team based project when when you are told you must now work away from your team .
3076	0	a	Yeah
3077	0	a	if we just had
3078	0	a	Yeah
3079	0	a	I
3080	0	a	I
3081	0	a	dunno
3082	0	a	I think it was quite good that we had time limits on the meetings because they really could have run on
3083	0	a	and like my experience with meetings is that they really do , and you can spend a lot of time talking about
3084	0	a	The only thing is though like when we had our meeting about the conceptual design , I thought there maybe another fifteen minutes would have been useful there
3085	0	a	but yeah .
3086	0	a	Oh yeah .
3087	0	a	Yeah ,
3088	0	a	yeah .
3089	0	a	I really thi
3090	0	a	i
3091	0	a	I think maybe if we would like all been working in the one room , and they just said you know like every hour or something everybody make sure
3092	0	a	yo you know just have a have a short meeting
3093	0	a	and then just c just to have like something written down , just like you know a a milestone if you like rather than having meetings , but
3094	0	a	There you go .
3095	0	a	so in closing ,
3096	0	a	I have not got my five minutes to go .
3097	0	a	Thin
3098	0	a	Oh there it
3099	0	a	i
3100	0	a	Five minutes to go .
3101	0	a	Wonderful .
3102	0	a	Okay
3103	0	a	are the costs within the budget , yes they are .
3104	0	a	And is the project evaluated , yes it is .
3105	0	a	So now celebrate .
3106	0	a	Great .
3107	0	a	So it
3108	0	a	So now we
3109	0	a	I I do not know .
3110	0	a	And we have Ninja Homer .
3111	0	a	Well apparently now I write the final report .
3112	0	a	Do we know what the other ones are ?
3113	0	a	Oh wow .
3114	0	a	What are you guys doing now ?
3115	0	a	You dunno ?
3116	0	a	That is lovely .
3117	0	a	Hey yeah ,
3118	0	a	I said Ninja Homer .
3119	0	a	What did you call it ?
3120	0	a	Huh , huh .
3121	0	a	Ninja Homer .
3122	0	a	See it looks like Homer Simpson but it is electronic so it is made in Japan .
3123	0	a	So is that j is that just is that just a logo or does it do anything ?
3124	0	a	Just a logo
3125	0	a	and then like Ninja Homer ,
3126	0	a	right okay .
3127	0	a	Logo .
3128	0	a	Yeah it is just a logo .
3129	0	a	Huh .
3130	0	a	Ninja Homer .
3131	0	a	The the red is supposed to represent the whatever else you want to print on the side of it .
3132	0	a	I think it is quite nice .
3133	1	a	Fashion technology or something .
3134	0	a	You can wear Homer , you can throw Homer when you are frustrated , doh .
3135	0	a	Oh no , that is cool ,
3136	0	a	it is got
3137	0	a	I am kind of
3138	0	a	I am slightly gutted that we could not get plastic and rubber ,
3139	0	a	I think that would have been nice .
3140	0	a	It is clunky .
3141	0	a	Yeah ,
3142	0	a	yeah .
3143	0	a	well ,
3144	1	a	maybe from now on real reaction should give us more money .
3145	0	a	Oh , I did learn something new , Play Doh is useful .
3146	0	a	Play Doh s
3147	0	a	Really ?
3148	0	a	Yeah .
3149	0	a	No it is it is .
3150	0	a	It is useful and in in in in in in in conceptualizing , in being creative .
3151	0	a	Huh .
3152	0	a	Huh .
3153	0	a	Cause like you say , it is something you can put your hands on and feel and touch and get a sense for .
3154	0	a	Yeah .
3155	0	a	Like we were playing with the Play Doh and the ideas came with the Play Doh rather than with everything else .
3156	0	a	Did they ?
3157	0	a	Okay .
3158	1	a	You might want to write that down .
3159	0	a	Yeah .
3160	0	a	It is just , I am just fiddling with the Play Doh , and I am going
3161	0	a	yeah
3162	0	a	yeah
3163	0	a	it is kind of cool .
3164	0	a	Play Doh .
3165	0	a	No , it is true , yeah .
3166	0	a	Guess I would forgot
3167	0	a	how good s Play Doh smells .
3168	0	a	Yeah , it smells funny does not it .
3169	0	a	And some Play Dohs are actually I think edible
3170	0	a	are not they ?
3171	0	a	Wow , .
3172	0	a	Yeah like the stuff for
3173	0	a	I think it has to be , yeah .
3174	0	a	No , all Play Doh is edible .
3175	0	a	I think they are all non toxic cause it is aimed for like two year olds .
3176	0	a	It is just wheat , it is the stuff that your mom could make with preservatives
3177	0	a	and It is helpful to the creative process .
3178	0	a	Yeah so to
3179	0	a	wha what are your summarising words about Play Doh ?
3180	0	a	Okay .
3181	0	a	Huh .
3182	0	a	it engages all your senses not just your sight , but your sense of feel your sense of touch .
3183	0	a	Yep .
3184	0	a	And it helps you to understand dimension as well .
3185	0	a	Taste .
3186	0	a	I think that that is very helpful because it it starts to pop up ,
3187	0	a	whereas on a piece of paper , on a computer , on a board , even with a three D graphic thing it still , it requires a lot of
3188	0	a	yeah tangible , that is a nice word .
3189	0	a	Yeah .
3190	0	a	Yeah .
3191	0	a	Yeah .
3192	0	a	, yep .
3193	0	a	Yeah .
3194	0	a	Yeah
3195	0	a	Yeah .
3196	0	a	It becomes tangible .
3197	0	a	Tangible .
3198	0	a	Okay
3199	0	a	I do not know if there is anything else we needed to discuss .
3200	0	a	Nope .
3201	0	a	That that is about it really .
3202	1	a	Just sit still I guess for a little while .
3203	0	a	Do we retreat to our , to continue our
3204	1	a	I think we could probably do it here as long as we do not collaborate .
3205	0	a	Well I dunno .
3206	0	a	I am sure the little the little thing will pop up any minute now .
3207	0	a	 
3208	0	a	Okay , well
3209	1	a	I think we are ready to begin .
3210	0	a	Right ,
3211	0	a	my name is Adam Duguid , we are here because of real reaction ,
3212	0	a	, we have in the group
3213	0	a	, yeah ,
3214	1	a	go for it mate .
3215	0	a	Oh ,
3216	0	a	Ebenezer Ademesoye .
3217	0	a	Would you like me to spell that ?
3218	0	a	S
3219	0	a	, NEZ ER .
3220	0	a	N E Z .
3221	0	a	Ebenezer .
3222	0	a	And your role is ?
3223	0	a	You are the Marketing Expert , okay .
3224	0	a	I am the Marketing Expert .
3225	0	a	Next we have ?
3226	0	a	T R I K .
3227	0	a	Tarik Rahman .
3228	0	a	TARIK .
3229	0	a	And your role in this is ?
3230	0	a	Industrial Designer .
3231	0	a	Industrial Designer .
3232	0	a	And , lastly we have ?
3233	0	a	And you are going to be the User Interface ,
3234	0	a	is it ?
3235	0	a	Designer .
3236	0	a	, Dave Cochrane .
3237	0	a	User Interface Defin Designer , yes .
3238	0	a	Okay .
3239	0	a	Right .
3240	0	a	This is the agenda for today is meeting .
3241	0	a	As you can see , w opening , acquaintance , tool training , project plan discussion , and closing .
3242	0	a	, we already got n through opening , and partially through acquaintance .
3243	0	a	So ,
3244	0	a	the reason we are here , we are going to design a new remote control , as you probably all know .
3245	0	a	The very broad overview is original , trendy , and user friendly .
3246	1	a	Course , we will have to go into a bit more detail than that ,
3247	0	a	but personally I think that the original is going to be a very key aspect to this design .
3248	0	a	, there is a lot of remote controls out there anyway ,
3249	1	a	so we are going to need something that is really going to set it apart .
3250	0	a	This is how today seems to be going to work .
3251	0	a	We are going to have the three kay phases , as you have probably already been told , the functional , architectural , and the detailed design .
3252	0	a	First one is going to be covering the user requirement spec , technical functions , working design .
3253	0	a	Second seems to be conceptual components , properties , materials , and the last one is a detailed analysis of our design so far .
3254	0	a	Of course , you have all got the similar emails , I believe ,
3255	0	a	right .
3256	0	a	What can I say ?
3257	0	a	Ebenezer , you want to have a you want to draw your favourite animal ?
3258	0	a	Brilliantly done .
3259	0	a	Sure .
3260	0	a	Whiteboard .
3261	0	a	Kay .
3262	0	a	S
3263	0	a	okay .
3264	1	a	I will make this quick ,
3265	0	a	since we do not have much time .
3266	0	a	Kay , so
3267	0	a	it is not the best picture in the world .
3268	0	a	Here we have an elephant .
3269	0	a	First point , begins with an E , same like Ebenezer .
3270	0	a	Also , elephants have a very good memory , much like myself , and I ca not remember back when I used to live back in Nigeria , but I think I used to have a pet elephant .
3271	0	a	So
3272	0	a	elephants are big , strong and gentle , and they have great memories , and they begin with the letter E , just like Ebenezer .
3273	0	a	Thank you .
3274	0	a	Thank you .
3275	0	a	Tarik , would you like to have a shot at a bit of artistry ?
3276	0	a	Oh , ,
3277	1	a	you can clip them to your belt .
3278	0	a	Oh .
3279	0	a	Oh oh
3280	0	a	I think you ga The little
3281	0	a	The the
3282	0	a	Oh that is good ,
3283	0	a	we can clip them on .
3284	0	a	Do we take them off ?
3285	0	a	Oh right ,
3286	0	a	okay .
3287	1	a	You should also l have your the lapel mic on as well .
3288	0	a	Ah ha .
3289	0	a	Okay .
3290	0	a	Yeah ,
3291	1	a	Just somewhere
3292	0	a	I think so .
3293	0	a	Now
3294	1	a	where do I put the
3295	0	a	Is this supposed to be clipped as well ?
3296	0	a	, destroying your elephant here .
3297	0	a	Yep ,
3298	0	a	the , it is just across there ,
3299	0	a	that is it .
3300	0	a	Yep .
3301	0	a	Yeah .
3302	0	a	It will follow you
3303	0	a	if you
3304	1	a	You can probably just stick it in your pocket for now ,
3305	0	a	I would not worry too much .
3306	0	a	Yeah .
3307	0	a	There you go .
3308	0	a	Should have good range .
3309	0	a	, here we have a tiger .
3310	0	a	I have always loved tigers .
3311	0	a	They are just
3312	0	a	they are big , they are biggest cats , I did a project on cats in the wild when I was a kid
3313	0	a	and it was my favourite cat , just cause it was looks the best , the stripes , orange .
3314	0	a	My dad used to talk about he is from Bangladesh so he used to tell me all about them
3315	0	a	when he was
3316	0	a	when I was a kid .
3317	0	a	And they are just the most feared of of animals in the wild .
3318	0	a	So
3319	0	a	that is why I like them .
3320	0	a	Did not say an anything about me really
3321	0	a	but
3322	0	a	Excellent , thank you very much .
3323	1	a	Dave , if you would like to have a dash .
3324	0	a	, the monkey , .
3325	0	a	The one f
3326	0	a	in fact this is a somewhat oblique reference
3327	0	a	in fact to
3328	0	a	well
3329	0	a	my
3330	0	a	I have a three three y year old daughter who h who who who is affectionately known as Miss Monkey .
3331	0	a	, monkeys have attitude .
3332	0	a	Which I think is a good thing .
3333	0	a	And I mean fr and from from the point of view of sort of the study of human evolution they and other primates are terribly interesting .
3334	0	a	, so I like monkeys .
3335	0	a	And and th th th th thi thi this one seems to have perhaps more attitude than most .
3336	0	a	Cheers .
3337	0	a	Hardly what I would call the best drawing in the world but it will do for now .
3338	0	a	Also not quite as feared as your average tiger ,
3339	0	a	but cats are one of my favourite animals ,
3340	0	a	they are very independent , they are snotty as hell at the best of times ,
3341	0	a	and , what can you say , you got to love those qualities in an animal .
3342	0	a	Right .
3343	0	a	I think we have all managed to master the whiteboard there by looks of it ,
3344	0	a	so ,
3345	1	a	on to it .
3346	0	a	Project finance .
3347	0	a	As you can see , twelve point five Euros per unit .
3348	0	a	That is not a terrible lot as far as I am aware ,
3349	0	a	and we are hoping to sell them for twenty five .
3350	0	a	If we are aiming for fifty million Euros we are going to have to be selling an awful lot of them .
3351	0	a	Oh ,
3352	0	a	that was profiting , that was an amount , so that is the amount made ,
3353	0	a	okay .
3354	0	a	Yep .
3355	0	a	Well ,
3356	0	a	fifty million , and if you are making twelve point five Euros on each one , then , awful lot need to be sold .
3357	0	a	Yeah .
3358	0	a	Okay .
3359	1	a	Now we better actually just get on with the the meat of the project .
3360	0	a	So
3361	0	a	I am going to guess that we have all used remote controls .
3362	1	a	Any ideas of where you think a new remote control could go into this market ?
3363	0	a	Okay .
3364	0	a	Well ,
3365	0	a	one thing I am aware of is , th there at the sort of v very high price end of the market there is there is a em emerging market for sort of touch screen LCD remotes that can be programmed in m much more sophisticated ways than sort of conventional models ,
3366	0	a	so you get the sort of you get you
3367	0	a	you can redesign the interface to your own needs , you can programme in macros ,
3368	0	a	and you get a much greater degree
3369	0	a	I mean you get in these sort of three in one , five in one , whatevers , but you can get integration between the different the the the diff the different things that it is designed to control , to a much greater extent , and you can have one you know one macro to turn
3370	0	a	the you know turn the TV to the right channel , get the re rewind the tape in the VCR and get it to play once it is rewound , for instance .
3371	1	a	b it occurs to me there might be a niche for for a remote that aimed towards some of that sort of functionality but using a just conventional push button design .
3372	0	a	And therefore putting it into a well much lower price bracket .
3373	0	a	Okay ,
3374	0	a	yeah ,
3375	0	a	tha that is true ,
3376	0	a	with the price range we are looking at , going for a touch screen would probably be possibly out of our
3377	0	a	yeah .
3378	0	a	Absolutely prohibitive ,
3379	0	a	yeah .
3380	0	a	Oh .
3381	0	a	But you think again something to control multiple units in a simple fashion .
3382	0	a	Yeah ,
3383	0	a	I mean I would not like to say you g
3384	0	a	I mean you get ones that you can switch between multiple units ,
3385	1	a	but something that could operate between multiple units in a more integrated fashion .
3386	0	a	Some
3387	1	a	and ideally something into which it would have some at least limited facility for running macros .
3388	0	a	Would the the idea something along the lines of , one on button would turn on say the video recorder , the TV , maybe the sound system as well , all in one go , is that kind of
3389	0	a	Okay , that sounds like a a good strong idea .
3390	0	a	For instance ,
3391	0	a	let is say
3392	0	a	oh oh , or you know
3393	1	a	you pr you press say the play button for the DVD player and it turns the TV on and onto the right channel as well ,
3394	0	a	Kay
3395	0	a	Well
3396	0	a	I have noticed that gaming c is becoming quite popular with television , when I was younger we used to e play games using our cable , using the cable subscribed the cable providers , but our remote controls would get worn out really easily ,
3397	0	a	and the remote control was not a great kind of keyboar , keypad , for playing games .
3398	0	a	Any takes on this ?
3399	0	a	Okay .
3400	1	a	So perhaps one that was more specialised for game playing or interactive television .
3401	0	a	They they have recently brought out this new remote control , for people to set their favourite channels , or to record things .
3402	0	a	Instead of people entering in what time things start , you simply stri slide a bar to say what time it begins , and slide another bar to say what time it ends ,
3403	0	a	you know that is
3404	0	a	Yeah ,
3405	0	a	it is it is taken out the
3406	0	a	Y you do not have to be really clever to use a remote control .
3407	0	a	Okay .
3408	0	a	Yeah
3409	0	a	I have heard
3410	0	a	I have seen the bar code design before ,
3411	0	a	yeah .
3412	1	a	I think for gaming , you know you want you want some big buttons for up , down , left and right , shoot .
3413	0	a	, you want to be able to change angles in interactive television ,
3414	1	a	so you need buttons to change the television angle , the camera angles and stuff like that .
3415	0	a	Okay , well
3416	0	a	we are beginning to run out of time now ,
3417	0	a	so ,
3418	0	a	we have got a couple of ideas ,
3419	0	a	we can
3420	1	a	we will have to work fast ,
3421	0	a	, alright
3422	0	a	as you can see we have got thirty minutes until the next meeting , so we will have to try and decide on some of the basic functionality , , how the user interface might work , that will be a key aspect especially if the idea of some kind of macros facility because you have to program it ,
3423	1	a	you have to have a lot of response back , or at least some kind .
3424	0	a	Kay .
3425	0	a	Yeah .
3426	1	a	And we are going to maybe n try and have to figure out
3427	0	a	what the user wants , yes .
3428	1	a	What the user wants .
3429	0	a	Okay .
3430	0	a	, right .
3431	1	a	Has anybody got anything they would like to add at this stage , anything they think that might have been missed so far ?
3432	0	a	I I do not see why not ,
3433	0	a	almost everybody is probably used to a console by now , and all of them incorporate small keypads on them , in fact even the mobile phones these days are beginning to use them as well , so it is probably an interface that most people are used to .
3434	0	a	Well
3435	0	a	when you are talking about gaming and stuff ,
3436	0	a	do you think they should have some sort of stick on it , rather than buttons ?
3437	1	a	Like control pads , you know of games ,
3438	0	a	but
3439	0	a	or is that a bit ridiculous ?
3440	0	a	Yeah .
3441	0	a	Oh .
3442	0	a	Okay , .
3443	0	a	and that could allow n easy navigation , used as a joystick as well .
3444	1	a	The other key feature that that would be a good idea built into it is t is is to make something you know fairly sort of ergonomic , something that just fits fits as comfortably as possible into the hand .
3445	1	a	But of course , al al also allows for the possibility of a more sort of slightly unconventional or attractive sha shape for it overall , .
3446	0	a	Okay .
3447	0	a	So ,
3448	0	a	small , stylish , and something that is just a little different .
3449	0	a	A curve ,
3450	0	a	Okay .
3451	0	a	That is definitely something that we should be able to do quite easily .
3452	0	a	I would I would have hoped so anyway .
3453	0	a	, right .
3454	1	a	I would say we finish this one up , we get started ,
3455	0	a	I will get in ,
3456	1	a	I will write up what we have kind of quickly done , and I will get that out to everybody .
3457	0	a	Kay .
3458	0	a	Yeah ?
3459	0	a	Okay .
3460	0	a	So .
3461	0	a	 
3462	1	a	Just put it on the deskt desktop .
3463	0	a	No
3464	0	a	on the desktop you will find you should find that there is a project documents link .
3465	0	a	A
3466	0	a	well
3467	0	a	actually just there .
3468	0	a	Project documents ,
3469	0	a	yeah .
3470	0	a	Yeah .
3471	0	a	That is it .
3472	1	a	If you dump it in there .
3473	0	a	What is your username ?
3474	0	a	What is your username and password ?
3475	0	a	Your username .
3476	0	a	Sorry .
3477	0	a	Okay .
3478	0	a	Okay .
3479	1	a	There we go .
3480	0	a	Excellent .
3481	0	a	Right .
3482	0	a	Hopefully that is us ready to to go .
3483	0	a	So .
3484	0	a	Functional design meeting .
3485	1	a	We will have to flesh out some of the stuff .
3486	1	a	we will start with the minutes of the last meeting .
3487	0	a	Not a lot thankfully to say .
3488	0	a	We introduced ourselves , discussed the possibility of a macro facility , interac interacting the TV a bit more , mentioning of bar code , joystick for user manipulation , and ergonomics of the remote control as well .
3489	0	a	it is come to my attention the following .
3490	0	a	Teletext has become outdated due to the populat popularity of the internet .
3491	0	a	Remote control should only be used for the TV .
3492	0	a	due for time to market and possibly also cost issues .
3493	0	a	also key is the corporate image should stay recognisable , f your colour and slogan of course is down at the bottom there .
3494	0	a	Now .
3495	0	a	Just to say quickly I would have thought that only being used for a television the macro facility may now not be required .
3496	0	a	or at l its functionality would have been of limited use .
3497	0	a	So
3498	1	a	to the point in my opinion anyway that it might not be worth pursuing .
3499	1	a	if anybody disagrees we can definitely say so .
3500	1	a	and hopefully we will just crack on and we will get everything going .
3501	1	a	I would like to if possible hear from our Marketing Expert first ,
3502	0	a	to help us gain an idea of where we are going to go .
3503	0	a	Kay .
3504	0	a	So
3505	1	a	I will just load up your presentation from here if you want .
3506	0	a	Sure .
3507	0	a	, sh would you like to
3508	1	a	I will just do it from here .
3509	0	a	Yep .
3510	0	a	Sorry .
3511	0	a	Is yours the
3512	0	a	Oh
3513	0	a	sorry .
3514	0	a	, try second one maybe .
3515	1	a	Try it ,
3516	0	a	yeah maybe .
3517	0	a	Yeah .
3518	0	a	Okay .
3519	0	a	Okay , right .
3520	0	a	Oh , I thought I put in my last name , I guess not ,
3521	0	a	but .
3522	0	a	if you
3523	0	a	that is all right .
3524	0	a	Okay .
3525	0	a	If you
3526	0	a	do you want me to just cycle through it for you or ?
3527	0	a	Yeah ?
3528	0	a	Okay .
3529	0	a	Oh yeah , that would be fine , that would be great .
3530	0	a	Okay .
3531	0	a	Functional requirement by me Ebenezer .
3532	0	a	Okay , so
3533	0	a	we did some research , we asked one hundred people their opinions on remote controls .
3534	0	a	We asked some open ended questions , just , what are your opinions on the remote control , got a lot of re responses , and we asked some very specific questions , and we got a lot of good feedback .
3535	0	a	Please bear in mind this is only a hundred people , so even when the groups are divided into fifteen to twenty five , twenty five to thirty five , there is only maybe ten people fifteen people in each group .
3536	0	a	Okay .
3537	0	a	Okay .
3538	0	a	So
3539	0	a	we got
3540	0	a	some the bad stuff we got , remotes are often lost .
3541	0	a	I often lose my remote control , the back of the couch , some place , and even if it is not lost permanently , it takes me a few minutes to find it .
3542	0	a	Most buttons are not used any more , like you said , teletext is outdated now .
3543	0	a	I remember trying to load a DVD player recently , and there were so many buttons , it took me
3544	0	a	I do not know maybe ten minutes to to go through each button , cause you have to press the shift button to access the yellow buttons ,
3545	0	a	you know
3546	0	a	there is just a lot of stuff that no one really uses .
3547	0	a	And if they do , not very often .
3548	0	a	Takes too long to master the remote control .
3549	0	a	I have seen some remote controls that are big , they have a lot of buttons , you have to hold down more than one key at one time to do something ,
3550	0	a	they are just not great to use .
3551	0	a	We just got a lot of bad complaints about remote controls , people do not like remote controls .
3552	0	a	Some of the good stuff we got .
3553	0	a	Between the age of fifteen and twenty five , most people would be willing to pay extra for voice recognition software .
3554	1	a	Now do not get excited yet ,
3555	1	a	I have got more to say on that .
3556	0	a	Most people would be willing to pay for that most people want remote controls to be pretty , they want it to be fancy , th they
3557	0	a	they want it to be different , everybody has a white remote control with black buttons , and a red button and a green button , not everybody wants that .
3558	1	a	Finally , my opinion .
3559	0	a	Yep .
3560	0	a	The voice recognition thing is cool .
3561	0	a	And voice recognition , the software , open source software exist already .
3562	0	a	It is a bit sketchy at some times , , you are not going to get good always accurate results ,
3563	0	a	but for a very fixed number of words ,
3564	0	a	you know
3565	0	a	you have ,
3566	0	a	how many different words can you have for a remote control ,
3567	0	a	up , down , left , right , channel five , channel seven ,
3568	0	a	you know ,
3569	0	a	how many ,
3570	0	a	you ca not have that many words .
3571	0	a	For a fixed vocabulary it works quite well .
3572	0	a	I am pretty sure people would buy it .
3573	0	a	But after a while people may want to return it ,
3574	0	a	because if you have to to say som
3575	0	a	I mean most people use a remote control for switching to channels , and they say they do that about ninety eight percent of the time .
3576	0	a	Using the remote control , ninety eight percent of the time for changing channels , and that is for flickering through channels .
3577	0	a	So if you have to say up , up , up , up , if you have to do that all the time , then people might get a bit fed up with that and they may return it .
3578	0	a	However , oh , because the voice recognition software exists already , there is no need to spend money on research and development , but this does mean the need for microphones in the in the remote control , which is an unusual feature in my opinion .
3579	1	a	But if we do have the voice recognition thing , there is a lot of stuff that you can get rid of .
3580	0	a	See , you could
3581	0	a	there are two options .
3582	1	a	Either you have voice recognition by itself ,
3583	0	a	which I think is a bit impractical for like night time if you want to be watching television and you want to be quiet , or I do not know you have a visitor coming round and the remote is only trained for you , it is a bit impractical to have just voice recognition by itself .
3584	1	a	So you can have voice recognition and a regular remote .
3585	0	a	But imagine you got rid of the regular remote part , then you can design the remote to look any way you want it to look , because there are no restrictions on physical size , or shape , it it could be as fancy as you want it to be ,
3586	0	a	you know ,
3587	0	a	it could be like a lollipop or something like that , something weird like that .
3588	0	a	As long as the voice recognition stuff works , that is that is fine .
3589	0	a	Okay , yep .
3590	0	a	So
3591	0	a	we have the three birds , we have the design ,
3592	0	a	that
3593	0	a	we have the the fancy bit ,
3594	0	a	right ,
3595	0	a	the voice recognition is fancy , it is cool , it is different , it is radical ,
3596	0	a	so ,
3597	0	a	and then we have an extra bit
3598	0	a	I do not remember
3599	0	a	so
3600	0	a	I am pretty sure people will buy the remote ,
3601	0	a	but is it practical to have a voice recognition system in a remote control ,
3602	0	a	I think is a big question .
3603	0	a	, will people will people be willing to wait for the the period that it will take to train the remote ,
3604	0	a	cause I think it will the remote will get better over time with the same user user ,
3605	0	a	but for the first week or for the first two weeks are you willing to wait , are you willing to have a bad remote control .
3606	0	a	And what if you have visitors come round ,
3607	0	a	they stay the night , they want to use the TV , they ca not use the remote because they speak differently to you .
3608	1	a	, how do you account for regional accents and stuff like that .
3609	0	a	, will people return the remote control ,
3610	0	a	I think a lot of young people will buy the remote control , if they have the money ,
3611	0	a	you know , so ,
3612	0	a	do our audience have the money ,
3613	0	a	but would they return it after a while
3614	0	a	because it is not as fast as pressing a button , it is not a practical .
3615	0	a	So .
3616	0	a	If you could
3617	0	a	sor
3618	1	a	if you could speed it up a bit , yeah .
3619	1	a	These are things I think we should consider .
3620	0	a	I think it is cool ,
3621	0	a	I am sorry ?
3622	0	a	Sure .
3623	1	a	If you could speed it up a bit please , yeah .
3624	0	a	I am about to end , yeah .
3625	0	a	Sorry .
3626	0	a	Cool .
3627	0	a	I think it is cool
3628	1	a	but there are definitely some considerations .
3629	0	a	Okay .
3630	0	a	So ,
3631	0	a	yeah .
3632	0	a	Excellent .
3633	0	a	Right .
3634	1	a	Hear from the User Interface Designer
3635	1	a	now I think might be an idea .
3636	0	a	Okay .
3637	0	a	, you have got your presentation now ,
3638	0	a	is it on the
3639	0	a	is it ?
3640	0	a	Okay .
3641	0	a	How did where did
3642	0	a	where did you get all your in information ?
3643	0	a	Oh .
3644	0	a	Yeah , it is in the it is in the folder
3645	0	a	yeah .
3646	0	a	There was a website , , right here .
3647	0	a	, okay .
3648	0	a	Technical functions ?
3649	0	a	No .
3650	0	a	Yeah .
3651	0	a	Okay .
3652	0	a	Okay ,
3653	0	a	this is a brief run through of the of the technical functions of the remote .
3654	0	a	As is the the
3655	0	a	the presentation is already slightly obsolete
3656	0	a	because I had in mind something that would be i be aimed at controlling multiple devices but there is still stuff of relevance ,
3657	0	a	so
3658	1	a	press on .
3659	0	a	Okay .
3660	0	a	I have looked at looked at a num couple of other remote control models just for an idea of basic design principles .
3661	0	a	and was not really satisfied by what I saw I have to say
3662	0	a	so this is more sort of springboard for how these could be improved on .
3663	0	a	basically the job of the device is to send commands to an appliance , in this case the television set .
3664	0	a	to save you getting off your backside .
3665	0	a	and there is two main trends in th in the sort of design practice .
3666	0	a	On the one hand and this this particularly relates to its sort of earliest models where with you know i so so many buttons on it so about the size of the television set .
3667	0	a	giving you every possible function that the that the device has , the remote control controls .
3668	0	a	And most of these functions are not going to be used ,
3669	0	a	it creates a rather user unfriendly interface .
3670	0	a	And on the other hand there is a user focused approach that pares things down to just what what is most likely to get used .
3671	0	a	With a and a
3672	0	a	and of course there is a certain amount of sort of loss of function here obviously , but mostly that is relatively peripheral functions .
3673	0	a	And so you go for something that is fairly intuitive to use , and well f the for the most part for TV remote
3674	0	a	it is tha that would be channel control and volume .
3675	0	a	and if you if you if you are wanting to incorporate control of a DV DVD or VCR presumably into that then there is a play , pause , stop , rewind , fast forward , record , so forth .
3676	1	a	My own view is that we should definitely be going for a user focused design .
3677	0	a	but the pro I think the problem with a lot of the sort of user focused designs that are about is that they sort of make assumptions in advance
3678	0	a	about what what a given user is going to want mo want to do from want it to do most .
3679	0	a	So ,
3680	1	a	something that is something that is more programmable , that perh perhaps has the full range of functions available to it
3681	1	a	but you can then specify yourself what you are most likely to want .
3682	1	a	so that those are then immediately accessible through fairly minimal number of controls ,
3683	0	a	I liked Ebenezer is idea of including a joystick in that and possibly a sort of fairly minimal number of sort of function buttons ,
3684	0	a	and have a disp
3685	1	a	you then have some sort of basic display on it so that if you are sort of cha changing from different modes for the device it will tell you just exactly what you know each direction of the of the joystick is going to do or wha or what each function button is going to do .
3686	0	a	, this is actually a again slightly taking inspiration off of games controllers ,
3687	0	a	you know
3688	0	a	the Playstation control where you have four basic function buttons that are just marked with distinctive geometrical shapes
3689	0	a	but the
3690	0	a	and then dependent on what you are doing with it what game
3691	0	a	and so on those those functions are then sort of further specified .
3692	0	a	And so it is taking taking the lead from that .
3693	0	a	Okay .
3694	0	a	Yeah .
3695	0	a	Right .
3696	0	a	That is it .
3697	1	a	if we could hear from our Industrial engineer , or Designer .
3698	0	a	Yeah .
3699	0	a	, I was still working on stuff , I had not got it finished .
3700	0	a	, alright .
3701	0	a	Click to save in
3702	0	a	where do I have to save it ? ,
3703	0	a	what I have done with it ,
3704	0	a	I am sorry .
3705	0	a	If you look on the desktop you will find that there is a link to the project folder , or project documents .
3706	0	a	If you save it in there we can open it up from here .
3707	0	a	Shit .
3708	1	a	I am just closing it now .
3709	0	a	Are you finding it
3710	0	a	okay
3711	0	a	or ?
3712	0	a	Okay .
3713	0	a	where I have saved it .
3714	0	a	Well like
3715	1	a	if you go to one , whichever one you were working
3716	0	a	yeah ,
3717	1	a	and you just click file save as .
3718	0	a	that is it there ,
3719	0	a	yeah .
3720	0	a	Oh right .
3721	0	a	, right
3722	0	a	I am responsible for working design , , this is basically the inside going on of the the remote control .
3723	0	a	So we have the energy source , we have the user interface , this this is what I have seen .
3724	0	a	the sender will push the button , the chip will respond , and then the dig digital signal is sent to the TV .
3725	0	a	So ,
3726	1	a	if you go to next slide ,
3727	0	a	you will see you will see what do we need on the user interface .
3728	0	a	Do we need many buttons , or do we need l many light bulbs
3729	0	a	that could be easier to to realise which appliances are on or not .
3730	0	a	, , or would that take too much power , would we need more components in there to supply the power ?
3731	0	a	, the joystick is another thing , if we were going to add that , , there would be more components to deal with that .
3732	0	a	, so
3733	0	a	we need to
3734	0	a	I dunno exactly what That is the design of the the the layout of the electronic design , obviously there will be more details once we have decided what we are putting on the user interface .
3735	0	a	Okay .
3736	0	a	So ,
3737	1	a	that will be decided , I guess .
3738	1	a	, and the next slide .
3739	0	a	Oh , yeah ,
3740	1	a	if you go to the next slide then .
3741	0	a	Oh .
3742	0	a	Yeah .
3743	0	a	I just used the
3744	0	a	it was a mess ,
3745	0	a	I was just putting adding it together at the end there .
3746	0	a	do not worry about it at all mate .
3747	0	a	so
3748	0	a	you have the energy source obviously connected to the chip , and the user interface obviously contains everything .
3749	0	a	You have the switch turn it on , infrared bulb , will contact the TV and will have whatever device or DVD player , the bulb will turn on to say it is on .
3750	0	a	, so
3751	0	a	do we need on the control different buttons to decide , or different light bulbs , would it be easier ?
3752	0	a	, I dunno what we should decide on that .
3753	0	a	Okay .
3754	0	a	Well .
3755	0	a	Oh sorry ,
3756	0	a	I am I am interrupting you .
3757	0	a	Are you is it
3758	0	a	yeah ?
3759	0	a	Okay .
3760	0	a	No , it is finished , yeah .
3761	0	a	Right .
3762	0	a	, right
3763	1	a	we can probably skip that for now .
3764	0	a	So ,
3765	0	a	we have had some stuff put forward , along with the new user requirements , we have had a lot of kind of input I would say so far .
3766	0	a	I hear what the Marketing Expert is saying about voice activated control .
3767	0	a	However I have got a couple of worries about that .
3768	0	a	The power required , and the ability to the cost , it seems like for an embedded system , this could cause us issues .
3769	0	a	Cost .
3770	0	a	for example you see that there is fairly robust services on computers via via voice , IBM do drag and dictate , but these require a lot of memory and usually state quite advanced processor requirements .
3771	0	a	voice activation could be an interesting idea
3772	0	a	but I think that our Ind Industrial Designer would probably upon some research say that it is maybe not feasible .
3773	0	a	Kay .
3774	0	a	that is just my view right now , however the idea of a joystick and then maybe an LCD which has been kind of put forward so far ,
3775	0	a	it is almost like having a small T not TV to say ,
3776	0	a	but if you can control almost all of the functionality from the display , I do not know how much power an LCD would take ,
3777	0	a	but it might be quite low ?
3778	0	a	Well
3779	1	a	literally if you can imagine the display maybe slightly larger than those on a a mobile phone , something where you can read an an fair amount of information , traverse maybe quite a few menus ,
3780	0	a	if we maybe used mobile phones as a good example ,
3781	0	a	they usually incorporate they have the keypad , and then evr all the other functionality is usually associated inside by traversing around .
3782	1	a	LCD on the remote just telling you what is on , or , interactive LCD or
3783	0	a	Do you think that people will get mixed up ,
3784	0	a	like ,
3785	0	a	they will be looking at this screen and that screen and
3786	0	a	then , you know , trying to get everything working ,
3787	0	a	would it be a bit confusing ?
3788	0	a	Yeah .
3789	0	a	I
3790	1	a	That could be one possibility .
3791	1	a	and then we could have like say the common buttons as you say , volume control , changing channels
3792	0	a	We
3793	0	a	I would agree with you .
3794	1	a	I I was thinking that the remote the sort of default functions for the joystick would be up and down for volume , left and right for channels .
3795	0	a	I think probably for the first couple of hours of using it but you know muscle memory is a wonderful thing , .
3796	0	a	And I think
3797	0	a	and I think that size of display was about what I had in mind .
3798	0	a	though I mean I w I would say that we could probably probably be required to mo
3799	0	a	most of the mobile phone displays you see these days are colour
3800	1	a	but we should probably try to stick to black and white .
3801	0	a	Si si simply to keep m keep the unit cost down .
3802	1	a	I mean colour could be a sort of subsequent development
3803	0	a	but you know cost a bit of extra money
3804	0	a	f w w w w w
3805	1	a	once everyone is got the first , you know , oh colour is out , we will have to replace it
3806	0	a	wo not we .
3807	0	a	It does nothing extra .
3808	0	a	That would be my feeling as well
3809	0	a	, I think we could possibly create quite a useful user interface .
3810	0	a	now I mean
3811	0	a	I do not
3812	0	a	sorry ,
3813	1	a	go for it .
3814	0	a	Sure
3815	0	a	but the idea of a remote with a menu or and a joystick I think like I h if I was in the habit of buying remote controls then I would want one ,
3816	0	a	but I think we do not have a specific audience ,
3817	0	a	you know ,
3818	1	a	like what is our target audience , what niche are niche are we trying to market and corner .
3819	0	a	You know ,
3820	0	a	you know what I am saying ,
3821	0	a	like ,
3822	1	a	for whom is this intended ?
3823	0	a	Everybody ?
3824	0	a	Most people , yeah .
3825	1	a	I think it could probably be aimed at most people who have used a mobile .
3826	1	a	And that might be just another way of saying try to target most people .
3827	0	a	, if we are if we were to follow that avenue , we might be s
3828	0	a	you know we are kind of almost relying on their experience with a mobile phone I suppose .
3829	0	a	But that does cover a very large section of the people out there .
3830	0	a	Sure .
3831	0	a	I think that is fair
3832	0	a	yeah .
3833	0	a	, I mean
3834	1	a	I imagine as well that the actual LCD and maybe to a certain extent the joystick as well would be for the additional functionality .
3835	0	a	Which maybe does not get used as often ,
3836	0	a	maybe it makes it easy for them to figure out how to change the channels as in the frequencies and such for reprogramming it .
3837	1	a	and you can still have the main buttons that allow the people to turn the machine on and off , d up and down ,
3838	0	a	it depends ,
3839	0	a	I mean
3840	1	a	maybe we have the fol the joystick as a separate one for the other functions then , that there is just a a small number of as you were saying buttons that have already been defined .
3841	0	a	So like
3842	1	a	we go for the nice standard up and down for and volume control .
3843	0	a	So that literally anybody can come along , pick up the remote and still know what do do .
3844	1	a	And they can completely ignore most of the functionality which would be for say the o actual owner of the the TV
3845	0	a	and who would normally use the unit .
3846	0	a	I dunno .
3847	0	a	I th the thing I like about the the joystick
3848	0	a	is that you
3849	0	a	you
3850	0	a	you then basically you can then basically put it
3851	0	a	I mean for for T T for TV remote alone
3852	0	a	, you could put
3853	0	a	I mean there are like I say the the
3854	0	a	the main things people do with a TV remote control is the volume and the channel .
3855	0	a	You can pack all that onto was onto a single control .
3856	0	a	But but the but then o obviously if
3857	0	a	you know
3858	1	a	if you i if you wanted to access further functions i you
3859	1	a	you then get to sort of menu navigation .
3860	0	a	I mean with things like ch with things like tuning and channels you know adjusting brightn brightness and fiddly things that no one really bothers with , most TVs these days actually have menus anyway
3861	0	a	so this would be a fairly rational way of integra integrating the the remote with the device it is controlling .
3862	0	a	concern about our market .
3863	0	a	, if we are
3864	0	a	I mean most of the of the replacement remote market is sort of remote control rationalisation .
3865	0	a	, you have got twenty different devices in your living room , you want one wo y
3866	0	a	you want one that will do the job of all of them .
3867	0	a	Yeah .
3868	0	a	, if all you are replacing is one of the you know however many remotes you have in your living room , you know you still need separate remotes for everything else .
3869	0	a	I just think that possibly
3870	0	a	Well
3871	0	a	this is a requirement that we have to stick to I am afraid , this is not one that I have just arbitrarily decided on .
3872	0	a	So
3873	0	a	this is this is one of the solid ones that has to be obeyed , for now .
3874	0	a	So
3875	0	a	I can understand your point ,
3876	0	a	and I would agree with you ,
3877	0	a	but this is our design spec for now .
3878	0	a	Afraid to say .
3879	0	a	I would say so , yes , because then we have to be able to control the remote boxes , and that is a separate unit .
3880	0	a	Does that
3881	0	a	would that include access to say interactive functions on digital or cable ?
3882	0	a	Yeah .
3883	0	a	I think that it
3884	0	a	I would say that the design spec we have been with is for the television only for now .
3885	1	a	And until we hear otherwise we should go with just that .
3886	0	a	Okay , specifically television .
3887	0	a	Okay .
3888	0	a	Okay .
3889	0	a	Maybe we will hear differently ,
3890	0	a	but for now
3891	0	a	It would be ease of manipulation of certain functions , yes .
3892	0	a	So the joystick is just for differentness .
3893	0	a	Okay .
3894	1	a	Just a thought .
3895	0	a	There is that possibility , yes .
3896	1	a	maybe then our market should be TV manufacturers , rather than the public .
3897	1	a	Try and sell it t sell it to them to supply with
3898	0	a	, yeah , I have seen them .
3899	0	a	B
3900	0	a	However I do not know exactly where we will be going with that ,
3901	0	a	but it might not even be the avenue of the Marketing Expert , that might be sales , who are not in this meeting .
3902	0	a	It is just , the way I figure it , twelve point five Euros per unit , we have to sell at least like three million or something like that , not to account for all the the money we waste on remotes that no one buys ,
3903	0	a	you know , like
3904	0	a	if we made a perf if we made a ks for every remote we made someone bought it , then we have to sell a lot of remote controls .
3905	0	a	We just
3906	0	a	Is this going to be enough to to sell ?
3907	0	a	Yeah .
3908	0	a	Well ,
3909	0	a	something else that you brought up was the ability to lose a remote , which as you said you have done , in fact we have probably all done .
3910	0	a	, I do not know if it is a gimmick or not ,
3911	0	a	but have any of you ever seen those odd little key rings
3912	0	a	where if you whistle , it will beep and you tell you where it is .
3913	0	a	I had one of those , and my brother , and my dad , could have beat me up because it it went off all the time accidentally .
3914	0	a	Well
3915	1	a	the other option of course is that the
3916	0	a	well
3917	0	a	I was going to say clapping ,
3918	0	a	digital telephones , for example , one unit has
3919	0	a	of course you have to have that base unit , somewhere where there is a button ,
3920	1	a	but maybe it is a button that you attach to the TV .
3921	1	a	The clapping one .
3922	1	a	To a television .
3923	1	a	Something which you when you press that , it would beep to give its location away , on the remote unit .
3924	0	a	Yeah .
3925	0	a	And that could be something could separate us a bit .
3926	0	a	Yeah , I think that is a good idea .
3927	0	a	Yeah , that is a good idea .
3928	0	a	And that way , because we are attaching what would be a small button to the TV ,
3929	1	a	again say what , it would be a small transmitter , watch battery type scenario I would say , or something that if it was problems enough you could actually even just I do not power that might be something that we could look into .
3930	0	a	Yeah
3931	0	a	We are just saying volume .
3932	0	a	Yep .
3933	0	a	Yeah ,
3934	0	a	it is putting a lot on your shoulders there ,
3935	0	a	so I mean
3936	0	a	that could be something that separates us a bit from the market as well .
3937	0	a	I think so , yeah .
3938	0	a	So .
3939	1	a	To go on from here .
3940	1	a	we have to decide exactly what we are going to do with the remote .
3941	1	a	Before we leave this meeting , it would be best to say this is what we are going this is the design we are going to try and get , this is how we are going to make ourselves look unique .
3942	0	a	Do we go for maybe a remote contro
3943	0	a	sorry ,
3944	0	a	we are going to go for a remote control obviously ,
3945	0	a	do we go for a small joystick that would operate say changing channels , up and down , and then , what , another button that would say that it is now being used to manoeuvre round the LCD .
3946	0	a	yeah .
3947	0	a	Yeah ,
3948	0	a	I think that is
3949	0	a	Yeah .
3950	1	a	Should volume be important in the joystick , do you think ?
3951	0	a	Yep .
3952	1	a	We could use say the left and right for changing channels and the up and down for volume ,
3953	0	a	and
3954	0	a	Okay .
3955	1	a	For volume .
3956	0	a	But we have a frequency of how what people use a remote control for most .
3957	0	a	, power is used like once per hour , channel selection is used a hundred and sixty eight per hour , that is by far the biggest one , and then teletext , is still here , that is like fourteen , and volume selection .
3958	0	a	I
3959	0	a	Yeah , think so .
3960	0	a	Vol Volume selection
3961	0	a	okay
3962	0	a	, yep ,
3963	0	a	the teletext we are gambling with ,
3964	1	a	and we are going to say it is dead , the way of the dodo
3965	0	a	So we
3966	0	a	well ,
3967	0	a	sorry ,
3968	1	a	we could maybe even go as far as saying power button , small joystick , LCD ,
3969	1	a	and then what
3970	1	a	maybe is it one more button to say that you are using the menu system , and with the possibility of pushing down on the joystick to say okay ?
3971	0	a	So we are having very very few buttons involved , but navigation around a menu for most things .
3972	0	a	No ,
3973	0	a	yeah ,
3974	0	a	okay okay .
3975	0	a	Yeah ,
3976	0	a	Actually how
3977	0	a	Actually I would say maybe two two function buttons , the y we are now using the menus button and and an og and an okay button .
3978	0	a	I mean certainly something I have found with the joystick on mo
3979	0	a	the joysticks on mobile phones is that a lot of the time th the device mistakes you trying to move it in one direction or the other for pushing down for okay .
3980	0	a	Okay .
3981	0	a	Okay .
3982	0	a	Or vice versa .
3983	0	a	And that is really irritating .
3984	0	a	Okay .
3985	0	a	The o the o the other dis design constraint
3986	0	a	I think we should bear in mind is that people are you know very much used to using a remote control one handedly ,
3987	1	a	, so we need to make sure that e even with the joystick , you know something that can just sit comfortably in the palm of the hand and have the joystick just controlled by the thumb .
3988	0	a	So
3989	0	a	we are actually that sounds like a rough idea .
3990	0	a	Do we incorporate the idea of trying to f locate the remote control again via a beeping noise ?
3991	0	a	Do you mind looking ?
3992	0	a	The ability to locate it again .
3993	0	a	, I think because it is so small
3994	0	a	it might be an
3995	0	a	I mean if we only have like two three buttons it might be essential to have to have that
3996	0	a	Yeah .
3997	0	a	So that would require a transmitter maybe attached to the TV , just so that it says find me , and what , a basically a small microphone on the actual unit ,
3998	1	a	can maybe hide it in the base .
3999	1	a	Light bulb as well ,
4000	0	a	no ?
4001	1	a	And a light bulb ?
4002	0	a	No .
4003	0	a	Oh .
4004	0	a	Sorry ?
4005	0	a	Some speaker ,
4006	0	a	sorry ,
4007	0	a	yeah .
4008	0	a	So so
4009	0	a	a small speaker you mean .
4010	0	a	Speaker
4011	0	a	yeah .
4012	1	a	To flash .
4013	0	a	No .
4014	0	a	E us
4015	0	a	we might be better with the sound possibly
4016	0	a	we could maybe incorporate
4017	0	a	th e the true fact , considering the cost of an LED , we could just incorporate it anyway .
4018	0	a	Nah ,
4019	0	a	you would see it anyway , if you hear it .
4020	0	a	W
4021	0	a	those little key rings have both ,
4022	0	a	so
4023	0	a	Yeah .
4024	0	a	Yeah .
4025	0	a	Yeah .
4026	0	a	The LEDs can be surprisingly bright now .
4027	0	a	Yeah .
4028	0	a	Blue ones particularly .
4029	0	a	Plus that is a nice wee design touch .
4030	0	a	Yeah .
4031	0	a	So
4032	0	a	by the sounds of it , with what we are suggesting so far , your design the user interface is still quite open ,
4033	1	a	you could go for quite an interesting design .
4034	0	a	Because we are only going to have a very few key and you have got you know a small LCD , joystick ,
4035	0	a	e
4036	0	a	I think it leaves you open to a a potential wide range of shapes , something that can make it stand out slightly .
4037	1	a	if you could look into what we have suggested so far , the feasibility of small transmitter , and such , maybe if an LCD screen requires too much power , or such .
4038	1	a	Ebenezer , , Marketing Expert
4039	0	a	If ,
4040	0	a	yeah
4041	1	a	if you could maybe as well see what people think about the idea of this minimalist approach that we have taken , where of a joystick to control the very basic functions , and then the idea of manipulating it like you would a mobile .
4042	0	a	Well
4043	0	a	I can give you the frequency , what people what options people use most often ,
4044	0	a	I guess that is going to be important in the ts defining the the software side of the interface ,
4045	0	a	right .
4046	0	a	You want the stuff .
4047	0	a	Okay .
4048	0	a	Okay .
4049	0	a	I do not know how easy that will be within the time frame ,
4050	1	a	but could be something we could maybe look into .
4051	0	a	Sure .
4052	0	a	Sure .
4053	0	a	Okay .
4054	0	a	any last comments that anybody would like to put forward ?
4055	0	a	Anything that they think has been missed out .
4056	0	a	Bit of a wide open question there of course .
4057	1	a	Feel free to email me if you think that we have screwed something up and want to get it rectified as soon as possible .
4058	0	a	Sure .
4059	0	a	Kay .
4060	0	a	Right .
4061	0	a	Yeah .
4062	0	a	So
4063	0	a	I should just look at the speaker , the speaker and an LED .
4064	0	a	And
4065	0	a	Yeah ,
4066	1	a	and a transmitter .
4067	0	a	Speaker and LED for locating , , transmitter
4068	0	a	getting the external power source ,
4069	0	a	yep , that is quite true .
4070	1	a	Actually one one wee thought about that .
4071	1	a	, if we do end up trying to market this to television manufacturers then the then the transmitter could actually be built into the television .
4072	0	a	, and something that we can can easily be adopted at the last minute as well I would say .
4073	0	a	Yeah .
4074	1	a	The electronics could be s either placed externally or internally ,
4075	0	a	makes no difference to the final product of the actual remote control ,
4076	0	a	so that is good .
4077	0	a	Kay .
4078	0	a	You know I think
4079	0	a	I mean if it w if we get a major television manufacturer to say y
4080	0	a	oh yeah we will have that
4081	0	a	, save us the bother , then that is you know vast amounts of sales .
4082	0	a	P
4083	0	a	Fashion .
4084	0	a	Quite quickly .
4085	0	a	Oh ,
4086	0	a	one thing that we have almost not talked about at all ,
4087	0	a	my apologies for that ,
4088	0	a	, user interface , we also need to maybe get the slogan in here ,
4089	0	a	it is ,
4090	0	a	I am pointing at my laptop ,
4091	0	a	what in God
4092	0	a	Real reaction , and such .
4093	0	a	So
4094	0	a	Oh , sorry .
4095	0	a	The slogan is
4096	0	a	yeah ,
4097	0	a	the slogan is we put the fashion in electronics ,
4098	0	a	is not it ?
4099	0	a	My apologies .
4100	0	a	No
4101	0	a	it could well be ,
4102	0	a	I have probably missed that .
4103	0	a	, I think that is l almost the last minute thing
4104	1	a	we can just incorporate into the actual plastic on top .
4105	0	a	So I am not too concerned a that we have not gone into depth about that .
4106	1	a	But it might be something you could consider when you are thinking about shapes ?
4107	1	a	In fact we might like to put a slogan on , and possibly the two Rs to signify the company .
4108	1	a	Rather than real reaction .
4109	0	a	Yeah .
4110	1	a	I thought the the d the double arc could perhaps be the the enter button .
4111	0	a	Sounds good .
4112	1	a	And I would say that that is us for now .
4113	0	a	 
4114	0	a	Alright , yeah .
4115	1	a	crack on .
4116	0	a	Okay so
4117	0	a	we will start off with a quick overview of the minutes .
4118	1	a	I think to sum up the last meeting , would be to say the requirements that we have set out .
4119	0	a	Those are we were going to go for what seemed to be a fairly minimal design based on a small joystick , LCD and a couple of other buttons for navigation with power being I suppose one of the main single purpose buttons .
4120	0	a	we were also going to use novelty of being able to locate the remote control again via a small transmitter with any luck , the idea to try and separate us and also because of the minimal design looks like we will be able to be fairly adventurous in the actual physical shape of our remote control with any luck .
4121	0	a	that pretty much sums up the last one .
4122	0	a	So
4123	1	a	we will just crack on , like to maybe start with the Industrial Designer if it is possible .
4124	0	a	okay .
4125	0	a	the con today is the concep today .
4126	0	a	I will just
4127	0	a	I have a presentation I just saved it in the the folder .
4128	0	a	This meeting is the conceptual design phase
4129	0	a	and is
4130	0	a	Sorry about this .
4131	1	a	And is to cover things like what the parts might be made of , , can we outsource these from elsewhere , will we have to construct any items ourselves ?
4132	0	a	Yeah , okay
4133	0	a	well
4134	1	a	I will just I will load it up then .
4135	0	a	Which one do y
4136	0	a	Oh ,
4137	0	a	interface concept ?
4138	0	a	That is you .
4139	0	a	Yeah , that is me .
4140	0	a	We have got trend watching , that is you .
4141	0	a	It is
4142	0	a	Components design .
4143	0	a	Components design .
4144	0	a	Okay .
4145	0	a	Alright .
4146	0	a	So .
4147	0	a	The case le that is what I wrote first of all , could be plastic our plastic .
4148	0	a	but later on we found out that it can be rubber as well , or titanium or even wood .
4149	0	a	So
4150	1	a	we decide what it is going to be .
4151	1	a	Probably plastic .
4152	0	a	we need the infra red transmitter .
4153	1	a	Get that off the shelf .
4154	0	a	joystick we will probably if we are going to use it , could be plastic w or rubber even as well .
4155	1	a	if you go on to the next slide .
4156	1	a	If you go on to f findings ,
4157	0	a	it is like two or three slides down .
4158	0	a	Right .
4159	0	a	Okay .
4160	0	a	So ,
4161	0	a	this is what I found we can use .
4162	0	a	three different types of batteries .
4163	0	a	can either use a hand dynamo , or the kinetic type ones , you know that they use in watches , or else a solar powered one .
4164	0	a	Okay .
4165	0	a	Now ,
4166	0	a	the kinetic one , we have cause that is the ones where like you the movement causes it .
4167	0	a	Cost is
4168	0	a	Yeah .
4169	0	a	Yeah .
4170	0	a	the bat the battery for a a watch would not require a lot of power , would be my one query .
4171	0	a	Is a kinetic one going to be able to supply enough power ?
4172	0	a	Do you think ?
4173	0	a	W
4174	0	a	Which I suppose as well would allow us to go off the shelf again , you would say ?
4175	0	a	There is also a watch moves around a great deal more .
4176	0	a	Yeah ,
4177	0	a	I do not think it would .
4178	0	a	Yeah .
4179	0	a	And solar cells , I dunno about that .
4180	0	a	yeah .
4181	1	a	We should probably just use conventional batteries .
4182	1	a	, just like in usual remote controls .
4183	0	a	Yeah .
4184	0	a	And these are three different types of or two different types three different types of shapes you can have .
4185	0	a	one is a flat one , and then more original ones are single curved one or one with a double curved .
4186	0	a	the materials are tha there as you can see , but you ca not have a titanium one for a double curved ,
4187	0	a	which would be
4188	0	a	Yeah , and light .
4189	0	a	Titanium , the really strong metal , titanium ?
4190	0	a	Is it not also it is expensive ?
4191	0	a	Two curves .
4192	0	a	, i think so as well ,
4193	0	a	yeah .
4194	0	a	They make mountain bikes out of that ,
4195	0	a	do not they .
4196	0	a	So it is really light as well .
4197	0	a	Curious .
4198	0	a	, I do not know if you would be able to off the top of your head or not ,
4199	0	a	the single curved and double curved , would you be able to give an example ?
4200	0	a	could you maybe draw something ?
4201	0	a	I you do not
4202	1	a	does not have to be perfect ,
4203	0	a	it is just cause I am not quite sure if I understand the difference between the two .
4204	0	a	T yeah .
4205	0	a	Well
4206	1	a	for a curved , well I was thinking to f for to sit in your the palm of your hand .
4207	1	a	maybe like this , with the joy pad here .
4208	1	a	Joystick here .
4209	1	a	And maybe an okay button around here ,
4210	0	a	so that the thumb can use it quite easily .
4211	0	a	I do not exactly
4212	0	a	Double curved .
4213	0	a	It probably means this is probably double curved .
4214	0	a	whereas a single curved would be like that .
4215	0	a	I guess .
4216	0	a	Or not necessarily .
4217	0	a	So it might literally just be
4218	0	a	okay .
4219	0	a	Yeah
4220	0	a	like that .
4221	0	a	Whereas this is two curves .
4222	0	a	so I guess that is what they mean by double curve .
4223	0	a	Alright .
4224	0	a	which obviously
4225	0	a	it looks better than the single curve ,
4226	0	a	but you ca not have it in titanium ,
4227	0	a	which is a nice material .
4228	0	a	and for the buttons , it can have the scroll wheel which they use in mouses for com PCs .
4229	0	a	but it requires a more expensive chip to use , and if you want to use LCD it is even more expensive .
4230	0	a	So
4231	1	a	you have to decide ,
4232	0	a	there is trade offs there .
4233	0	a	if you want the buttons to be
4234	0	a	oh yeah ,
4235	0	a	if you have a double curve control and it is rubber , then you have these rubber buttons as well .
4236	0	a	But you are going to ha
4237	1	a	I reckon you are going to have to have key a number keypad anyway for the amount of channels these days .
4238	0	a	You would not want to just have to scroll through all the channels to get to the one you want .
4239	0	a	You want to enter just the number of it , if you know it .
4240	0	a	So
4241	1	a	I reckon we are going to have to have a number keypad anyway .
4242	0	a	Do you think ?
4243	0	a	Yeah .
4244	0	a	Okay ,
4245	1	a	that was definitely something we can talk about .
4246	0	a	so
4247	0	a	you have got a little bit about the the chip that we might require as well ? , do you have any idea so far ,
4248	0	a	like when we are saying that we would need an advanced chip for an LCD ,
4249	0	a	does that in shoot the cost up by a drastic amount ?
4250	0	a	Or ?
4251	0	a	Well
4252	0	a	I think compared to say just pressing buttons .
4253	0	a	So ,
4254	0	a	depends where
4255	0	a	going to spend the money if you want the f fancy LCD display .
4256	0	a	Need an advanced chip for the LCD .
4257	0	a	Is that did I
4258	0	a	Advanced , like three eight six advance .
4259	0	a	Yep .
4260	0	a	if you press a button that sends a certain transmission through the infra red , whereas I think if we are controlling the LCD we definitely require a much more powerful chip .
4261	0	a	Okay .
4262	0	a	Just compared to the chip you would use for pushing buttons I think is the the point being made .
4263	0	a	Okay , sure .
4264	0	a	If I have not over stepped .
4265	0	a	Yeah ?
4266	0	a	Okay ,
4267	0	a	should I go on , or go back ?
4268	0	a	Well
4269	0	a	we would also be relying on the the bulk buying in producement and such .
4270	0	a	Yeah
4271	0	a	i
4272	0	a	the previous slides just explain what is in the internal components of the remote control .
4273	0	a	, if we only have twelve Pounds fifty ,
4274	0	a	twelve Euros , not even twelve Pounds .
4275	0	a	Twelve Euros , what is that , like eight pounds or something like that , nine Pounds ?
4276	0	a	Okay ,
4277	0	a	that is good point .
4278	0	a	I assume .
4279	1	a	We have to look into the costs of those .
4280	0	a	So ,
4281	0	a	sorry .
4282	1	a	If you go to the one before that
4283	0	a	so
4284	0	a	it just says what it does , translate the key press into an infra red signal and this is received by the TV .
4285	0	a	the chip just needs to detect the signal or detect the key press and then it will send it to the tr the amplifier .
4286	0	a	Okay .
4287	0	a	And then the next slide just shows how the copper wires interact with the buttons , the rubber buttons , to get sent to the chip .
4288	0	a	So
4289	0	a	that is just how the control works inside .
4290	1	a	we have to decide on what buttons we are going to use .
4291	0	a	Okay .
4292	0	a	So
4293	0	a	in the information that you have been supplied , how feasible would you say that the idea of using an LCD looks ?
4294	0	a	I mean that sounds like quite a good requirement to me .
4295	0	a	I think we can do it if we use conventional batteries and not have solar cells or kinetic .
4296	1	a	and then maybe use single curved case .
4297	0	a	Because we might need it to be curved for the thumb to use the joyst joystick easily .
4298	0	a	and then you will need the advanced chip obviously for the LCD .
4299	0	a	conventional battery would seem to make sense .
4300	0	a	I am not sure if there is any cost differences between single and double curved
4301	0	a	and I am
4302	0	a	I do not know about anybody else ,
4303	1	a	but plastic or rubber as a traditional form of casing would seem to be a good way forward ? .
4304	0	a	I am actually going to be bold and go oo go straight for rubber for reasons I will go into in more detail .
4305	0	a	Okay .
4306	0	a	I also have a preference for rubber .
4307	0	a	Okay ,
4308	0	a	well Yeah , well
4309	1	a	will we move on to user interface ,
4310	0	a	and
4311	0	a	yeah ?
4312	0	a	sorry ,
4313	0	a	as long as were you ?
4314	0	a	Yeah .
4315	0	a	Based on my research .
4316	0	a	Yep I am finished .
4317	0	a	Okay .
4318	0	a	and d d d interface concept .
4319	0	a	Yep .
4320	1	a	Now I am going to have to work between the the slides and the and the white board
4321	0	a	cause I actually I have some fairly concrete things this time .
4322	0	a	Yeah .
4323	0	a	I was given a an HTML file giving various ideas from from other previous remote control designs ,
4324	0	a	and pretty much decided to just dump them all .
4325	0	a	I was not very impressed by them
4326	0	a	and they did not seem to re
4327	0	a	nothing I saw seemed to meet the sorts of design specifications that we are going for today .
4328	0	a	so
4329	0	a	what I ra
4330	1	a	rather than looking at other remotes , ra oomp be better to simply look at the human hand .
4331	1	a	and try and f and try and figure out a way of laying out the elements we have already decided on ,
4332	0	a	so that if r a if so that the finger is e each finger or thumb is wherever it needs to be already .
4333	0	a	so
4334	1	a	next slide , if you please .
4335	0	a	and what we have basically decided on was the the the joy the joystick , two function buttons and the LCD , just keep it paired down to the absolute minimum .
4336	1	a	I do not actually think we need the the numeric keypad
4337	0	a	because if you m
4338	1	a	because one of the menus that we could have available v via via the LCD is one where you scroll through channels ,
4339	0	a	so if there is something f
4340	0	a	and be bear in mind since this is not meant to work for f f f for di for digital or or for or for cable , whatever , you are basically looking at four or five terrestrial channels , and then your VC and then the channel through your VCR and or DVD player .
4341	0	a	digital .
4342	0	a	, okay .
4343	0	a	And or box .
4344	0	a	So it is not
4345	0	a	I am not really excessively concerned about that .
4346	1	a	You must have two two modes , basic mode , where the joystick is left right left right for channels , up down for volume , and the and the menu mode for further functions .
4347	1	a	now the reason I was particularly interested in using rubber for this is that if we are going to have a highly ergonomic design , it needs to be ergonomic for left or right handed people .
4348	0	a	, so you
4349	0	a	Can I just jump in slightly there ?
4350	0	a	That would suggest the double curved design is probably going to be most appropriate , then .
4351	0	a	Yes , absolutely .
4352	0	a	okay .
4353	1	a	, basi basically what I basically what the what be having , I would say , the the whole thing articulated at two points , so that if you if you are handing it from a lef left or right handed user you can adjust it
4354	0	a	so that the the LC the LCD and the The joystick would be in the right place .
4355	1	a	And also this is a rather nicer de design gimmick that the the you know the whole thing you know it should have sort of organic feel to it that it should be , you know , soft to touch and can be moved around all nice .
4356	0	a	okay
4357	1	a	on to on to the next to the next slide .
4358	0	a	Okay .
4359	0	a	, yeah .
4360	0	a	Just to let you know we will probably be quite tight for time as well , because I think you have probably got a lot you would like to say , I guess .
4361	0	a	Okay .
4362	0	a	Yeah ,
4363	0	a	kay basically
4364	1	a	I can add pretty pictures to this .
4365	0	a	The
4366	0	a	Assuming the hand the hand to be in about sort of this position , hol holding the remote ,
4367	1	a	the the joystick unit should rest over the the joint of the f of the four finger
4368	0	a	so that it is directly accessible for the thumb .
4369	1	a	and it would need t there would need to be a it would need to be articulated just below that
4370	0	a	so that it could be switched around for left or right handed users .
4371	0	a	So .
4372	1	a	You then have a grip section that can be more or less the same irrespective of handedness .
4373	1	a	You just have big two big buttons that cover most of the area so it can in the upper part , one for the four finger , one for the middle finger .
4374	0	a	, and that
4375	0	a	Th this part here is the joystick .
4376	0	a	Is this the joystick ?
4377	0	a	Okay .
4378	0	a	This would be the actual grip .
4379	1	a	Probably where you would want to have the battery as well .
4380	0	a	That would be probably the bulkiest part .
4381	1	a	And you then have , at the at the bottom , the LCD , and this would need to be articulated as well .
4382	1	a	And basically I would want this to rest here , right at the base of the wrist .
4383	0	a	So it would fit just nicely in the hand .
4384	1	a	And again , this part could be rotated ,
4385	0	a	so it can
4386	0	a	So so so that it can be adjusted to either left or right handed user .
4387	0	a	So
4388	1	a	the t the top function button in basic mode would be the on off switch and menu mode would be the enter button .
4389	1	a	And then the bottom function buttons switches between between modes .
4390	0	a	now
4391	0	a	programming it
4392	0	a	actually thi this is one thing I have found with the replacement remote control .
4393	0	a	Programming them can be a right pain .
4394	1	a	So I thought th the simplest way around that would be to have a cable to connect it to the computer some some fair iv fairly fairly simple software on the computer just so that you on your computer
4395	0	a	just so that you could pr program it at a rather in a rather more comfortable interface .
4396	1	a	And you could download programs for it from for TVs from all sort of main manufacturers .
4397	1	a	though you i it would be necessary to have have
4398	1	a	a m have a ha have a mode for programming it without the computer ,
4399	0	a	just in case there are there are still people left out there who do not have them yet .
4400	0	a	But .
4401	0	a	Yeah .
4402	0	a	Okay .
4403	0	a	That is that is my idea .
4404	0	a	Excellent ,
4405	0	a	right .
4406	0	a	Kay .
4407	0	a	File open .
4408	0	a	We go .
4409	0	a	Trend watching .
4410	0	a	Okay .
4411	0	a	So
4412	0	a	to gather my research , two basic methods .
4413	0	a	We compared whether people want the remote control to do a lot of stuff or they want it to look cool .
4414	0	a	And then we we research fashion trends in Europe , what is what is the new black ,
4415	0	a	you know ,
4416	0	a	as it goes .
4417	1	a	Next slide please .
4418	0	a	Okay .
4419	0	a	we found , in order of importance , people want the remote control to look cool more than they want it to to be cool .
4420	0	a	As in they want it to do a lot of good s
4421	0	a	they want it to look like it does a lot , and if it does do a lot that is a bonus , but they do not care so much ,
4422	0	a	you know .
4423	0	a	They want it to be
4424	0	a	that is sounds a bit like a contradiction .
4425	0	a	Technology technical technologically innovative .
4426	0	a	People want it to be that , but s still they care more about the way it looks than what it does .
4427	0	a	So
4428	0	a	like the interface is really important .
4429	0	a	And easy to use , it it just so happens that from the second point to the third point is twice as important I mean the second point is twice as important as the third point .
4430	0	a	People want it I is
4431	0	a	it has to be cooler than easy to use ,
4432	0	a	you know ,
4433	0	a	if it has the newest features , even if it is difficult to use , prefer it to have the newest features .
4434	0	a	And if it is easy to use that is a bonus .
4435	0	a	The fashion , now this is seems a bit odd to me ,
4436	0	a	but fruit and veg is the new is the new black for furniture , for clothes , for shoes .
4437	0	a	How that relates to a remote control I do not know .
4438	0	a	But I I see
4439	1	a	I come on to that in the next in the next slide .
4440	0	a	Spongy .
4441	0	a	I have als I have been saying everything is the new black .
4442	0	a	Well
4443	0	a	spongy is the new black as well .
4444	0	a	So
4445	0	a	we have the choice between rubber and plastic .
4446	0	a	If it is the type of rubber that you can squeeze , you know , it is spongy , then can I skip the rest ?
4447	0	a	Okay .
4448	0	a	Oh yeah ,
4449	0	a	I forgot to mention that .
4450	0	a	The rubber material is the type of stress ball material , not just normal rubber .
4451	0	a	Okay ,
4452	0	a	so
4453	0	a	kind of spongy material .
4454	0	a	Forgot to say that .
4455	0	a	So so
4456	1	a	my personal opinion ?
4457	1	a	we want something fancy and techni technologically innovative , obviously .
4458	0	a	Okay .
4459	1	a	But what we what we need is something that looks like it is from the future that looks cool , that is that is different ,
4460	0	a	you know ,
4461	0	a	that is
4462	0	a	everyone has a white remote control , black remote control ,
4463	1	a	you need something cool .
4464	0	a	Like , titanium is cool
4465	0	a	but it is expensive .
4466	0	a	And maybe it is a bit of overkill for a remote control .
4467	1	a	now the fruit and veg options , either we we go in that direction or we stay totally away from it .
4468	0	a	I mean the research did come up with fruit and veg ,
4469	0	a	so maybe it is important
4470	0	a	for
4471	1	a	it is the up to the interface guy .
4472	0	a	So
4473	1	a	if we stay away from it , s you know stay away from it , but if we are going to go along with it then it does not necessarily have to be like an apple or something like that , or a kiwi fruit .
4474	1	a	It could be something like , I say potato peeler
4475	0	a	but I am sure you guys have a have a much cooler idea than I do .
4476	0	a	So
4477	0	a	I think cool is the key .
4478	0	a	Few questions about a spongy remote control .
4479	0	a	I have never seen one before .
4480	0	a	I have seen plastic remote controls .
4481	0	a	I think maybe they were
4482	0	a	I do not know ,
4483	0	a	back in the day when they first came up with remote controls , they had a reason for it being sturdy , you know .
4484	0	a	For being strong and sturdy .
4485	0	a	So
4486	1	a	if we want something strong and sturdy , I say stay with plastic or titanium ,
4487	0	a	but if we go with spongy , we can stress that you can drop this as many times as you want , it does not matter , it is spongy material , it is not going to break ,
4488	0	a	you know .
4489	0	a	I just do not know how the LED and the lights are going to fit into a spongy material because it is not going to be completely squeezable .
4490	0	a	So
4491	0	a	how do things fit it ?
4492	0	a	And if we are going to use spongy , we can say it is long lasting ,
4493	0	a	you know
4494	0	a	it is damage resistant and stuff like that ,
4495	0	a	so .
4496	0	a	So
4497	1	a	just to summarise ,
4498	0	a	people want stuff that is cool , that is that looks like it is cool , and if it is cool then that is a bonus
4499	0	a	does not have to be
4500	0	a	people like fruit and veg .
4501	1	a	We can either go down that alley or stay totally away from it .
4502	0	a	People like spongy material .
4503	1	a	If we are going to use spongy material we have to think of how practical it is , and how we can further promote that idea .
4504	0	a	And also , this was this year .
4505	0	a	So ,
4506	0	a	things change all the time , every year
4507	0	a	you know
4508	0	a	they they always talk about this year , this is the new black .
4509	0	a	Well
4510	0	a	next year something else is going to be the new black and we are stuck with last year is fruit and veg type stuff .
4511	0	a	Kay .
4512	0	a	Okay .
4513	0	a	That is me .
4514	0	a	Well ,
4515	0	a	I would say that the most you could probably hope for is gaining a year is lead on most people anyway .
4516	0	a	You always have to bring out new designs ,
4517	0	a	so if we can get next year then that is possibly a good place to start anyway .
4518	1	a	Seems like a a lot of the components could be off the shelf ,
4519	0	a	so
4520	0	a	I do not exactly what cost would be incurred .
4521	0	a	I can see your point about the number keypad ,
4522	0	a	but I have
4523	1	a	I would say that we can probably incorporate it into the menu system if you need to do traversal of a large number of channels .
4524	0	a	Yeah .
4525	1	a	My feeling would be that even if at a later date this was to be taking control of boxes as well
4526	0	a	having the use of the LCD and the joystick would probably allow you to manipulate enough channel numbers
4527	0	a	for you to be
4528	0	a	Yeah , actually
4529	0	a	if you have got a lot of channels , the number keypad can be quite annoying as well ,
4530	0	a	becau it is
4531	0	a	you know
4532	0	a	if you are trying to remember what , you know , what number is the discovery channel or whatever .
4533	0	a	It is just irritating .
4534	0	a	That is a good point .
4535	1	a	You can incorporate names into the menu .
4536	1	a	But if you h but but but if you have a me but if you have a menu structure , then you can sub group them .
4537	0	a	Okay .
4538	0	a	So you
4539	0	a	Yeah .
4540	1	a	Even news , music .
4541	0	a	Okay .
4542	1	a	Like they do on sky digital kind of .
4543	0	a	Yeah .
4544	0	a	So
4545	0	a	what it looks like to me is we will use a large number of standard components , ,
4546	1	a	say something like lithium ion battery ,
4547	0	a	the kind that you find in most small hand held devices now .
4548	0	a	Looks like we going for a double curved design .
4549	0	a	I do not know what cost implications there are in that .
4550	0	a	, looks like we are pretty much decided on some kind of flexible rubber .
4551	1	a	Though I would have to say depending on how flexible it is , we might need to have some kind of inner frame .
4552	0	a	Yeah ,
4553	0	a	I I would say definitely ,
4554	0	a	I mean I mean I mean
4555	0	a	the the idea of having it sort of articulated i th
4556	1	a	there would be basically two points of articulation .
4557	1	a	W one below and one above the m the the main sort of grip .
4558	0	a	Do you think there is any way we could maybe remove the articulation ?
4559	0	a	I can see why it looks appealing ,
4560	0	a	but it could be a weak point in the structure , do you think ?
4561	0	a	That would be a worry of mine .
4562	0	a	So
4563	0	a	If you are going with the fruit and veg thing , looks like a banana .
4564	1	a	F if you want to design it that way .
4565	0	a	I d I do not thi
4566	0	a	I do not think that it would be a a structural weakness ,
4567	0	a	I mean if you have a firm s sub structure , you can then incorporate articulation into that .
4568	1	a	If you then have a sort of outer skin of flexible , spongy rubber then you have something that is you know very much you know organic ,
4569	0	a	and I think would look rather co I mean mi rather cool .
4570	0	a	I mean my drawing there does not does not do it justice ,
4571	0	a	it makes it makes it look more a little bit more like a vibrator than a than a than a remote control ,
4572	0	a	but .
4573	0	a	Yeah ,
4574	0	a	we wo not add that functionality .
4575	0	a	Okay .
4576	0	a	Course not .
4577	0	a	However , one interesting point is ,
4578	0	a	I do not know how serious you were there ,
4579	0	a	but we
4580	1	a	if we take some of the ideas why do not we make the damn thing yellow to incorporate the des the colour of the logo ?
4581	0	a	I dunno .
4582	0	a	Yeah .
4583	0	a	Sure , yeah .
4584	0	a	Okay .
4585	0	a	It is an certainly a different colour from your average
4586	0	a	That is true .
4587	0	a	Make it harder to lose , as well .
4588	0	a	Yeah .
4589	0	a	Sure .
4590	0	a	Was there anything in your research
4591	1	a	The noise for when you lose the banana , f yeah , for when you lose the remote control , it could be like a a monkey noise or something like that , rather than a standard beep beep .
4592	0	a	Y you know ,
4593	0	a	you lose the monkey the banana , y you lose the banana ,
4594	1	a	you press a button , and you hear like monkey screams or something like that to direct you towards the banana .
4595	0	a	monkey .
4596	0	a	I th
4597	0	a	I mean if it
4598	1	a	I think that is something that could perhaps be programmable ,
4599	0	a	though maybe have monkey as default .
4600	0	a	S
4601	0	a	oh ,
4602	0	a	I was going to talk about the programmable remote control .
4603	0	a	Now I think it would be cool if you had one remote control that could work with all TVs ,
4604	0	a	you know
4605	0	a	you s you click a button
4606	0	a	and it finds the frequency that works with your particular television .
4607	0	a	But why you would need to program it like as as a standard feature ,
4608	0	a	I I do not know .
4609	0	a	Well basi basically
4610	0	a	the for f for
4611	0	a	I mean
4612	0	a	e each manufacturer will have a partic will have a particular command set that the TV responds to .
4613	0	a	It is not simply a matter of frequency .
4614	0	a	Yeah .
4615	0	a	So
4616	0	a	usually what is done is you have this big booklet full of different possi you will have all of them sort of programmed in to the remote , and you will have this little booklet of codes
4617	0	a	you then find your ma find your manufacturer and try the different codes that come under that manufacturer is name until you find the right one .
4618	0	a	That is because televisions , they do not give the remote control any type of feedback when you send it .
4619	0	a	Yeah , that is right .
4620	0	a	Okay .
4621	0	a	So
4622	0	a	that is that is quite annoying
4623	1	a	and we probably would still have to do that .
4624	1	a	But if we had some sort of hook up to your computer as an option , then if you have got a computer you can avoid that rather irritating thing .
4625	0	a	An interesting point is that if the person does not have the computer , we can still make the process easier
4626	1	a	because instead of having to look up codes , maybe we can have it that one of the options they have is that they look up the name of the company on the LCD and then they maybe look up different names of different actual units that have been produced .
4627	0	a	Yeah .
4628	0	a	Yeah .
4629	1	a	Or we have the remote control just go through them until it is like does this do the correct function , and such .
4630	0	a	Is it is it actually a book of names to digits , or is it like a few pages ?
4631	1	a	I was just thinking , if we were to store this information , some type of mapping .
4632	0	a	booklet .
4633	0	a	Some pages .
4634	0	a	This person probably need to use this feature like once , you know , when you first buy the remote control , or whenever they buy a new television ,
4635	0	a	so
4636	0	a	once every s
4637	0	a	Yeah ,
4638	0	a	and it is
4639	0	a	Yeah .
4640	0	a	Does not have to be used very often
4641	0	a	that is right , yeah .
4642	0	a	Yeah .
4643	0	a	But it is a
4644	0	a	but it is a nuisance .
4645	0	a	And it is a nuisance very close to the to to actually purchasing it ,
4646	0	a	so it is something that you are likely to be thinking about .
4647	0	a	If you if there is w i
4648	0	a	if there is one in the shop that is that says it can avoid much of that nuisance , you might be favourably inclined towards it .
4649	0	a	Okay ,
4650	0	a	this
4651	0	a	just to give us a rough idea of what we are meant to be doing for the next stage .
4652	0	a	I am pretty sure that you got that anyway .
4653	0	a	This is the conceptual one .
4654	0	a	I think we have come up
4655	0	a	I think we have covered everything we need to here .
4656	0	a	I think we have decided on what , you know , decided on standard items for most of rubber and such ,
4657	0	a	so
4658	0	a	we are now looking at the detailed design and what we need to be doing for the next meeting .
4659	0	a	So for example ,
4660	1	a	I will just start at the top ,
4661	0	a	you have got yourself and the Industrial Designer going to be working quite closely at this stage
4662	0	a	cause it will be hard not to , obviously .
4663	0	a	looking from prototyping of some des description using clay .
4664	0	a	I suppose you will be told a lot more about that as progress .
4665	0	a	The user interface design , They are kind of it looks they are the idea I have pushed forward so far is maybe more of a physical one there ,
4666	1	a	whereas possibly be more interested in maybe how the LCD is going to incorporate , do you think ?
4667	0	a	Or do you s perceive that most the design design decisions still need to be based on the physical layout ?
4668	0	a	, that is very true .
4669	0	a	well
4670	1	a	I I think other than ge getting a sort of more aesthetically pleasing form for it ,
4671	0	a	mo most of the sort of layout design decisions are are made , I would say .
4672	1	a	but then again , the the menu structure to to a considerable extent that is going to vary according to the model of television , and also any customisations that the user might wish to incorporate .
4673	0	a	So
4674	0	a	and one of the nice things about having an LCD and a menu structure is that there is that flexibility to it .
4675	0	a	Okay .
4676	0	a	got product evaluation as well .
4677	0	a	Yeah ,
4678	0	a	you see I do not
4679	0	a	some of these things kind of logically follow the others .
4680	0	a	How can t
4681	0	a	product evaluation , does not that come after actually seen a product prototype .
4682	0	a	I I think we would be
4683	0	a	yeah ,
4684	0	a	no , it would be more a case of how do we envisage us performing the product evaluation once we have a model to test with .
4685	0	a	Oh , that is the okay , sure sure sure .
4686	0	a	so
4687	1	a	it would be a case of
4688	1	a	do you think that just bringing users in to have them test it out , maybe putting a certain number of products into the field in certain places
4689	0	a	which I suppose is quite similar .
4690	1	a	Or just kind of hitting the streets
4691	1	a	and you know saying this is a new remote control
4692	1	a	, what do you think of the look of it ?
4693	1	a	I think the target audience is pretty much anybody under the age of say maybe sixty or something ludicrous .
4694	0	a	Okay , sure .
4695	0	a	At this stage we still have no no target audience
4696	0	a	or
4697	0	a	Kay .
4698	0	a	the reason I am saying that is we are just looking at a a replacement remote control , something that is stylish , so maybe you are even just maybe you are narrowing down your target audience simply by saying if they are buying it that often or they are maybe looking to replace something then , they have got a bit of free cash ,
4699	1	a	so that puts them potentially in the younger age bracket .
4700	0	a	And it is stylish .
4701	1	a	Maybe even single , just for the reasons of excess cash flow .
4702	0	a	Although of course I mean at twenty five Euros , I do not think we are looking at charging the earth for the device .
4703	0	a	Yep .
4704	0	a	Yeah .
4705	0	a	Think that is well within the normal bracket .
4706	0	a	Okay .
4707	0	a	your idea of the USB would I think would largely depend on the cost .
4708	0	a	USB is definitely one of the cheapest interfaces out there , but it might push the cost of the overall unit up cause it would require not just the connection but the chip for communicating with the rest of the system .
4709	0	a	That one might have to be based on
4710	0	a	The the idea was that maybe it could connect up for allowing a software interface on the PC for a larger programming due to the fact that we have gone for such a nice , easy minimal design , normally .
4711	0	a	Programmable memory as well .
4712	0	a	The USB for which ?
4713	0	a	Oh right
4714	0	a	, okay .
4715	0	a	For the remote control .
4716	0	a	We have w definitely talking some type of
4717	0	a	Different .
4718	0	a	But did not they just say it is just for TV ,
4719	0	a	or are we going to
4720	0	a	Okay , yeah .
4721	0	a	It is just for TV , but for programming it to use your TV , you might hook it up to the PC .
4722	0	a	I am not sure , but I am thinking maybe that the additional cost of the USB might be prohibitive .
4723	0	a	We do not know unless it would make sense to .
4724	1	a	But you are going to need some type of flash memory or something .
4725	0	a	Yeah ,
4726	0	a	I mean it is
4727	0	a	Yeah .
4728	0	a	Well
4729	0	a	something that does not
4730	0	a	you would not have to redo the whole thing once the batteries are changed , you know , once you turn off the power .
4731	0	a	Yeah .
4732	0	a	The other thing
4733	1	a	I mean it
4734	1	a	I mean it would need to ha
4735	1	a	it would need to have some sort of on board memory anyway .
4736	0	a	Yeah .
4737	0	a	f for one for one thing because I do think that the menu system should be
4738	0	a	I mean although you know , it is not going to be terribly complicated if it is just controlling one device ,
4739	1	a	the menu system ought to be o ought to be customisable
4740	0	a	and
4741	1	a	Different languages , different skins and stuff like that .
4742	0	a	W
4743	0	a	It would make sense to .
4744	1	a	How how how you want say the the the menu structure for flicking through channels if you have got lots of channels .
4745	0	a	Sure .
4746	0	a	I if it was customisable as in different languages and stuff , that does open
4747	0	a	it is supposed to be international ,
4748	0	a	right ?
4749	0	a	So .
4750	1	a	That sort of thing .
4751	0	a	It would make sense if you could
4752	0	a	Okay .
4753	0	a	I would say to .
4754	1	a	and we would better be careful about the time as well .
4755	0	a	We have already had the five minute warning ,
4756	0	a	so .
4757	0	a	I would say yeah .
4758	0	a	International would make sense .
4759	0	a	you are going to look at product evaluation .
4760	0	a	I am
4761	1	a	I would better start writing up a hell of a lot of crap .
4762	1	a	you are going to look a bit more at the kind of the physical make up you say .
4763	0	a	looks like we are going to need a maybe a kind of prototype in clay .
4764	0	a	Yeah .
4765	0	a	we will see how that goes .
4766	0	a	Are we going to be supplied with the clay is what I want to know .
4767	0	a	Where is the clay ?
4768	0	a	So
4769	0	a	do
4770	0	a	I think we have got an idea of where we need to go for the next meeting ,
4771	0	a	would you say ?
4772	0	a	Yeah , I would s that would be my my feeling .
4773	0	a	Yeah .
4774	0	a	they are going with the fashion thing , like the design , spongy rubber .
4775	0	a	The fruit and veg .
4776	0	a	This one .
4777	0	a	I th
4778	0	a	I think I would largely want to actually steer clear of the whole sort of fruit and veg thing .
4779	0	a	Bu but but the spongy idea I like .
4780	0	a	I like it a lot .
4781	0	a	We seem to have quite a general consensus that the idea of the the r rubber could be quite
4782	0	a	Yeah .
4783	0	a	Yeah .
4784	0	a	Yeah .
4785	0	a	I having it i having it sort of br bright yellow
4786	0	a	I think that is quite a good idea ,
4787	1	a	though maybe we could have options for colours as well .
4788	0	a	Yeah .
4789	0	a	and again this has the advantage of being harder to lose .
4790	0	a	Sure .
4791	0	a	I mean we are trying to promote a remote control , but we want to keep the company brand as well ,
4792	0	a	so .
4793	1	a	So we always need to remember that somewhere we are meant to be getting the slogan on .
4794	1	a	Possibly I am think I am not sure
4795	1	a	but I am seeing a little bit of space around maybe the joystick area which could be used .
4796	0	a	Yeah .
4797	0	a	I was like
4798	0	a	Okay .
4799	0	a	And I think that says it all really .
4800	0	a	I think so too .
4801	0	a	Right .
4802	0	a	 
4803	1	a	That should hopefully do the trick , .
4804	0	a	Kay .
4805	0	a	Sorry about the small delay .
4806	0	a	Falling a little bit behind schedule .
4807	0	a	And that is fifteen twenty five .
4808	0	a	Okay .
4809	0	a	So
4810	1	a	just to try and roughly go over what we agreed in the last one ,
4811	0	a	we are going to go for something how was it ?
4812	0	a	The new black , I believe .
4813	0	a	something that looks good cause that seems to be in preference to actual functionality in the end , though we should never avoid functionality , of course .
4814	0	a	many of our components are going to be standard , off the shelf , but it seemed like we were going to require at least an advanced chip
4815	0	a	and we were still very much for the idea of using an LCD display .
4816	0	a	other things were we were hoping to use rubber , most likely going to be double curved , etcetera .
4817	0	a	Okay .
4818	0	a	So
4819	1	a	due to your hard work , we might as well let the two designers go first , and show us the prototype .
4820	0	a	Okay ,
4821	0	a	it is a
4822	1	a	I think if we both step up and outline our ideas .
4823	1	a	Quite how the best way to do this is , I am not sure ,
4824	0	a	but
4825	0	a	Okay .
4826	0	a	Okay .
4827	0	a	Now
4828	0	a	do doing the prototype gave us a bit more insight into the ergonomics of the design .
4829	0	a	for one thing , it turned out that the only point at which it needs to be articulated for handedness is is h i is down here for the LED .
4830	0	a	As it turned out , the whole thing transfers from the right to left hand fairly well from the point of view of operating the function buttons and joystick ,
4831	1	a	though it might be an idea to be able to a adjust the positions for the base of the joystick just a little bit
4832	0	a	for
4833	0	a	ju just a thought .
4834	1	a	You could simply have a slightly ovoid shaped joystick that could then just be turn twisted round , so that the sticky so that the bit that sticks out a bit more is on one side or the other .
4835	0	a	But as you as you see with the with holding it in the left hand , the L the LCD is nowhere useful ,
4836	1	a	so that would need to be articulated if we are going to retain ergonomic design .
4837	0	a	now
4838	0	a	I I got your note about keeping the cost down .
4839	0	a	I am afraid
4840	0	a	yeah .
4841	0	a	Yeah .
4842	1	a	We will go into that a bit more , but please go on .
4843	1	a	this design could be done with with plastic casing .
4844	1	a	Though I would recommend around the grip part here in the middle , having maybe just a rubber grip over that
4845	0	a	which would allow for a slightly more sort of bio morphic form , and a bit more ergonomic as well .
4846	1	a	As for the as for the single curve , well this edge and this edge , like I say it would be nice to have some curvature to it ,
4847	0	a	but it is not absolutely necessary .
4848	1	a	Really the curve that is most needed is the underside
4849	0	a	so that the jo so that the joystick rests over the the edge of the hand like this .
4850	0	a	and you have the transmitter here and a wee speaker for the for the for the fi for the remote control finder .
4851	0	a	So .
4852	0	a	Any further comments ?
4853	1	a	obviously it is going to be bulkier than how it looks , because it is going to be flat on one side ,
4854	0	a	so the LCD will be s sticking down like this ,
4855	0	a	wo not it ?
4856	0	a	Cause it
4857	0	a	you ca not get it curved .
4858	0	a	Yeah .
4859	0	a	because of costs .
4860	0	a	Yeah , I mean
4861	0	a	the
4862	0	a	Yeah .
4863	0	a	And it is plastic as well ,
4864	0	a	so it wo not be as comfortable on the hand .
4865	0	a	Yeah .
4866	0	a	I mean with the with the rubber design it could i
4867	0	a	you know it could pretty much mould very much to the to the user is hand .
4868	0	a	One nice wee feature
4869	1	a	if we could if we could still do the rubber , I though of was to have the rubber extend beyond the end of the of the rigid substructure .
4870	1	a	So it has a wee sort of tail that you just drape over your wrist
4871	0	a	so it stays in position nicely .
4872	0	a	Lovely .
4873	0	a	Yeah , .
4874	0	a	Okay ,
4875	0	a	yeah .
4876	0	a	Great .
4877	0	a	Right .
4878	0	a	Yeah
4879	0	a	I have got a
4880	1	a	if you load up my evaluation document .
4881	0	a	Yeah , okay .
4882	0	a	Okay .
4883	0	a	Excellent work .
4884	0	a	evaluation .
4885	0	a	Basic point have a list of criteria that we need to rate the prototype by .
4886	0	a	then we will
4887	0	a	it is a seven s seven seven step kind of evaluation process .
4888	0	a	So
4889	0	a	not seven steps ,
4890	0	a	seven scale .
4891	0	a	So
4892	0	a	after we have finished doing all the ratings for each criteria , we average that and that will give us some type of confidence in our prototype .
4893	0	a	And the criteria based on Real Reactions' kind of goals and policies , marketing strategies , and also those I put together from the user requirements phase .
4894	0	a	Kay .
4895	1	a	if you flip the
4896	0	a	So ,
4897	0	a	those are the criteria .
4898	0	a	And perhaps I could have put them a bit better ,
4899	1	a	but you notice a few things that we have totally abandoned ,
4900	0	a	which means that the product will score very badly on some of those points .
4901	0	a	Put it mildly .
4902	0	a	So
4903	0	a	we have true ?
4904	0	a	One , t Seven , eight ,
4905	0	a	oh .
4906	0	a	Fourth .
4907	0	a	Okay , so
4908	0	a	we have to go through each point .
4909	1	a	If we imagine it is actually straight ,
4910	0	a	and just give it a a score .
4911	0	a	So
4912	0	a	how well would you say the prototype is
4913	0	a	how well have we realised the dream of being able to stop remotes from from being lost , or to be able to find them once they are lost .
4914	0	a	I mean , is the homing thing still the locator , is that still
4915	0	a	Sure .
4916	0	a	Yeah , that is still part of the design .
4917	0	a	And Adam , we can keep that in ?
4918	0	a	Okay .
4919	0	a	Yeah , I believe so .
4920	0	a	So
4921	0	a	I mean I do not think anybody could actually stop a remote being lost , cause that would mean doing something about the human element , but I would like to think that we have done something about finding the damn thing once we have .
4922	0	a	Sure .
4923	0	a	T
4924	0	a	Sure .
4925	0	a	And making it a bright colour helps
4926	0	a	with the
4927	1	a	personally I would have gone for purple .
4928	0	a	Bright colour .
4929	0	a	So
4930	0	a	we still have that noise thing ,
4931	0	a	yeah ?
4932	0	a	Os
4933	0	a	on a scale of one to seven , how would you guys rate it for finding finding it once it is lost ?
4934	0	a	Number one ?
4935	0	a	Okay .
4936	0	a	I would say number one .
4937	0	a	One .
4938	0	a	Yeah .
4939	0	a	Number number one for the first criteria .
4940	0	a	I think w if it was just the sounder then th
4941	0	a	I mean something I have found with w w
4942	0	a	with say tr trying to find a cordless phone or a m mobile , you can hear it , but you ca not quite pin it dow pin down where it is .
4943	0	a	Yeah
4944	0	a	you can tell what room
4945	0	a	the mobile is
4946	0	a	Yeah .
4947	1	a	What about what if the the volume on the TV is turned up massively and you just want to turn down the volume ca not find remote .
4948	0	a	Bu
4949	0	a	Yeah .
4950	1	a	Suppose you have to go to the TV and do it manually .
4951	0	a	Yeah .
4952	0	a	Like y you would not hear the speaker .
4953	0	a	just before we go through all of the steps here , well what we will do is
4954	1	a	if we can look at the criteria you are going to evaluate , and then we will come back to the product evaluation
4955	0	a	if that is alright .
4956	0	a	You want to say something ?
4957	0	a	That is fine .
4958	0	a	Yeah , is that
4959	0	a	so
4960	0	a	is there anything here that you that you wanted to cover as in the criteria that you have covered ?
4961	1	a	And then we will come back pretty much promptly to this .
4962	0	a	Oh that is that is fine .
4963	0	a	What do you mean
4964	0	a	cr is there anything I want to
4965	0	a	, a few .
4966	0	a	I is there any of these criteria that need any explaining ?
4967	0	a	Or is there anything that yous thought tha really would stand out compared to the others ?
4968	0	a	Okay .
4969	0	a	Something I neglected from my initial research is that Real Reactions has a a goal strategy that all of the products be inspired by material fashion , and clothing fashion .
4970	0	a	That is why fruit and veg being popular in the home and in clothing was important and they want all their products to be somehow inspired by current trends in fashion .
4971	0	a	So they say we put the fashion in electronics ,
4972	0	a	well
4973	0	a	they really mean it
4974	0	a	they
4975	0	a	they are very big on fashion ,
4976	0	a	so .
4977	0	a	That is this bit right here .
4978	0	a	And this bit is this one easy to use for visitors or for anybody ?
4979	0	a	I guess it is just the same as saying easy to use interface , so it is kind of condensed into one .
4980	0	a	And we can come back to it , you said .
4981	0	a	So .
4982	0	a	Okay .
4983	0	a	No
4984	1	a	and which we will do very very shortly .
4985	0	a	Okay .
4986	0	a	Slight problem we had was that we have an amazing four Euros over budget for what we were hoping to do .
4987	0	a	most of it stems from the use of the LCD which I think in the end accounted for about half of our expenditure because of course we required a chip as well .
4988	0	a	the only way to get this down was either to ditch the a LCD , at which point we have removed a large part of how we were going to interface , require more buttons , etcetera .
4989	0	a	Or what we did was that we we as in I as I was quickly going over it was altering the actual structure .
4990	0	a	changing it to plastic and a solid unit with a single curve design would allow us to come back into the proposed costs and we are just scraping it in , we have got point two of a Euro left over there .
4991	0	a	So we are just managing it really .
4992	0	a	Even then as well , there was no criteria technically defined for a joystick
4993	0	a	so I have used what I think is appropriate .
4994	0	a	With any luck that wo not mean that we have incurred more cost than we can actually afford to .
4995	0	a	It blows a lot of our really good ideas kind of slightly to one side , for example the possibility of having a USB connection is definitely not viable now .
4996	0	a	Different languages ?
4997	0	a	Yeah .
4998	0	a	That should still be viable .
4999	0	a	We have got an advanced chip , we have got the use of the LCD .
5000	0	a	So being able to communicate in multiple languages is still very much a possibility .
5001	1	a	but what is something we need to decide on is how we are going to go from here .
5002	1	a	We do need to try and come up with an idea which could be continued with other people if need be .
5003	0	a	We can
5004	1	a	I can bring the excel up sheet up and show you if you wish .
5005	0	a	I really think as m much as it pains me
5006	1	a	is that we might have to go with plastic and some kind of solid design ,
5007	0	a	possibly meaning that the LCD would not be in this perfect place .
5008	0	a	It might be s stuck like slightly between what would be good for left handed and what would be good for a right handed person .
5009	1	a	I suppose o one thing that could be done is h is have it circular and have it s so that the the pink actually goes a bit over the pinkie finger .
5010	0	a	Okay .
5011	0	a	So that th
5012	0	a	It very much is about making concessions , unfortunately .
5013	0	a	Do you have any data on how much different prints cost ?
5014	0	a	I mean can you get the entire thing printed with a design ?
5015	0	a	b b b da is you mean on the plastic , or ?
5016	1	a	Let is have a look .
5017	0	a	You now have as much information as I do .
5018	0	a	Yeah ,
5019	0	a	yeah .
5020	0	a	So
5021	0	a	as you can see here , for example , the battery really not very little choice in that one .
5022	0	a	We have gone for one of the cheaper options as well .
5023	0	a	Unfortunately we require the advanced chip if we are going to do what we are needing to .
5024	0	a	I have said single curved .
5025	0	a	We really do need it to be that way for the ergonomics of it .
5026	0	a	plastic for some reason incurs no cost , which I have had to very much make advantage of , despite the fact that rubber is only got a value of two Euros per unit .
5027	0	a	Problem comes here as you can see in the interface .
5028	1	a	if I have read this thing correctly , then we can save point five of a Euro here in that it is not per push button .
5029	0	a	That might make sense ,
5030	0	a	because then a numeric keypad would come in at what , four point five Euros ,
5031	0	a	which is an awful lot , so that could well be wrong .
5032	1	a	Even if we save point five there , it would just mean that we are most likely placing it in actually just gaining a colour for the unit ,
5033	0	a	which has had to be put to one side .
5034	0	a	As you can see , the use of an LC display advanced chip and what would determine the scroll wheel here as well
5035	0	a	because it is an integrated scroll scroll wheel push button that was not quite what I think they had in mind with a joystick .
5036	0	a	Why would why would that be more expensive than an individual push button and scroll wheel together ?
5037	0	a	That is quite significantly expensive .
5038	0	a	I
5039	1	a	that is something you will have to take up with the bean counters .
5040	0	a	as you can see I mean that is taken up well over half of the price .
5041	0	a	yeah .
5042	0	a	Yeah .
5043	0	a	So
5044	1	a	I am very much open to suggestions of where we go ,
5045	0	a	but because we need to shed what was four Euros off of the the price of for what we really desired , this one comes in under price as you can see , but this was the one that sacrificed the material for the case and for the actual case design .
5046	0	a	We do not even have speakers here .
5047	0	a	The
5048	0	a	like
5049	0	a	we
5050	0	a	what about speakers and transmitters and stuff like that ?
5051	0	a	Have we factored that in ?
5052	0	a	Transmitter , receiver , speakers .
5053	0	a	no , we have not , not
5054	1	a	That will it literally would just be a button .
5055	0	a	Plus the extra device itself that is going to be on a TV .
5056	1	a	Is that going to be a button , or
5057	0	a	Yeah .
5058	0	a	That is too expensive
5059	0	a	is not it ?
5060	0	a	Yeah .
5061	0	a	We might have to It looks like almost nothing
5062	0	a	Oh
5063	0	a	good call ,
5064	0	a	I missed that .
5065	0	a	I I mean it is not on here ,
5066	0	a	but .
5067	0	a	that is a very valid point .
5068	0	a	Did they s
5069	0	a	do we have to use an advanced chip for the LCD ?
5070	0	a	Okay .
5071	0	a	Well
5072	0	a	that is yeah .
5073	0	a	So if we are going to go with the LC display , then that is
5074	0	a	I believe so , yeah .
5075	0	a	What is a hand dyna dynamo ?
5076	0	a	You have to wind it up ?
5077	0	a	Technology .
5078	0	a	That would probably not be in keeping with the the fashion statement and such , yeah .
5079	0	a	Fashion .
5080	0	a	Yeah .
5081	0	a	Okay .
5082	0	a	So basically
5083	0	a	the only new thing is the LCD on the remote now .
5084	0	a	Being manipulated by the joystick , yeah .
5085	0	a	Oh , and joystick ,
5086	0	a	yeah .
5087	0	a	Which I am defining as scroll wheel .
5088	0	a	And we could not replace the joystick ,
5089	0	a	right ?
5090	0	a	Because we would need four extra buttons to replace it , up down left and right , and that would be more expensive
5091	0	a	than a
5092	0	a	but is a scroll wheel not just back and forward ?
5093	0	a	Yeah .
5094	0	a	Yeah it is just because there was no actual definition for what a joystick might be , that that is what I have labelled it for the purposes of this evaluation .
5095	0	a	So
5096	0	a	The LCD basically is the big selling point of the remote .
5097	1	a	If we remove the LC display , we could save ourselves a fair amount .
5098	0	a	Which you could
5099	0	a	It is a shame .
5100	0	a	But that is what makes it original though ,
5101	0	a	is not it ?
5102	0	a	It can be s
5103	0	a	yeah ,
5104	1	a	it can still be single curved ,
5105	0	a	but You just .
5106	0	a	I think if we remove the the LC display then there was absolutely no point to any of these meetings
5107	1	a	and we just we could just put our branding on any other remote control .
5108	0	a	Yeah .
5109	0	a	Yeah .
5110	0	a	k Does this does this bear in mind that
5111	0	a	I mean it is a bit ridiculous
5112	0	a	that they are going to charge us what is it , like this much money for three million if we are going to buy three million components ,
5113	0	a	you know .
5114	0	a	We should possibly have
5115	1	a	If we could have increased the price we could have manufactured that
5116	1	a	and we could have got something far closer to what we were hoping to .
5117	1	a	Again , you will have to argue with the accountants on that one .
5118	1	a	but for the purposes of this meeting , I am we are going to have to stick with these figures .
5119	0	a	Kay .
5120	0	a	So ,
5121	1	a	I would say that it would seem like the general opinion is we are going to keep the LC display
5122	0	a	cause it is about what really separates us , despite the cost it is going to incur .
5123	0	a	I think so .
5124	0	a	are people maybe not happy with , but are willing to go ahead with this in going for a plastic solid case , to keep the LCD ?
5125	0	a	It is hard to tell .
5126	0	a	yeah
5127	0	a	I mean
5128	1	a	one thing ,
5129	0	a	I mean ho how much extra would it be to to keep
5130	0	a	I mean keep the the articulation ?
5131	0	a	This is what I am wondering .
5132	0	a	I would say that you are at least going to take double curved , and even then I am not quite sure if that is incorporating the idea of articulation .
5133	0	a	Yeah .
5134	0	a	Oh
5135	0	a	no , I think I I it
5136	0	a	d that it need not require it to be double curved .
5137	1	a	It is it is just it is just it is just that the case would come in t would be made in two parts and then joined together with an articulation .
5138	0	a	Single curved with articulation ?
5139	0	a	But the curves all o over hand ,
5140	0	a	is it ?
5141	0	a	We would not actually save a lot by reducing it anyway ,
5142	1	a	so I mean for the purposes of this meeting maybe we can state that single curve still allows articulation .
5143	1	a	Could we could we not get rid of the curvy the curvous the curvaceousness and focus on the menu being the best interface ?
5144	0	a	Cause like we
5145	0	a	do we have re restrictions on software ?
5146	0	a	Oh
5147	0	a	but there has to be
5148	0	a	joystick .
5149	0	a	That is what we need for the joystick I think though .
5150	0	a	Yeah , I mean
5151	0	a	and I mean the
5152	1	a	I mean if you look if you look closer at the at the prototype here ,
5153	0	a	the lines here along the grip are actually quite straight .
5154	0	a	I mean
5155	0	a	yeah ,
5156	0	a	on the on the LCD I mean although we have done it with a curve it
5157	1	a	could just as easily be done without curves .
5158	1	a	The curve that is really needed is up here ,
5159	0	a	to put to keep the joystick in a good ergonomic position for it to have it rest on the top of the hand .
5160	0	a	Okay .
5161	0	a	Sure .
5162	0	a	Okay ,
5163	0	a	my bad .
5164	0	a	unless we hear otherwise we could go ahead with that proposal .
5165	0	a	So
5166	0	a	I think the product is not going to perform so well for my criteria .
5167	1	a	Which is what we can get onto now .
5168	0	a	As long as so are we going to say w
5169	1	a	we have to keep an eye on the time as well , but we are going to say single curved design
5170	0	a	It could well be ,
5171	0	a	but at a cost of
5172	0	a	Okay ,
5173	0	a	yeah
5174	1	a	we will definitely wo not go with that one .
5175	0	a	Oh ,
5176	1	a	wait a minute .
5177	0	a	Sample speaker ?
5178	0	a	What is a sample speaker ?
5179	0	a	Is that somewhat similar to what we want ?
5180	0	a	Yeah .
5181	0	a	no that is that voice response thing that we got the email about .
5182	0	a	Costs four .
5183	0	a	But I thought it was just completely pointless .
5184	0	a	You got a email about voice response ?
5185	0	a	I did not ,
5186	0	a	so .
5187	0	a	Yeah .
5188	0	a	Alright .
5189	0	a	B
5190	0	a	i basically it was saying that our labs had come up with a chip that you could , you know , say hello to , and it would say hello back in a friendly female voice .
5191	0	a	We wo not go with that one , did you say ?
5192	0	a	I mean I
5193	0	a	we
5194	0	a	Okay , okay .
5195	0	a	Yeah , that is voice recognition , so .
5196	0	a	So , okay yeah ,
5197	1	a	battery definitely ,
5198	0	a	It looks like it unless we can manage to put it in under point two Euros , .
5199	0	a	So
5200	1	a	it looks like we are going to get rid of the whole loca locator thing .
5201	0	a	Yeah .
5202	0	a	Okay .
5203	0	a	Okay .
5204	0	a	Maybe even slight
5205	0	a	well
5206	0	a	oh yeah , pretty much point
5207	0	a	two Euros , I would say .
5208	1	a	So we will leave that one for now .
5209	0	a	we will just have It is a case of
5210	0	a	I am slightly unsure .
5211	0	a	Are we going for a special colour at all ?
5212	0	a	Well
5213	0	a	I was for a case .
5214	0	a	One point five of a Euro for one push button does not sound quite right .
5215	0	a	So maybe it is a case of a push button is maybe one or more .
5216	0	a	At which point if
5217	0	a	Well
5218	0	a	you got point five there .
5219	0	a	Or had you already incorporated that ?
5220	0	a	Think it is ten minutes left .
5221	0	a	Oh , special colour for the case .
5222	0	a	It is literally a case of whether or not this is correct .
5223	0	a	I am not quite sure if they are
5224	0	a	I do not think they mean point five Euros per button .
5225	0	a	Okay , well
5226	1	a	l let is say that
5227	1	a	and then we can have our special coloured case
5228	0	a	and then we at least have make it a little harder to lose .
5229	0	a	So
5230	0	a	There we go .
5231	0	a	Because most m most remotes are a fairly dingy colour
5232	0	a	that gets camouflaged under any pile of crap in a living room .
5233	0	a	W what is the default colour ?
5234	0	a	White or black ?
5235	0	a	Right .
5236	0	a	Black is probably the normal colour you would say ,
5237	0	a	yeah .
5238	0	a	Or grey .
5239	0	a	I quite like that colour that you are fetching there ,
5240	0	a	it is definitely for
5241	1	a	make it glow in the dark even better .
5242	0	a	Yellow .
5243	0	a	Yeah .
5244	0	a	So
5245	0	a	will we go with that then ?
5246	0	a	It is not and we can see
5247	1	a	we will come back to your evaluation
5248	0	a	which you are probably now going to pan us
5249	0	a	but there we go .
5250	0	a	Okay .
5251	0	a	Yeah .
5252	0	a	Sure .
5253	0	a	Okay .
5254	0	a	Okay .
5255	0	a	So
5256	0	a	Right okay .
5257	1	a	Just to give you an idea , you want to go maybe a bit quickly as well ,
5258	0	a	I am not sure how much time .
5259	0	a	We have not hit the five minute mark warning yet ,
5260	0	a	but .
5261	0	a	Okay .
5262	0	a	Ten .
5263	0	a	Kay .
5264	0	a	Ability to stop remotes from being lost or to find them once they are lost .
5265	0	a	Okay .
5266	0	a	Special colour .
5267	0	a	Special colour .
5268	0	a	four ?
5269	0	a	Three ? .
5270	0	a	four .
5271	0	a	Three if we are being generous , I feel .
5272	0	a	Three .
5273	0	a	I think we can do three .
5274	0	a	Three .
5275	0	a	Think we are being generous here with three .
5276	0	a	Th the special colour does not would I think make a difference .
5277	0	a	It makes it stand out
5278	0	a	from
5279	0	a	you know
5280	0	a	it is lost in a big pile of crap , it stands out from the rest of the crap .
5281	0	a	Yeah .
5282	0	a	Okay .
5283	0	a	Okay .
5284	0	a	Reduce the number of unused buttons .
5285	0	a	We are down to t two buttons ,
5286	0	a	is it ?
5287	0	a	Okay ,
5288	0	a	so that is a one .
5289	0	a	Two buttons .
5290	0	a	Two buttons and a joystick .
5291	0	a	You know ,
5292	0	a	where that is
5293	0	a	Okay ,
5294	0	a	that was good .
5295	0	a	Totally .
5296	0	a	Yeah .
5297	0	a	I would say we are doing well there .
5298	0	a	Easy to use interface , buttons menu , menus
5299	0	a	that is
5300	0	a	yeah
5301	0	a	that is good .
5302	0	a	Kay
5303	0	a	that is
5304	0	a	we are not doing so badly .
5305	0	a	easy to use
5306	0	a	oh okay ,
5307	1	a	let is forget that one .
5308	0	a	Fancy looking .
5309	0	a	As he models the I would
5310	0	a	Yeah .
5311	0	a	It does not get much fancier .
5312	0	a	Sure .
5313	0	a	And we could do whatever we like with the L LCD .
5314	0	a	Yeah
5315	1	a	let is just assume it is a good LCD display .
5316	0	a	Maybe I was panicking for no reason .
5317	0	a	Are we going one on ?
5318	0	a	I would say we go two ,
5319	0	a	cause like f the fanciest would be the double curved .
5320	0	a	Yeah ,
5321	0	a	w maybe you would be a bit too
5322	0	a	yeah .
5323	0	a	Would not it ?
5324	0	a	With the articulators .
5325	0	a	There we go .
5326	0	a	Yeah ,
5327	0	a	that is m
5328	0	a	that is that is better too .
5329	0	a	With bells on it .
5330	0	a	More accurate numbers .
5331	0	a	Technologically innovative .
5332	0	a	Well ,
5333	1	a	we are getting rid of the locator thing
5334	0	a	which which
5335	0	a	yeah
5336	0	a	Which is a shame .
5337	0	a	I would give it a three for this for that .
5338	0	a	No need for teletext .
5339	0	a	Yeah .
5340	0	a	I mean the menus thing is something you do not normally see on on a remote , but you see it in a lot of other places .
5341	0	a	Kay .
5342	0	a	Yeah ,
5343	0	a	mobile phones .
5344	0	a	And y what you are doing is moving the menu from the television to the remote control ,
5345	0	a	so it is
5346	0	a	You say three ?
5347	0	a	I might go as far as two on that .
5348	0	a	Three .
5349	0	a	I would give it a three .
5350	0	a	I would be tempted with three , yeah .
5351	0	a	Three .
5352	0	a	Okay .
5353	0	a	Okay .
5354	0	a	We will get panned on the next one , anyway .
5355	0	a	Materials that people find pleasing .
5356	0	a	Sponginess is what they really would have wanted , apparently .
5357	0	a	Yeah ,
5358	0	a	w
5359	0	a	It is , yeah .
5360	0	a	Do not blame them .
5361	0	a	because of the way that we have minimalised the number of buttons and such .
5362	0	a	Yeah .
5363	0	a	Plastic , it sucks .
5364	0	a	But it is no worse than any of the other pl remote controls we have .
5365	0	a	That is true .
5366	0	a	It is not a step backwards .
5367	0	a	five ?
5368	0	a	Six ?
5369	0	a	Six , .
5370	0	a	I would s I
5371	0	a	I would give it a six , to be honest .
5372	0	a	Yeah , okay let is give it a six .
5373	0	a	Okay ,
5374	0	a	that is totally thrown everything off balance .
5375	0	a	Inspired by the latest interior and clothing fashion .
5376	0	a	W we could .
5377	1	a	What colour were we going to make it ?
5378	0	a	I know ,
5379	0	a	but
5380	0	a	But by this I think it is more a case of fruit and veg ,
5381	0	a	Yeah .
5382	1	a	Put a leopard print on it .
5383	0	a	Well
5384	1	a	I
5385	1	a	I
5386	1	a	I would sa
5387	1	a	I would say give a s give a selection of colours .
5388	0	a	we went with yellow
5389	0	a	we went with yellow for the prototype cause we had yellow .
5390	1	a	If I were buying one , I would go for purple .
5391	1	a	Leopard print would be cool .
5392	0	a	Yeah
5393	0	a	we gotta .
5394	0	a	I would say the colour of the border there world you would find that , that is that would stand out .
5395	1	a	Like yellow ,
5396	0	a	yeah .
5397	0	a	It would also help keep the the product placement
5398	0	a	s
5399	0	a	yeah .
5400	0	a	Logo , brand .
5401	0	a	kay .
5402	0	a	But Th th they are referring to the fruit and veg thing .
5403	0	a	Is it inspired by clothing fashion ?
5404	0	a	Yes .
5405	0	a	Is this like a banana type colour ?
5406	0	a	Could we stretch
5407	0	a	no still ,
5408	0	a	it is not shaped like a banana is
5409	0	a	Oh
5410	0	a	is that cause it is flat ?
5411	0	a	What is what fruit or veg is flat ?
5412	0	a	Yeah .
5413	0	a	It is kind o it
5414	0	a	probably
5415	0	a	Well
5416	0	a	I mean it is probably more fruit and veg than most other things out there bar fruit and veg ,
5417	0	a	so , what , four ?
5418	0	a	Is that being too generous ?
5419	0	a	Oh dear , .
5420	0	a	That is kind of i
5421	0	a	it wo not be when it is been budgeted .
5422	0	a	I
5423	0	a	I think s
5424	0	a	I
5425	0	a	I think this is not not particularly fruit and veggie .
5426	0	a	Or we might have to suffer badly for this one as well .
5427	0	a	Yellow courgette .
5428	0	a	Four ?
5429	0	a	Oh that is it is very ambitious ,
5430	0	a	yeah , .
5431	0	a	I would I would I do not think fruit and veg is the sole criterion .
5432	0	a	Sure .
5433	0	a	Is the sole criterion for being fashion fashionable or inspired by current fashions .
5434	0	a	Inspired by .
5435	0	a	I would g
5436	0	a	I would rate I would rate this fairly highly from that point of view actually .
5437	0	a	Well
5438	0	a	this this what we are going to t this is their motto , like .
5439	0	a	Yeah .
5440	0	a	And we are we are not doing well on it .
5441	0	a	This is their strategy .
5442	1	a	I m imagine we actually had some money invested in this
5443	0	a	and the amount that we invest is going to be proportional to the marks .
5444	1	a	Might we might want to be a bit more skepible sceptical about this one .
5445	0	a	What would you think yourself ?
5446	0	a	Well ,
5447	0	a	it is kind of curved
5448	1	a	and we can make it yellow ,
5449	0	a	and that is pretty much banana like .
5450	0	a	I would say
5451	0	a	I mean it is it is not at all , right ?
5452	0	a	In any way or shape or form .
5453	0	a	We did not m
5454	0	a	Okay , the the yellow banana like thing is I think is okay .
5455	0	a	Si
5456	0	a	it is got a curve to it .
5457	0	a	Right
5458	0	a	five .
5459	0	a	Is that sound reasonable ?
5460	0	a	Five .
5461	0	a	Am I
5462	0	a	do you think I am stretching the the use of the banana ?
5463	0	a	It is not bad
5464	0	a	and considering the
5465	0	a	do not pick the pen .
5466	0	a	Yeah , I will go with five .
5467	0	a	Yeah .
5468	0	a	Kay , so
5469	0	a	we have one , two , three , four , five , six , seven .
5470	0	a	So five , seven , ten , sixteen , twenty one .
5471	0	a	Which gives us an average of three .
5472	0	a	It is
5473	0	a	well
5474	0	a	this would be in the middle .
5475	0	a	So we
5476	0	a	it is it is not bad .
5477	0	a	It is in the good section .
5478	0	a	Oops .
5479	0	a	Sorry .
5480	0	a	I am I am sorry .
5481	0	a	Y
5482	0	a	oh and you have knocked batteries out .
5483	0	a	right okay
5484	0	a	it is
5485	0	a	considering the price we had to get this in , to have a positive you know , even based on the four of us being heavily biased , it was going to be quite hard to get anything standing out I would say possibly , based on the the cost features .
5486	0	a	Is bad design , that thing .
5487	0	a	Yeah .
5488	0	a	, yeah .
5489	0	a	Even if we were to increase this entire thing by by seven , we were to go down a grade to to four ,
5490	0	a	we would have to do
5491	0	a	I mean we did not
5492	0	a	we were not that kind of optimistic too optim overly optimistic .
5493	0	a	You know like
5494	0	a	we did not we did not add
5495	0	a	we did not subtract a whole seven points from these things ,
5496	0	a	so I think we are definitely on the good bit .
5497	0	a	Even if we gave this one seven and this one seven , that is still only three extra points over seven .
5498	0	a	You know ,
5499	0	a	it is
5500	0	a	yeah ,
5501	0	a	we did it w
5502	0	a	it was okay .
5503	0	a	It was good .
5504	0	a	Personally , I think given that the product only replaces a single remote control that you have already got ,
5505	0	a	are people really going to shell out twenty five Euros for something that is only marginally good ?
5506	0	a	Well ,
5507	0	a	it depends who your who is what the target people are , like you would say maybe the fashion conscious women would be going , oh look at that , is cool ,
5508	0	a	it looks like a
5509	0	a	it is yellow , looks like a banana , it is cool
5510	0	a	it is gotta look good in the sitting room .
5511	0	a	Maybe it is been targeted
5512	0	a	Hide it in the fruit basket .
5513	0	a	Rather than the LCD
5514	0	a	whereas more technical like like more people in with the latest technology it is good , it is got an LCD screen is only got two buttons and a joystick .
5515	0	a	So ,
5516	0	a	which which kind of people would be more likely to buy it ?
5517	0	a	Probably the people technologically .
5518	0	a	They are usually the ones that buy pointless stuff .
5519	0	a	I think so .
5520	0	a	I mean my mum still has not learnt how to use text messaging on her phone , and she is had it for a long time ,
5521	0	a	you know .
5522	0	a	She uses it to make phone calls and that is it .
5523	0	a	Yeah .
5524	0	a	So
5525	0	a	I think if sh if my mum saw a remote control like this with only two buttons and a joystick , I mean that will probably be the first one she decides not to buy ,
5526	0	a	you know .
5527	0	a	She would be like is this a remote control ,
5528	0	a	I do not
5529	0	a	how do you use it , and stuff like that .
5530	0	a	So even if it is really user friendly to us , but we are used to using menus all the time .
5531	0	a	I s
5532	0	a	I suppose one thing is that b because it is technically innovative , for someone who is sort of technophobic , the fact that it simply looks unfamiliar would be daunting .
5533	0	a	Yeah .
5534	0	a	Yeah .
5535	0	a	I think it is totally radical to have a remote control with no no numbered buttons ,
5536	0	a	yeah .
5537	0	a	Yeah .
5538	0	a	Yeah .
5539	0	a	But like radical good , maybe .
5540	0	a	Okay .
5541	0	a	do not know how lo much longer we have got .
5542	0	a	At least five minutes I think .
5543	1	a	quickly we will pop onto project evaluation .
5544	0	a	So ,
5545	0	a	we have got these four criteria here for satisfaction .
5546	0	a	Does anybody want to do you have any opinions on any of them ?
5547	1	a	For example we will work backwards I suppose .
5548	0	a	The ability to work on this project using the technology we have been presented with .
5549	0	a	people made good use of the pen and paper ?
5550	0	a	I would say
5551	0	a	I am not quite sure what the advantage for us using a digital pen might be .
5552	0	a	Yeah , got notes and doodles .
5553	0	a	Yeah .
5554	0	a	Wrote nearly a page ,
5555	0	a	but not .
5556	0	a	I think tracking .
5557	0	a	Well
5558	0	a	I think this is a
5559	0	a	I think the digital pen is mostly for the benefit of the of the researchers studying this .
5560	0	a	It is all p goes into their corpus .
5561	1	a	Though it would have been nice to be able to transfer the transfer our n our paper notes onto the computer ourselves .
5562	0	a	It must
5563	0	a	It does seem like the paper is still a heavy consideration for taking notes .
5564	0	a	Yeah , that woulda been pretty good .
5565	0	a	So maybe this is literally just a way around it .
5566	0	a	I dunno .
5567	0	a	How are people satisfied with the teamwork we have managed to display today ?
5568	0	a	Leadership .
5569	0	a	Good .
5570	0	a	I would
5571	0	a	yeah
5572	0	a	I liked it , yeah .
5573	0	a	As much as can be leadered in this thing .
5574	0	a	Very good .
5575	0	a	I li
5576	0	a	yeah , top marks .
5577	0	a	last one we have got is room for creativity .
5578	0	a	Well yeah .
5579	0	a	Now ,
5580	0	a	I think we got
5581	0	a	Yeah
5582	0	a	I think of in the end , ideas that can be used sadly .
5583	0	a	Unti until until accounts came along , squish .
5584	0	a	We are burs bursting with creativity .
5585	0	a	We we are not lacking in ideas ,
5586	0	a	you know
5587	0	a	it is
5588	0	a	that was not the problem .
5589	0	a	Not so much that we were not full of ideas , but of ones that are going to allow us to actually build the thing .
5590	0	a	It is a bit of a pity .
5591	0	a	I would have to agree on that .
5592	0	a	I think we needed a larger budget .
5593	0	a	Yeah .
5594	1	a	If you are going to aim your a product maybe at the technological kind of sector , then you can afford to maybe jack the price up slightly from what it is .
5595	0	a	Because they will pay outrageous cash to first on the market .
5596	0	a	Yeah .
5597	0	a	I mean I th
5598	0	a	I mean I think to r retaining the s the more sort of bio morphic form in the articulation would gain more in s would gain more profit in sales than it would lose in in added expense .
5599	0	a	And the price was like it was twice the w assembly cost .
5600	0	a	And would it have to be twice that ?
5601	1	a	It could be like coulda had the assembly like maybe fifteen Euro .
5602	0	a	It could even
5603	0	a	That is true , yeah .
5604	1	a	We will still settle for twenty five .
5605	0	a	Maybe .
5606	1	a	I suppose these are all that will have to be taken up with a at a different group at I guess .
5607	1	a	As to a the costs involved .
5608	0	a	But I mean we have got a a prototype .
5609	0	a	Such as it is .
5610	0	a	So
5611	0	a	I dunno , I
5612	0	a	I think it is gone okay today , considering the information that we have had at our disposal , and such .
5613	1	a	Maybe the counts wou woulda been better if we had a list or more
5614	1	a	Yeah , to begin with .
5615	0	a	Yeah .
5616	0	a	Probably would have
5617	0	a	mean we could have come up with a lot more solid design in the end ,
5618	0	a	I would have to agree .
5619	0	a	Yeah .
5620	0	a	It is very much a pity to get so far into the stage and then find out that maybe some of your ideas are just a bit too expensive .
5621	0	a	Always hard to tell until you know the costs .
5622	0	a	Okay .
5623	0	a	Are the costs within budget ?
5624	0	a	Well ,
5625	0	a	they are now
5626	0	a	that we have our slightly less than capable product .
5627	0	a	Okay .
5628	0	a	We have evaluated it , and we can say that we came out with a value of three .
5629	0	a	Yeah .
5630	0	a	Actually I want th
5631	1	a	one thing I would say
5632	1	a	I mean something that could perhaps be part of the product the m product testing market research process would be to produce mock ups of both versions and see just how much of a difference the over going over budget m would make to sales .
5633	0	a	It is
5634	0	a	yeah ?
5635	0	a	And then the final one where you get to call it Hal .
5636	0	a	And like response from consumers .
5637	1	a	And we could even you know , market two versions .
5638	1	a	Wee cheapie version with the nice bio morphic rubber .
5639	1	a	But we will go into that later .
5640	0	a	Yes .
5641	0	a	Sure .
5642	0	a	Right
5643	0	a	is there anything else that anybody would like to to add , anything they think that is not been covered ,
5644	1	a	before I quickly write up a final report .
5645	0	a	I dunno ,
5646	0	a	I mean we have got a product .
5647	0	a	We maybe are not as happy with it as we would like to be ,
5648	0	a	but we have got something we think we can maybe stick onto the the market and sell .
5649	0	a	And of course something we have been avoiding talking about cause of we have no information is selling them directly to the manufacturers .
5650	0	a	Yeah .
5651	0	a	There is a huge market .
5652	0	a	I mean we have briefly touched on it
5653	0	a	but we have no more knowledge
5654	0	a	then there is little we can say on that .
5655	0	a	Yeah .
5656	0	a	Yeah .
5657	0	a	So
5658	1	a	unless anybody is got anything they would like to add , we can maybe round this up slightly earlier than we would need to
5659	1	a	and then we can finish up the writing and such .
5660	1	a	And I can get my bus .
5661	0	a	Yeah ?
5662	0	a	thank you for your participation .
5663	0	a	Okay .
5664	0	a	Yeah .
5665	0	a	Okay , let is
5666	0	a	Thank you .
5667	0	a	I was actually kind of upset you know at the budget , and that we had to cut a lot of stuff .
5668	0	a	It is like man , we we ca not have the locator thing .
5669	0	a	And s
5670	0	a	yeah that is just bad .
5671	0	a	 
5672	0	a	Are we
5673	0	a	we are not allowed to dim the lights so people can see that a bit better ?
5674	0	a	Okay , that is fine .
5675	0	a	Yeah .
5676	0	a	Am I supposed to be standing up there ?
5677	0	a	Okay .
5678	0	a	So we have got both of these clipped on ?
5679	0	a	She going to answer me or not ?
5680	0	a	Right , both of them , okay .
5681	0	a	Yeah , I have got
5682	0	a	Yes .
5683	0	a	God .
5684	0	a	Jesus , it is going to fall off .
5685	0	a	Okay .
5686	0	a	Yep , yep .
5687	0	a	Okay .
5688	0	a	Okay .
5689	0	a	Tu tu tu tu
5690	0	a	Hi , good morning .
5691	0	a	Hello everybody .
5692	0	a	I am Sarah , the Project Manager and this is our first meeting , surprisingly enough .
5693	0	a	Okay , this is our agenda , we will do some stuff , get to know each other a bit better to feel more comfortable with each other .
5694	0	a	then we will go do tool training , talk about the project plan , discuss our own ideas and everything and we have got twenty five minutes to do that ,
5695	0	a	as far as I can understand .
5696	0	a	Now , we are developing a remote control which you probably already know .
5697	0	a	, we want it to be original , something that is people have not thought of , that is not out in the shops , , trendy , appealing to a wide market , but you know , not a hunk of metal , and user friendly , grannies to kids , maybe even pooches should be able to use it .
5698	0	a	Okay , , first is the functional design , this is where we all go off and do our individual work , what needs need to be fulfilled by the product , what effects the product has to have and how it is actually going to do that .
5699	0	a	, conceptual design , what we are thinking , how it is going to go and then the detailed design , how we are actually going to put it into practice and make it work .
5700	0	a	Kay .
5701	0	a	Okay , right .
5702	0	a	We are going to practice with the pens and draw our favourite animal on the white board ,
5703	1	a	I will go first ,
5704	0	a	and sum up the characteristics of that animal .
5705	0	a	So
5706	1	a	Okay , I will leave space for everyone else .
5707	0	a	Oops .
5708	0	a	What is missing ?
5709	0	a	We are running out of blue .
5710	0	a	Okay .
5711	0	a	I am not going to ask you to guess , I am going to tell you that is supposed to be a tiger .
5712	0	a	And I see them as majestic , and independent , and proud .
5713	0	a	Oh sorry .
5714	1	a	Now , who would like to go next ?
5715	0	a	Kay .
5716	1	a	Yeah , me .
5717	0	a	Cat .
5718	0	a	Where did this come from ?
5719	0	a	, yep .
5720	0	a	Is that your lapel then ?
5721	0	a	There you go .
5722	0	a	Thank you .
5723	1	a	, maybe you can guess what I am trying to make ?
5724	0	a	Yep .
5725	1	a	A kind of dog ?
5726	0	a	Sorry ?
5727	0	a	It is actually sitting , so it is sitting , it is not standing .
5728	0	a	It is sitting down .
5729	0	a	Okay , I see it as one thing it is very supportive .
5730	0	a	It is your best friend and your you can talk to a dog , it can be your best friend , it does not discriminate between you , based on what you are .
5731	0	a	Second it is loyal and third thing it is got intuition .
5732	0	a	dogs can som sometimes can make out between a thief and a person so basically these are the three unique features I think belong to a dog .
5733	0	a	Okay , thank you .
5734	0	a	Thank you .
5735	1	a	Yeah I will have a go .
5736	0	a	Okay .
5737	0	a	Sorry .
5738	0	a	Please , please leave me a space at the bottom , I am little ,
5739	0	a	you can get to the top , with standing on a chair .
5740	0	a	Thanks .
5741	0	a	Alright , okay .
5742	0	a	Well since you guys have chosen the ones I wanted to do , I will have to have to go for something a bit random .
5743	0	a	Okay .
5744	0	a	Does it look like a dog actually ?
5745	0	a	And also , my drawing skill is not that great
5746	0	a	so
5747	0	a	, yeah .
5748	0	a	Well , as you can see , the quality of the work today is
5749	1	a	Gonna be a bird .
5750	0	a	I think it is outstandingly good .
5751	0	a	Okay , now I am going to have to change what is was originally going to be because that looks like a beak now , so .
5752	1	a	Crocodile ?
5753	0	a	O Beauti that is
5754	0	a	Okay .
5755	0	a	Yeah , it can be a crocodile , it can be a crocodile .
5756	0	a	Is it going to be
5757	1	a	it is going to be a bird .
5758	0	a	Well it was it was an at first
5759	0	a	firstly it was an attempt at a T Rex and then it sort of changed into a pelican but it can be a crocodile now actually .
5760	0	a	That is lovely .
5761	0	a	Yeah and I will have to think on the spot of things that it is .
5762	0	a	scary , strong , yeah
5763	0	a	that is about it I think .
5764	0	a	Okay it is fine .
5765	0	a	, I am very impressed with your artistic skills ,
5766	0	a	mine is are dreadful .
5767	0	a	Wo
5768	0	a	Oops this is now coming apart ,
5769	1	a	let me just put the top in .
5770	0	a	I hope that clicks in ,
5771	1	a	I will just I will hold it on , okay .
5772	0	a	Oops , oh dear ,
5773	0	a	what happened there ?
5774	0	a	Hopefully that will stay on ,
5775	0	a	two handed version .
5776	0	a	Technical help .
5777	0	a	Okay .
5778	0	a	Okay ,
5779	0	a	Again this is off the top of my head , I was going to do a big cat too , .
5780	0	a	S
5781	1	a	Okay , some sort of bird
5782	0	a	Oh dear ,
5783	0	a	it does not look
5784	0	a	what like what I want it to be .
5785	0	a	It is not a vampire bat honestly .
5786	0	a	Okay , yeah .
5787	0	a	and somewhere there is a body behind .
5788	0	a	That is my dreadful
5789	0	a	that is the worst yet ,
5790	0	a	that is
5791	0	a	it is meant to be an eagle you can tell it is a flying animal
5792	0	a	could have been a seagull ,
5793	0	a	I never thought of a seagull .
5794	0	a	A seagu
5795	0	a	right , not a seagull .
5796	0	a	eagle
5797	0	a	, right okay .
5798	0	a	Eagle , okay .
5799	0	a	An eagle , again I am thinking on my feet goodness .
5800	0	a	I suppose they are all so independent ,
5801	1	a	I would put that one down again .
5802	0	a	Da dum .
5803	0	a	They are good at golf .
5804	0	a	Indepen independent , right ,
5805	0	a	did you say they are good at golf ?
5806	0	a	Are they ?
5807	0	a	Oh .
5808	0	a	Yeah , no yeah , an eagle .
5809	0	a	Eagle .
5810	0	a	Oh right , okay ,
5811	0	a	I am not good at golf .
5812	0	a	I would say they are quite free spirited , flying around everywhere , doing their own thing .
5813	0	a	And , birds of prey are not they ,
5814	0	a	oh dear ,
5815	0	a	intrepid .
5816	0	a	I will put that , intrepid .
5817	0	a	There we go ,
5818	0	a	hope that pen is going to be okay .
5819	0	a	That is lovely .
5820	0	a	Whoops .
5821	0	a	Okay .
5822	0	a	That was fun ,
5823	0	a	right .
5824	0	a	finance wise , we have got a selling price at twenty five Euros , which I do not actually know what that is in Pounds , at all .
5825	0	a	Any ideas ?
5826	1	a	D fifteen ?
5827	0	a	Seventeen .
5828	0	a	It is about
5829	0	a	, yeah .
5830	0	a	Seventeen .
5831	0	a	One point four or something like that .
5832	0	a	One point four Euro would make a Pound or something like that .
5833	0	a	Yeah ,
5834	0	a	yeah ,
5835	0	a	something like that ,
5836	0	a	so that
5837	0	a	yeah about seventeen , seventeen Pounds , something like that .
5838	0	a	Yeah .
5839	0	a	Seventeen Pounds .
5840	0	a	Okay , that is expensive .
5841	0	a	Should we be making notes of this ?
5842	0	a	We can just refer to this later ca not we ?
5843	0	a	Yeah , okay .
5844	0	a	But
5845	0	a	Havi having said that though , if you want to get one of those the the ones on the market at the moment they are s they are about twenty pounds anyway .
5846	0	a	I think so , I think so ,
5847	1	a	I will be able to pull it up , or I could put it in the shared folder or something .
5848	0	a	Okay .
5849	0	a	So , it would still be
5850	0	a	yeah , we had to buy one .
5851	0	a	Right .
5852	0	a	Really ?
5853	0	a	So
5854	1	a	so I suppose later it depends if we want to undercut the price ,
5855	0	a	we d or
5856	1	a	or is it going to make our product look a cheapie cheapie option ?
5857	0	a	I think
5858	0	a	Yeah ,
5859	0	a	production cost is at twelve fifty , so half of the selling price is taken up by building it .
5860	0	a	Okay , pretty huge margin .
5861	0	a	Yeah .
5862	0	a	, and profit aim is fifty million Euros ,
5863	0	a	which is
5864	0	a	Yi yes ,
5865	0	a	yeah ,
5866	0	a	I presume so .
5867	0	a	In our first year ?
5868	0	a	So then
5869	0	a	You have got market range international and you did say earlier it is got to be a accessible and usable by sort of all age groups just t we are not focusing on business market , any particular thing , it is everyone user friendly to everyone .
5870	0	a	No
5871	0	a	, yeah .
5872	0	a	Okay .
5873	0	a	Big target group .
5874	0	a	So
5875	0	a	yes , yes ,
5876	0	a	I do not think we have to
5877	0	a	I do not think it is a case of worrying about different languages and things like that , making that a key point , just that it is going to be in the international market like Australia , America , things like that .
5878	0	a	No .
5879	0	a	Okay .
5880	0	a	What are your experiences with remote controls ?
5881	0	a	I mean I have got we got we had three videos , a TV and a sort of amp thing all
5882	0	a	set up
5883	0	a	so we got one of the universal remote controls , that you programme each of your things into , but that kept losing the signals so we would have to re programme it every now and again .
5884	0	a	Yeah .
5885	0	a	Alright .
5886	0	a	Yeah .
5887	0	a	Yeah ,
5888	0	a	that c
5889	0	a	Okay ,
5890	1	a	you want to integrate everything into one like
5891	0	a	Okay .
5892	0	a	I think it was quite a cheapie as well , so that might have had something to do with it ,
5893	0	a	but that was quite good , the fact that you could You did not have six remote controls sitting in front of you .
5894	0	a	Yeah
5895	0	a	Use all the ones at the same time .
5896	0	a	Right .
5897	0	a	Yeah ,
5898	0	a	cause you
5899	0	a	Yeah .
5900	0	a	My experience has only been being given the remote control with the object I buy , not doing any tampering with it and programming , using it to programme TV and videos and things .
5901	0	a	But basically on , off , volume up and down , channel one , two , th that basic functions ,
5902	0	a	I do not think I could go any further with it than that ,
5903	1	a	so , I suppose it is got to be something usable by someone like me as well .
5904	0	a	Yeah ,
5905	0	a	the main that is the main stuff anyway , I mean
5906	0	a	and you do not want to
5907	0	a	I hate I hate looking at a control and seeing a million tiny little buttons with tiny little words saying what they all do and just sitting there searching for the teletext button or something like that .
5908	0	a	And symbols that you do not necessarily understand , symbols you are meant to understand that you do not .
5909	0	a	Yeah .
5910	1	a	So simplification of symbols you could think of .
5911	0	a	When they are
5912	0	a	when you have got the main things on the front of it and a section opens up or something to the other functions where you can do sound or options kind of recording , things like that inside it .
5913	0	a	Oh yeah .
5914	0	a	Cause it does not make when you pick it up it does not make it really complicated to look at , it is obvious what you are doing , .
5915	1	a	Actually that just raises a point ,
5916	0	a	I wonder what our design people think ,
5917	0	a	but you know on a mobile phone , you can press a key and it gives you a menu , it is got a menu display ,
5918	1	a	I wonder if incorporating that into the design of a remote control might be useful , so you have got a little LCD display .
5919	0	a	Menu , alright .
5920	0	a	Yeah .
5921	0	a	Right ,
5922	0	a	I was thinking on the same lines you ,
5923	1	a	instead of having too many b buttons and make it complicated for the user , may h maybe have an LCD di display or something like that ,
5924	0	a	like a mobile , yeah and with menus .
5925	0	a	With menus , yeah ,
5926	0	a	yeah .
5927	1	a	And if it is s somewhat similar to what you have on mobile phone , people might find it easier to browse and navigate also maybe .
5928	0	a	Yeah .
5929	1	a	What about the older generation ?
5930	1	a	What about granny and grandads ?
5931	0	a	, my grandad can answer his mobile phone , but he could not even dream of texting or something like that .
5932	0	a	You mean to save it lesser number .
5933	0	a	Yeah .
5934	0	a	Can he programme his remote control or is it basic with that too ?
5935	0	a	Right .
5936	0	a	Right .
5937	0	a	I do not think they tape things ,
5938	0	a	I do not think they use
5939	0	a	, yeah , the age gap .
5940	0	a	Yeah , my grandad is actually better than me at using teletext , so
5941	0	a	Right .
5942	0	a	So that is a problem regardless of of any design modifications you you come up with , that is going to be a problem anyway with the older generation perhaps ,
5943	0	a	Yeah .
5944	0	a	Yeah , what it just needs to be as long as it is sort of self intuitive and you can can work out what everything is doing , cause I mean , menus on sort of new phones now they have sort of got all these pictures and stuff which makes it fairly obvious what you are trying to do .
5945	0	a	I do not know ,
5946	0	a	I d
5947	0	a	I do not like the , you know the new phones that have kind of got a Windows based running system .
5948	0	a	But I do not know how
5949	0	a	Oh yeah .
5950	0	a	I find it really confusing ,
5951	0	a	I kept getting lost in the phone ,
5952	0	a	I di
5953	0	a	I have not got a new one
5954	0	a	but my friend got a new one
5955	0	a	and I was trying to do things with it
5956	0	a	and I just kept getting lost ,
5957	0	a	but that is just me .
5958	0	a	Right .
5959	0	a	Yeah , I do not I do not know how for twenty fi , or twelve Euros fifty
5960	0	a	how much of a excellent screen you could get , you would you would have to sort of keep it down to a black and white LCD thing anyway , I would assume .
5961	0	a	Yeah .
5962	1	a	Is it possible that that for the older generation you could have like an extra button that you press for large print like you do in large print books ?
5963	0	a	Obviously it displays less on the screen , it displays less on the screen but as long as they can read it that is the main thing .
5964	0	a	Okay .
5965	0	a	Teletext has got that option as well .
5966	0	a	Yeah .
5967	1	a	Or what about kind of a dual function ?
5968	1	a	In that you have got the basic buttons just for your play , volume , programme things and also and then a menu to go into with obvious pictures , obvious symbols and that is where you control recording and things like that .
5969	0	a	Yeah .
5970	1	a	The other thing is , just ch chucking into mobile phone f design features again , it could have a flip top remote control so that when you flip over the top , your screen is you can have a bigger screen in the the flip over .
5971	0	a	, okay .
5972	0	a	I think that is a cost thing , I do not I do not know how much we are going to know about
5973	0	a	Yes , no that is important .
5974	0	a	S
5975	0	a	It might
5976	0	a	it might save a b bit of space , it is i instead of looking bulky , it might look small .
5977	0	a	Y
5978	0	a	Yeah .
5979	0	a	Yeah ?
5980	0	a	Yeah , like smaller .
5981	0	a	But it might have its cost implications .
5982	0	a	Okay .
5983	0	a	And there is no reason we need to make it look as fashionable and stylish as a mobile phone , it can still be lightweight plastic , you know ?
5984	0	a	Something that is easily moulded and produced .
5985	0	a	Right .
5986	0	a	Yeah .
5987	0	a	Sorry I am treading on your territory guys .
5988	0	a	No
5989	0	a	Yeah .
5990	0	a	, right , okay
5991	0	a	we have got half an hour before the next meeting , so we are all going to go off and do our individual things .
5992	0	a	I think that is probably about it
5993	0	a	and then we will come back and liaise again
5994	0	a	and I get to do another fantastic PowerPoint presentation .
5995	1	a	Just just a quick thing about the about what you are saying about the does does it need to be fashionable ?
5996	0	a	The sort of
5997	0	a	I I had a quick look at the company website and it is like the the
5998	0	a	we put the fashion into electronics ,
5999	0	a	so I think think the whole design thing might be qui
6000	0	a	I mean you do not you
6001	0	a	you can still have plastic
6002	0	a	and it would look quite good but
6003	0	a	Yeah .
6004	0	a	Sure .
6005	0	a	right .
6006	0	a	Okay .
6007	0	a	Okay .
6008	0	a	Okay .
6009	0	a	Sure b
6010	0	a	y
6011	0	a	yeah .
6012	0	a	But yeah , I mean it does not have to be that , you know th that was my main point
6013	0	a	, we do not have to use metal , I do not know if using plastic does make it cheaper , I presume it would .
6014	0	a	Yeah .
6015	0	a	Yeah ,
6016	0	a	yeah ,
6017	0	a	yeah .
6018	0	a	I would it would probably .
6019	0	a	Yeah .
6020	0	a	I mean there is Sky remote controls and everything .
6021	0	a	They are kind of moulded and look a bit different , and the Telewest remote controls are silver plastic ,
6022	0	a	which looks a bit smarter , so
6023	0	a	yeah
6024	0	a	I guess that is stuff we can think about .
6025	0	a	Right .
6026	0	a	Okay .
6027	1	a	Okay , so let is break it up there .
6028	0	a	Kay .
6029	0	a	Okay ?
6030	0	a	So , see you in half an hour .
6031	0	a	 
6032	0	a	Help .
6033	0	a	It is up there ?
6034	0	a	That screen is black .
6035	0	a	Alright , okay .
6036	0	a	Okay , that is fine .
6037	0	a	Oh God .
6038	0	a	Are we done ?
6039	0	a	Right , okay ,
6040	0	a	this is our second meeting and I might be a bit all over the place .
6041	1	a	, right our agenda for today ,
6042	0	a	do you want us to give you a second ?
6043	0	a	Okay ,
6044	1	a	I will go over what we decided last meeting ,
6045	0	a	we decided upon a universal control , one handset for all , TV , video equipment .
6046	0	a	, no that is okay ,
6047	0	a	sorry .
6048	0	a	Sorry .
6049	0	a	, that it was important that the product was accessible to a wide range of consumers , wide age range , not limiting anyone .
6050	0	a	We decided it was important to reflect the company is image in our product , we put fashion in electronics , you know
6051	0	a	that kind of s thing .
6052	0	a	, our budget would have to affect
6053	0	a	try not to reflect our budget , that we might have a bit of
6054	0	a	oh oh you can see it , okay .
6055	0	a	dissonance between what our budget was and what we want it to look like .
6056	0	a	want it to look uncluttered , undaunting to the customer .
6057	0	a	We discussed a flip open design , reducing the size of the control and an electronic panel for further features like programming , things like that .
6058	0	a	Okay .
6059	0	a	three presentations , I have got written here so
6060	1	a	shall we hear from Marketing first ?
6061	1	a	No that is fine , that is fine .
6062	1	a	is it okay
6063	1	a	if I postpone that til later ,
6064	0	a	I just want to get access to a little bit more information ,
6065	0	a	is that okay ?
6066	1	a	Okay ,
6067	1	a	yeah
6068	1	a	I will go first .
6069	0	a	Can I grab the
6070	0	a	Thanks .
6071	0	a	Unplug me .
6072	0	a	What do I have to press ?
6073	1	a	Oh , F eight ?
6074	0	a	Oh right , yeah .
6075	0	a	, FN function F eight .
6076	0	a	Okay .
6077	0	a	Maybe
6078	0	a	Yep there we go .
6079	0	a	Yep .
6080	0	a	Okay this is the working design , presented by me , the Industrial Designer extraordinaire .
6081	0	a	Kay , this is where I went a bit mad with PowerPoint so .
6082	0	a	What the first thing question I asked was what are we trying to design ?
6083	0	a	Well , a device which basically just sends the signal to the TV to change its state , whether that be the power , or the channel or the volume , everything is just some sort of signal to change the state of the TV or other appliance that it is sending the signal to .
6084	0	a	, so I decided I would have a look at what th other people have designed and try and take some inspiration from that .
6085	0	a	But although we will want to be taking ideas from other people , we want to make sure that our design stands out and I thought that was something that well it was not really my area because I am dealing with the inside really .
6086	0	a	So , yeah I ran out of time so I could not do this one as fun as the last one .
6087	0	a	and I found out that most controls use some form of infrared to send signals to the TV presumably because of the cost issue of something like the same thing that computers use , wireless
6088	0	a	and , you do not need to send very much information .
6089	0	a	, most of them are powered by some form of battery .
6090	1	a	Now our one , I am I am not sure whether we want to look at the size issue
6091	0	a	because most of them are powered by triple A batteries but those can be quite bulky
6092	1	a	so I d I did not know if you wanted to look at something else so we could shrink down the size of the control .
6093	0	a	Could I can I interject to ask a question there , is that appropriate ?
6094	0	a	You are saying the triple A batteries are small or the surrounding it ?
6095	0	a	Yeah sure .
6096	0	a	no no , if you if you look at if you look at most remote controls they are quite they are quite chunky and that is because of the size of the batteries , they have to be obviously this certain size to fit those batteries in .
6097	0	a	Right ,
6098	0	a	the triple As are the smallest you can get are they not , right ?
6099	0	a	Oh I see .
6100	0	a	Yeah
6101	0	a	the the
6102	0	a	well you can you can get the sort of circular round ones
6103	0	a	but I am just wondering about power consumption and how much you need to send the data across .
6104	0	a	They are .
6105	0	a	Okay .
6106	0	a	Okay .
6107	0	a	, and d which leads sort of onto the next point about them being small and easy to carry round .
6108	0	a	, now the ones at the moment are small
6109	1	a	but I was just wondering if we could look at something a bit smaller .
6110	0	a	Now the main components I came up with were obviously the power source for the batteries cause otherwise it is not going to work ,
6111	1	a	as I said about the w which batteries we were going to choose , we can discuss that later
6112	0	a	and then you obviously need something to decode the information that you are putting in from from the controller
6113	0	a	Now these have a wireless range of up to about five metres which is sort of suitable for anyone who is watching the TV unless they are in a cinema , which not most people do so as we are applying to the most audience that should be fine .
6114	0	a	And then I was just had a quick look at the external design
6115	0	a	but I d I left that mostly to the interface designer .
6116	0	a	And so this is what I had as the basic idea of what we want to do .
6117	0	a	It is not a proper circuit ,
6118	0	a	I am not sure if it would work or not , I am not even confident that those are the real the real way you would wire it up
6119	0	a	but anyway ,
6120	0	a	we have just got the the power going to the infrared bulb with the chip and the UI interface which would basically , when you when you pressed anything it would the chip would convert it into some form of IR data which could be decoded by the TV receiver , which obviously means that we are going to have to conform to whatever whatever form of communication that the TVs are already using and since that that is another use and reason to use that infrared because that is what all TVs use at the moment .
6121	0	a	And then finally , we want the it to be available to a wide audience at a low cost so all the components that I have put forward are low in cost
6122	0	a	so that that should be good .
6123	0	a	it should should be different enough from the alternative products to get a good consumer base , we were talking about it before and also just something that I was thinking about ,
6124	1	a	because they are small they are also easy to lose so if we could look into some way of d dunno some anti going down the side of the sofa thing that you could have ,
6125	0	a	I th that was just sort of a general point there .
6126	0	a	And that is
6127	0	a	yeah .
6128	0	a	That is a very important part ,
6129	0	a	it came up in our market research findings too
6130	0	a	so I can refer to that , whenever you like me to present .
6131	0	a	Alright okay ,
6132	0	a	and yeah , that is that is what I came up with there ,
6133	1	a	so if you want to
6134	0	a	Ooh .
6135	0	a	Okay , thank you very much .
6136	1	a	, would you like to continue on from that ?
6137	1	a	Or , maybe move the laptop over .
6138	1	a	Yep .
6139	0	a	Kay .
6140	0	a	It can be
6141	0	a	okay , that is okay with me .
6142	0	a	further .
6143	0	a	Oops .
6144	0	a	Why is it not working ?
6145	0	a	F eight , right ?
6146	0	a	Okay .
6147	0	a	F function .
6148	0	a	Function F eight
6149	0	a	yeah .
6150	0	a	why is it in the right ?
6151	0	a	Yeah , it is connecting .
6152	0	a	No .
6153	1	a	The plug has not come out at the bottom , has it ?
6154	1	a	No .
6155	0	a	No , no
6156	0	a	yeah it is just .
6157	0	a	Meter adjusting .
6158	0	a	Oh , there .
6159	0	a	okay .
6160	0	a	Yeah .
6161	0	a	Actually some of my points might overlap with what William is just mention , but basically my method was like whatever brainstorming we did in the last meeting , just a couple of valuable points and started developing on that and there might be some missing loops in this thing which I think we will take a feedback from the marketing because , I have not had some marketing data and basically every product is marketable .
6162	0	a	Yeah .
6163	0	a	So purpose , as William already said , I would put it to simplify the interaction with TV to make make it as simple as possible .
6164	0	a	And to summarise I I would say it is it should be user friendly by being easy to use , rather than having a lot of complex button because you can have an engineering maybe having hundred buttons and maybe having a remote control which has the main features like volume control or channel ch changing the channel or whatever .
6165	0	a	But we are to to make it unique so that people want to buy it , will this two features together .
6166	1	a	So what the concept is to have a flip top model .
6167	1	a	The main functions such as which are like often used will be on the top and the complex functions which say you you can say like the y young generation or trendy generation want to pr say programme their favourite channels or whatever , can be put in the middle part of the f flip top .
6168	0	a	So it is like it could be accessed by a wide ra range of audience
6169	1	a	and we can punch in new f features such as added features such as shock proof body and maybe a design to appeal to a lot of people .
6170	0	a	Findings most people prefer us user friendly rather than complex remote controls because there are times like people have used a remote control for say a year or something and they they are not used maybe thirty to forty percent of the buttons so it is not of no use of punching in the trying to put in those things in on the top of the remote control and try to confuse the user .
6171	0	a	As we saw we we have to make a profit also
6172	1	a	so we we can maybe go for an economies of a higher production
6173	0	a	by fifty million we said ?
6174	0	a	Yeah ,
6175	0	a	with that I think we will be able to achieve economies of scale also , so we can give in add in more features and make it less costly .
6176	0	a	Yeah .
6177	0	a	, that is so this is
6178	0	a	if you ask me personally , I would make flip top with a trendy design
6179	1	a	and s maybe we we should look at also like the buttons whe whether they are like soft or little hard
6180	0	a	because they are times when the buttons tend to be a bit hard after continuous use usage and all that .
6181	0	a	Yeah .
6182	0	a	So in overall a simple and user friendly design .
6183	0	a	any comments like , if you want ?
6184	0	a	Okay .
6185	0	a	Kay .
6186	1	a	, I think we will chat about it at the end ,
6187	1	a	okay so if anyone wants to write something down that they want to bring up at the end ,
6188	0	a	Ooh , it is vibrating , that is strange .
6189	0	a	Kay .
6190	0	a	Yeah sure .
6191	0	a	Oh , God .
6192	0	a	Right , okay .
6193	0	a	Have I got to keep this here ?
6194	0	a	Does it matter ?
6195	1	a	I will have t I will have to move it wo not I ?
6196	0	a	, whoops .
6197	0	a	I think you will have to
6198	0	a	You ca not It will have to
6199	0	a	this ca not be pulled .
6200	0	a	We just do the best we can .
6201	1	a	You will have to push it a bit more .
6202	0	a	Will it manage ?
6203	0	a	Bit more ,
6204	0	a	oh dear .
6205	0	a	Yep .
6206	0	a	Yeah this is more than enough .
6207	1	a	There we go ,
6208	0	a	I have got a bit more of the cable .
6209	0	a	Okay .
6210	0	a	Oh .
6211	0	a	There we go .
6212	0	a	Is that okay ?
6213	0	a	Thank you ,
6214	1	a	just pull it closer a little bit .
6215	0	a	Yeah
6216	1	a	I think you can pull it out now .
6217	0	a	you should be able to and
6218	0	a	yeah , there you go .
6219	0	a	Yeah , you might .
6220	0	a	Get it right over ,
6221	0	a	okay , thank you .
6222	0	a	Look at that .
6223	0	a	Okay , ,
6224	0	a	I am going to look at the functional requirements from the marketing point of view and obviously our starting point with marketing is always market research .
6225	0	a	, so that is where we started , we used our our usability lab , the company is usability lab , we did our usual selection methods to get a cross section of the general public , male and female , all age groups from fifteen upwards
6226	0	a	and we observed them in the lab , just their general use of the remote control , you can see we had a hundred subjects there .
6227	0	a	Our findings , lots of findings , I have just summarised some of them here .
6228	0	a	The overall thing which I have I have got at the top there in italics is that users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls , so it has obvious design implications there .
6229	0	a	, we found that seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly .
6230	0	a	Eighty percent would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy ,
6231	0	a	we were quite surprised by that finding ,
6232	0	a	but that is quite a high proportion of our our , you know , international target group are prepared to spend more money for something that is a bit nicer looking .
6233	0	a	, current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user overall .
6234	0	a	For example , you can see below there , seventy five percent of users zap a lot , so you have got your person sunk back in the sofa channel hopping .
6235	0	a	Yeah .
6236	0	a	So again there is power implications there .
6237	0	a	, fifty percent of users only use ten percent of the buttons , so again a big design issue there .
6238	1	a	and possibly we can also cut back on cost if we do not have so many functions actually on the remote control .
6239	0	a	the biggest frustrations that people found with regard to personal preferences were something that you you mentioned earlier , remote controls are often lost in the room , it is a slipping down the back of the sofa type of thing , fifty percent were were particularly frustrated by that .
6240	0	a	thirty four percent of people take said they take too much time to learn to use
6241	0	a	and I think that ties in with the the previous finding of people only using ten percent of the buttons , they just ca not be bothered to learn about the other functions .
6242	0	a	, slightly more than a quarter of people said it was bad for repetitive strain injury .
6243	0	a	You know those small movements of the remote control can lead to kind of shoulder and elbow problems .
6244	0	a	the vast majority of the thirty five and under age group would like a liquid crystal display and speech recognition , again that was to aid
6245	0	a	I think in when they have lost the actual remote control , some kind of speech recognition .
6246	1	a	Something we did not put to them , but which I am thinking of now is even if perhaps the lost control can give off a bleep every now and again til you find it or a flashing light , possibly .
6247	0	a	, that trend reverses in the older age groups .
6248	0	a	So thirty fives and unders who would like those two features , that kind of evens out thirty five to forty five and in the older age group it kind of reverses , they are not so bothered with this .
6249	0	a	I had marvellous tables and things that I could show you , but I think I will just keep it simple ,
6250	1	a	if there is any more information I can email you extra details ,
6251	0	a	is that okay ?
6252	0	a	so can we not programme a video with this remote control ?
6253	0	a	Just channel hopping .
6254	0	a	Kay .
6255	0	a	Okay .
6256	0	a	Okay .
6257	0	a	Yeah .
6258	0	a	That is fine .
6259	0	a	Right ,
6260	0	a	we have new project requirements , we are not going to be using teletext , apparently the consumers consider it outdated with the internet now .
6261	0	a	Huh .
6262	0	a	Okay .
6263	0	a	our control is only going to be for TV , it is not going to be a combined control , which limits you know all of the different things that it limits the cost for us , but it also makes it easier to understand for the consumer .
6264	0	a	It says for TV only , so looks like it is just
6265	0	a	yeah ,
6266	1	a	I think maybe Sky things like that might be incorporated into it , but
6267	0	a	I do not know , what do you think ?
6268	0	a	It just said , for TV only .
6269	0	a	Would that imply video use ?
6270	0	a	, yes .
6271	0	a	But I mean , general TV controls do do video as well .
6272	0	a	T
6273	0	a	yeah
6274	0	a	yeah .
6275	0	a	I d well
6276	0	a	I dunno cause the w if you have g
6277	0	a	Yeah .
6278	0	a	I mean you bu well som
6279	0	a	you get com
6280	0	a	you get combined TV and videos
6281	0	a	do not you ?
6282	0	a	If yeah
6283	0	a	and if you got if you got a Sky box , they have one of those plus boxes , you can record straight off the TV anyway so on to on to like the TV hard drive or so .
6284	0	a	I think we assume that it is still got play and stop functions and programming .
6285	0	a	Yes .
6286	0	a	Yeah .
6287	0	a	Anything about that on the market research or something like regarding whether people want a combined something like that ?
6288	0	a	Ten perc
6289	0	a	we did not really look into that but remember we found that finding that most people only use about ten percent of the buttons , I think th th those do tend to be the basic channel hopping things and on and off for the video , fast forwarding , so on
6290	0	a	and I think it is sort of general knowledge that people do find programming their videos a nightmare
6291	0	a	Yeah .
6292	0	a	Okay .
6293	0	a	Ju just as an idea on the speech recognition thing that pr it would probably be quite expensive to incorporate an entire speech recognition thing
6294	0	a	and they are not that great anyway .
6295	0	a	Pens
6296	0	a	In fact I have just called up that table there , we asked those two questions , the table relates to both questions , so we did not differentiate .
6297	0	a	Alright , okay .
6298	0	a	Would you prefer an LCD screen , that is multi function remote and would you pay more for speech recognition in a remote control ?
6299	0	a	So you can see how the the yes no sort of varies across the age group there , and a substantial number of do not knows in the older age group
6300	0	a	, I think that is just general fear of new technology .
6301	0	a	Alright , okay .
6302	0	a	Yeah .
6303	0	a	Yeah ,
6304	0	a	bu
6305	0	a	We do have a budget limitation that we ca not control ourselves ,
6306	1	a	so I think when we can take a cheaper option which still does the same kind of thing
6307	0	a	because it is something I it needs to be the thing that you use to find it needs to be something that you do not lose , you were saying whistling ,
6308	1	a	maybe on the TV you could put like a pack on the TV or something so you ca not see the remote , you go and press the button on top of the TV
6309	1	a	and it beeps
6310	1	a	and you are like
6311	1	a	oh okay
6312	1	a	it is over there , something like that ,
6313	0	a	but that is that sounds a lot cheaper to me .
6314	0	a	Yeah but on on that again I just thought cause you can get those key chains now and you whistle
6315	0	a	and then it will let off a loud noise to let you know where it is
6316	1	a	so I thought that could be quite a
6317	0	a	Yeah .
6318	0	a	Oh yeah .
6319	0	a	Right .
6320	0	a	Yeah .
6321	0	a	Yes .
6322	0	a	Yeah .
6323	0	a	Okay .
6324	0	a	That is a super idea .
6325	0	a	Yeah .
6326	0	a	Yeah .
6327	0	a	the third thing was that we have to make sure the corporate image is very much incorporated into the handset .
6328	0	a	so we want logo , we want fashionable , trendy ,
6329	0	a	I mean what you were talking about with the marketing .
6330	0	a	, people paying more for it to look good .
6331	0	a	, we need to focus on that as well .
6332	0	a	Yes ,
6333	0	a	further market research will be needed to kind of focus on what that is , it is going to be different for a fifteen year old th for somebody who is sixty and also across the world if we are aiming at the international market .
6334	0	a	Yeah .
6335	0	a	What is attractive to a trendy New Yorker and what is attractive to a retired South African , I dunno , you get the idea .
6336	0	a	It is it is going to vary around the world .
6337	0	a	At the end of the day , th the engineering design is one thing , it is the user interface design that may and th the sort of you know fashionable aspect of it we might have to change for different markets round the world .
6338	0	a	Yeah .
6339	0	a	Yeah .
6340	1	a	So are we talking of a single model or maybe five , six designs ?
6341	0	a	Sure .
6342	0	a	Well y
6343	0	a	yeah
6344	0	a	you could you could have a number of different designs
6345	0	a	I mean inside they would be essentially exactly the same .
6346	0	a	Alright .
6347	0	a	Right .
6348	0	a	Just
6349	0	a	yeah ,
6350	0	a	yeah .
6351	1	a	The features could be same and the body could look slightly different .
6352	0	a	Yeah .
6353	0	a	So
6354	0	a	Yeah .
6355	0	a	What about
6356	0	a	you were talking about the buttons , the controls that are coming out now have kind of big , rubber buttons , not tiny little one , big , rubber buttons ,
6357	1	a	but what about
6358	1	a	, I mean , cause we got to make it original ,
6359	1	a	what about you know with the touch screen computers
6360	0	a	yeah ?
6361	0	a	so you it is like a little panel that you touch rather than a button which should not wear out as much either ,
6362	0	a	not sure about the
6363	0	a	You do not have to press it , you just have to put your thumb onto it .
6364	0	a	Kay .
6365	0	a	Yeah ,
6366	0	a	yeah
6367	0	a	that is what I was just
6368	0	a	yeah .
6369	0	a	No , well no
6370	0	a	cause you would not have to you do not actually have to press them you just
6371	0	a	Yeah .
6372	0	a	, think that might appeal I am thinking kind of Japan , I am thinking young , office people , trendy kind of a thing .
6373	0	a	Yeah .
6374	0	a	Yes it will appeal to sections of the market def
6375	0	a	, but quite , , easily labelled so that anyone can
6376	0	a	oh yeah
6377	0	a	that is obvious what that is for
6378	0	a	and it is not daunting to maybe the older generations , Were too big .
6379	0	a	But also er ergonomics as we are saying with the different designs , ergonomics there is sort of physically different things cause if you have ever seen the X Box they had to make two different sized controllers because people in Japan would not buy it because the controller was physically to big because they are c
6380	0	a	just generally Japanese people have smaller hands so they could not get round the controller
6381	0	a	which is so if you I do not know what cause you
6382	1	a	obviously you can have bigger buttons for some countries or something and smaller ones for others .
6383	1	a	Yeah , maybe to as it it was indicated that risk of repeated use , the injuries , maybe a touch screen could be a better option for that .
6384	0	a	Yeah .
6385	0	a	Yeah .
6386	0	a	So , a bigger b
6387	0	a	okay so y you are dividing designs based on not only segment age groups , you are desi dividing it according to the countries also , the market .
6388	1	a	Maybe for US and all you can have a slightly bigger remote control and maybe in Japan and all you need to have a small , yeah .
6389	0	a	Yeah .
6390	0	a	I think we have to design one product and then the company can take it wherever they want to in the sense that they can make it smaller , or they can make it bigger or they can change the features slightly , .
6391	0	a	Huh .
6392	0	a	Yeah .
6393	0	a	Yeah .
6394	0	a	Th the internal d engineering design has got to remain the same , yes , absolutely .
6395	0	a	It is going to be the same , so we need to focus on just one thing , not get bogged down in lots of different possibilities , .
6396	0	a	Yeah .
6397	0	a	I am concerned ,
6398	0	a	when you read the the RSI issue again , repetitive strain injury , I do not think just moving your finger around on a small screen is going to deal with that enough , I think that is still a kind of a question mark issue how we deal with that .
6399	0	a	, RSI tends to be caused by repetitive small movements .
6400	0	a	Yeah .
6401	0	a	I am j I really ca not get my head round this one ,
6402	1	a	this may have to be postponed to a future meeting but it is something we should think about .
6403	0	a	Yeah .
6404	0	a	I
6405	0	a	yeah
6406	0	a	I was just thinking about how you could combat that cause without without doing something where you have to move your arm around to change the channel
6407	0	a	and it becomes
6408	0	a	yeah .
6409	0	a	I know , and it becomes ridiculous , yes I know .
6410	1	a	Or a speech recognition ,
6411	0	a	which is extremely expensive ,
6412	1	a	I think that is the only way that you kind of avoid that kind of issue .
6413	0	a	Yeah , speech recognition ,
6414	0	a	but
6415	0	a	yeah .
6416	0	a	Yeah .
6417	0	a	Yes .
6418	1	a	Do we have to initially , you know looking at the findings here , focus on a younger age group initially and then broaden out the market later .
6419	0	a	Do we really have to go for everyone right away ? .
6420	1	a	We could focus on the biggest market .
6421	0	a	Ge
6422	0	a	Yeah .
6423	1	a	If say people between age group of twenty to thirty five are the biggest market ?
6424	0	a	And when we have been throwing up our ideas we are automatically talking about business people , young people , trendy people .
6425	0	a	We are
6426	0	a	we are talking about the type of company that we are working for as well .
6427	0	a	That they want it to be fashionable , they want it to be trendy and you would not automatically assume associate that with the older generations .
6428	0	a	Now with the baby boomers , the older generations are actually larger , they have a greater population than us young people , but I do not think we are focusing on that
6429	0	a	, I think we are focusing on a sort of mid range , business kind of class type people .
6430	0	a	I am just thinking of budgetary issues too , for when it does get to the sort of broad scale marketing stage , we want to , you know , not waste money , not be profligate
6431	0	a	and you know focus on where the idea will be taken up
6432	0	a	, first it is most likely to be taken up first of all where the main purchasing power is coming from for a product like this .
6433	0	a	Okay , so the remote control functions .
6434	0	a	we have got the TV , we have got the video ,
6435	0	a	now there is I ca not remember what it is called , the little code at the end of programme details ,
6436	0	a	yes .
6437	0	a	Video plus .
6438	1	a	We could use that as an alternative to programming in times , things like that ,
6439	0	a	is that
6440	0	a	I always found that really easy when I discovered it , because you have got your general record anyway
6441	0	a	so if you there is a programme on you want to put record on , that is fine , but if you do want to tape something in two days time and you are not sure if you are going to , you put the number in and
6442	0	a	it is just a number , it is not a date , it is not a time , it is not a channel , it is not when it finishes , it is not anything like that , it is just a number .
6443	0	a	Yeah yeah .
6444	0	a	Just whack in the number .
6445	0	a	And you w
6446	0	a	yeah .
6447	0	a	And you would not you would not need a whole host of extra buttons for that , you just need one cause you have already got all the numbers there anyway ,
6448	0	a	yeah .
6449	0	a	No .
6450	0	a	You have already got the numbers for typing in anyway .
6451	0	a	Right ,
6452	0	a	I have not come across that function
6453	0	a	but it sounds wonderful .
6454	0	a	It is
6455	0	a	after
6456	0	a	if you look in the newspaper , TV guide or any TV guide there is a five , six digit number afterwards and that is the number you put in and it is recorded that it is going to be on on Tuesdays at ten o'clock on the seventeenth
6457	0	a	so you do not have to worry about dates and you do not have to worry about times , and it has been around for quite a long time .
6458	0	a	It is not
6459	0	a	Yeah .
6460	0	a	Right .
6461	0	a	It is been been around for a long time it is just it is not very well advertised as to how to use it and things .
6462	0	a	No it is not
6463	0	a	but I think if awareness was kind of brought to the forefront about that
6464	0	a	Superb .
6465	0	a	Yes .
6466	0	a	Though if y if you have got something like Sky anyway you can just click on it you can just press the button on the programme once
6467	0	a	and it will record that programme when it is on and you press it on it twice and it will record the whole series .
6468	0	a	Right .
6469	0	a	Excellent , .
6470	0	a	So that
6471	0	a	yeah .
6472	0	a	But just to have that function would be would be really good .
6473	0	a	Right .
6474	0	a	Okay so
6475	1	a	Can I just run this past you while it occurs to me ,
6476	0	a	I do not mean to quickly jump from one subject to another , but just discussing the different age groups and targeting the different age groups it occurs to me , to produce our own mobile phones , that that is kind of what led us on to comparing TV remote controls with with their design features , , chain companies like Carphone Warehouse , you can pop in anytime with a phone that you bought for them
6477	0	a	w if you have got any problems with it and they will fix it , they will phone the company , you can use their telephones .
6478	0	a	Yeah .
6479	1	a	Is it worthwhile with with our retail outlets having a a similar kind of service so that if older users were deterred from buying this , if they know they can just pop into one of our high street outlets , th you know , which button is it I press for this ?
6480	1	a	Th as free as a free aspect of our service , would that not make it more attractive to them ?
6481	0	a	But the only problem is that with a mobile phone you signed for a contract so they
6482	0	a	the companies who who you deal with have actually
6483	0	a	they have they have got an obligation to to help you out
6484	0	a	and also I mean it is it is fair enough to have some sort of help service
6485	0	a	but
6486	0	a	I
6487	0	a	I am not sure how much the cost would be of having
6488	0	a	Yeah ,
6489	0	a	I mean
6490	0	a	I mean instru instruction books
6491	0	a	I feel c
6492	0	a	I reckon can cover that .
6493	0	a	Right .
6494	0	a	The functionality of it in the sense that you are sitting there , you are pressing this button and your TV is not doing it .
6495	0	a	Alright .
6496	0	a	Taking your TV and your control and saying look this is what I am doing , it is not working , what should I do ?
6497	0	a	I think so .
6498	0	a	Yes
6499	1	a	If it was something as simple as you could not change the channel ,
6500	0	a	but I mean for if there were any more
6501	0	a	or are we absolutely definite it is only going to be for TV and video , we are not going to put any
6502	0	a	okay , just a thought .
6503	0	a	Instruction manuals .
6504	0	a	Okay .
6505	0	a	But I mean they are there is customer service , there will be a customer service number thing that you can phone up and speak to and that way there is no call out charge , there is no extra , t the person has to walk to a shop on the high street , .
6506	0	a	Yeah .
6507	0	a	Department , yeah .
6508	0	a	Sure .
6509	0	a	Right .
6510	0	a	Yeah .
6511	0	a	I think it will be too much of an effort for a person to
6512	0	a	for a phone maybe he might walk down the street , but for a remote he will just refer to the manual and all that .
6513	0	a	Yeah .
6514	0	a	Not for such simple functions because we are focusing on that ,
6515	0	a	yes okay .
6516	0	a	And they are
6517	0	a	yeah , they should be f
6518	0	a	yeah .
6519	0	a	But we should focus on making the manual as user friendly as possible because a lot of them are just tiny little writing and lots and lots of pages .
6520	0	a	Simple .
6521	0	a	Yeah .
6522	0	a	Yeah .
6523	0	a	Puts people off reading them so they just do the obvious , yes .
6524	0	a	It is the
6525	0	a	yeah .
6526	0	a	It does ,
6527	0	a	you just put it in the drawer until something goes wrong and then you try and search through it , so that should be something we think about .
6528	0	a	Sure , okay .
6529	0	a	, what other functions ?
6530	0	a	We need
6531	0	a	I am not sure if we need a design decision now ,
6532	0	a	but we should think about c cause you have got the dilemma between
6533	0	a	oh batteries , that is what I was thinking about .
6534	0	a	Mobile phone batteries , what kind of battery is that ?
6535	0	a	Well they la they
6536	0	a	they last quite a long time ,
6537	0	a	and if you had when you
6538	0	a	th the thing that you get with mobile house phones , you sit it in its charger when you are not using it or t at night or something , but it does not really matter cause it never really runs out cause it lasts a long time once it is charged .
6539	0	a	they are they are specially made for the for the mobile phones , but they come with a charger ,
6540	1	a	I mean you could you could bundle a charger in with it but
6541	0	a	Yeah .
6542	0	a	Yeah .
6543	0	a	Yeah .
6544	0	a	, something like that should reduce the size of it .
6545	0	a	Yeah
6546	0	a	and if
6547	1	a	yeah
6548	1	a	if you if you had if you had one of those just coming back to your other point about pressing the button and setting off the bleeper in the room that could
6549	0	a	Yeah on that as well so .
6550	0	a	Yeah
6551	1	a	it could be on that
6552	0	a	yeah ,
6553	0	a	okay .
6554	0	a	S
6555	0	a	Yes .
6556	0	a	So are we talking of a concept of a rechargeable something on the remote ?
6557	0	a	Yeah some sort of docking station or
6558	0	a	yeah .
6559	0	a	Rechargeable with a docking station .
6560	0	a	So the rechargeable which would be your field .
6561	0	a	Yeah yeah th
6562	0	a	yeah
6563	0	a	that that would be fine ,
6564	0	a	and also that would mean they would not have to go out buying batteries all the time .
6565	0	a	Okay .
6566	0	a	Yes ,
6567	0	a	which it is cheaper in the long run as well .
6568	0	a	Right .
6569	0	a	Yeah .
6570	0	a	, th the shape you got trendy .
6571	0	a	I do not want to big box with lots of things , you do not want a tiny sort of little thing either , because then you have got the repetitive strain injury no matter how many how much you try and make it simple ,
6572	0	a	They do .
6573	0	a	And we do not w
6574	0	a	I mean so many remote controls look absolutely identical , these long , brown things with the same coloured buttons all crammed in on the s the surface .
6575	0	a	Yeah .
6576	0	a	We definitely
6577	0	a	an ob an obvious thing , a very simple thing is to get away from these brown rectangles , we do not want that .
6578	0	a	Okay so we have got a flip screen .
6579	0	a	Okay .
6580	0	a	Okay .
6581	0	a	What I was thinking of a design which Nokia h came up with almost six or seven years back .
6582	0	a	Basically we have a flat one
6583	0	a	it
6584	0	a	it looks like a box , like a chocolate .
6585	0	a	Yeah .
6586	0	a	That is very strenuous
6587	0	a	because your thumb is slightly up , so they came up with something like this , curled up , so here , and you do not have to you do not bend your thumb too much , so it is like you can say a banana shape kind of thing , curled up like a boat .
6588	0	a	Slightly curved , curved .
6589	0	a	Yeah .
6590	0	a	G so what happens is you do not have to press your thumb too down like .
6591	0	a	So it is already curled up so your thumb does not
6592	0	a	y yeah
6593	0	a	so we can have a s like you know moulded according to your the way you h hold of it is kind of semi circular in the bottom , something like that .
6594	0	a	Cause it is kind of moulded to your hand anyway .
6595	0	a	Yeah .
6596	0	a	Okay .
6597	0	a	I would not say exactly semi circular but yeah smooth .
6598	1	a	Can you look into the company logo ?
6599	0	a	, things that are associated with the company in view to trying to incorporate that into the design of the product .
6600	0	a	Current .
6601	1	a	I mean for example , if it was a C or something like that , you could have it in a vague C shape that opens up kind of like a shell , or something ,
6602	0	a	something along those lines to be able to incorporate it quite obviously into the design , while also making it quite different from anything else that is there .
6603	0	a	We could look in at that
6604	0	a	but .
6605	0	a	I mean look at the mobile .
6606	0	a	What we were talking is to make it more rather than like sea shells ,
6607	0	a	logo could become as
6608	1	a	you could put a logo in the corner of the model , rather than you know , trying to make it like a sea shell or whatever you were ta telling like .
6609	0	a	Well we need to think about how it is going to look different .
6610	0	a	I think that is that sounds a really attractive idea ,
6611	0	a	I have not come across anything like that before ,
6612	0	a	if it kind of
6613	0	a	yeah and that opens out into your flip top .
6614	0	a	A sea shell ?
6615	1	a	Yeah we could look in at that .
6616	0	a	Yeah .
6617	0	a	Then it is nice t to h
6618	1	a	you can make it lightweight plastic ,
6619	0	a	nice to hold in the palm of the hand
6620	0	a	and just because you are having to actually insert in between the two covers , that is going to take care of some of the repetitive strain injury trying p prevent a lot of that I would think .
6621	0	a	I think it is a really nice idea
6622	0	a	and plus you can get
6623	0	a	you know even though we are using plastic , you can still I mean think of the designs you can get in plastic ,
6624	1	a	we can do a nice conch shell or scallop shell exterior .
6625	1	a	Or you could do different , like you get with mobile phones , different fascias .
6626	1	a	You could have different kind of casings .
6627	0	a	Yeah .
6628	1	a	So you could have like psychedelic ones for younger people and sleek ones and
6629	0	a	Yeah .
6630	0	a	Less chance of it being lost too , it is not like a chocolate brown lozenge that is going to go down the sofa
6631	1	a	and people might want to put it on their mantelpiece or whatever as a ki if it looks attractive enough as a kind of ornament
6632	0	a	they do not not going to lose it so much either .
6633	0	a	It is easier to bit nice to handle .
6634	1	a	Yeah maybe we could come at some say five , six des designs and then choose which are whichever appeals the most like , that could be the most common design .
6635	0	a	Okay .
6636	0	a	Yeah .
6637	0	a	Okay .
6638	0	a	Okay .
6639	0	a	Okay .
6640	1	a	But we can like think of five , six designs .
6641	0	a	Right , I think we have to round it up ,
6642	0	a	Sure .
6643	1	a	Can I just quickly go over the new project requirements so that I have not missed anything .
6644	0	a	So it is no teletext , it is only for TV and by implication video , our corporate image should be incorporated in the remote control ,
6645	0	a	something about Videoplus .
6646	0	a	That was in cutting down the number that was kind of separate that was cutting down the number of functions , making it simpler so instead of having lots of things you put in for date
6647	0	a	It is kind of takes the place of having a button to press for the date and having the button to press for the channel , things like that .
6648	0	a	Right .
6649	0	a	Right .
6650	1	a	Right , so when they press for programming you it comes up on the LCD , a reminder about using Videoplus ?
6651	1	a	So that they have a look at the guide and
6652	0	a	Or was is this nothing to do with the project requirements , is this just that was an add on feature ?
6653	0	a	Uh huh .
6654	0	a	Right .
6655	0	a	Right , so it is kind of doing away with the programming feature ?
6656	0	a	Right .
6657	0	a	it could be it
6658	0	a	c
6659	0	a	It
6660	0	a	yes ,
6661	1	a	it could be adv advertisement feature , rather than design feature , you know , drawing attention to that .
6662	0	a	Yeah .
6663	1	a	And it also paid lip service in the instruction manual ,
6664	0	a	cause it is very simple so putting it down in words should be helpful .
6665	0	a	, and the rechargeable batteries .
6666	0	a	Yeah .
6667	0	a	Was there anything else there that we in the new new project requirements ?
6668	0	a	We have got the buttons but I think we will work through that with the design of it , .
6669	0	a	Yeah .
6670	0	a	Yeah .
6671	0	a	That is not at the moment a requirement , it is something we are looking at , what preference so it may come round to market research at some point to see what people would like .
6672	0	a	Yes .
6673	0	a	Yes .
6674	0	a	And we have talked about there being an alarm or something , a beeping for being lost , .
6675	0	a	For detection , right .
6676	0	a	Yeah .
6677	0	a	Learning how to use it should be as simple as possible .
6678	0	a	But there are not going to be that func that many functions incorporated into it so it should be fine and
6679	0	a	the I the instruction manual
6680	0	a	, I do not know if we deal with that , .
6681	0	a	I think
6682	0	a	Yep ,
6683	0	a	and different from what is out there .
6684	0	a	Yep ,
6685	0	a	I think
6686	0	a	True .
6687	0	a	Okay .
6688	0	a	Yep , I think that is us .
6689	0	a	What would you specifically like marketing to look at before the next meeting ?
6690	0	a	Or shall I just sort of generally look at all the issues involved ?
6691	0	a	Okay .
6692	0	a	I think you might get guidance ,
6693	0	a	but I th
6694	0	a	Instruction manuals , cause there tends to be a demonised thing , u , they are everyone is got like a big pile of them , but no one really uses them .
6695	0	a	Okay .
6696	0	a	Whoops , questionnaire four .
6697	0	a	Oops .
6698	0	a	We should f
6699	0	a	Yes , right .
6700	0	a	Okay .
6701	0	a	Right , okay .
6702	1	a	I think you can email me , if there is any more questions .
6703	0	a	 
6704	1	a	I will wait until you are all hooked up .
6705	0	a	Oh good grief .
6706	0	a	Kay .
6707	0	a	Okay .
6708	0	a	Oh .
6709	1	a	Put it on in that way .
6710	0	a	Oops .
6711	0	a	Thanks .
6712	0	a	Okay .
6713	0	a	Welcome back everybody , hope you have had fun .
6714	0	a	After lunch .
6715	0	a	Yeah .
6716	0	a	Right this is our conceptual design meeting , I think we are slightly ahead of ourselves from the last meeting ,
6717	0	a	I th
6718	0	a	I
6719	0	a	I think
6720	0	a	yeah .
6721	0	a	Yeah ,
6722	0	a	yeah
6723	0	a	I was getting that impression as well .
6724	0	a	This is where we talk about properties , materials , user interface and trend watching .
6725	0	a	Etcetera .
6726	0	a	So I think we have touched on a few things to do with that already ,
6727	1	a	but we will just go over it .
6728	0	a	the minutes from the last time .
6729	0	a	we had a couple of changes in our plans in that we could not use teletext , it was not going to be a control for everything and that we had to incorporate the image of the company into it somehow .
6730	0	a	we have decided on a leaving out the voice recognition , we have decided on there being a flip design and a different shape from what is normal .
6731	0	a	We were thinking a shell , but something along those lines , just a different shape from what is normal , .
6732	0	a	You were going to look into the rechargeable batteries and we were going to think about the port and an alarm for getting it lost , things like that , and our market was going to be young , business , kind of range .
6733	0	a	Yeah .
6734	0	a	Yeah .
6735	0	a	Kay .
6736	1	a	Okay , so shall we start with the first presentation ?
6737	0	a	Yes if you feel It is okay .
6738	1	a	Shall I ?
6739	0	a	Okay .
6740	0	a	Yep .
6741	1	a	We just connect up .
6742	0	a	Thank you .
6743	0	a	There we go .
6744	0	a	Okay
6745	0	a	so we decided on our market and so this feedback from the marketing department is really about trend watching .
6746	0	a	the methods we used to decide on current trends and so on , market trends , were that we did our traditional our usual market research study with a hundred subjects
6747	0	a	and the the general feedback from them is that the most
6748	0	a	im w
6749	0	a	I am sorry
6750	0	a	I am slightly tongue tied after lunch ,
6751	0	a	sorry Project Manager .
6752	0	a	we decided on the most important aspect i required in a remote control device and we will come to that later .
6753	0	a	So that was one of the first things we did .
6754	0	a	Also with our company being forerunners in putting fashion into technology , we also looked at a fashion update using our consultants on fashion and design in Paris and Milan .
6755	0	a	so the general findings from that was in the market trends the most important aspect for remote controls were people want a fancy look and feel , rather than the the current functional look and feel of remote controls .
6756	0	a	They also also want a remote control to be technologically innovative , and of course , as we predicted , that it should be easy to use .
6757	0	a	Now I should point out that the first of those findings , fancy look and feel , is the most important , is twice as important as the second , technologically innovative , which is in turn twice as important as being easy to use .
6758	0	a	So possibly that the feature that we put first is actually third is still important , but it is third in order of preference for the the subject group we looked at .
6759	0	a	Yeah .
6760	0	a	Okay , ,
6761	0	a	now the fashion update which relates to very personal preferences among our subject group , we found from our consultants in Paris and Milan who des attended all the design and fashion fairs there , that fruit and vegetables are going to be the theme for clothes , shoes and furniture .
6762	1	a	So should we be thinking of using something like that in our remote control design too ?
6763	0	a	There also seems to be a trend towards a spongy feel to materials , again in contrast to last year .
6764	0	a	So a lot of interesting feedback there , both from our market research departments and from our people in Paris and Milan .
6765	0	a	Be interesting to see what our design people make of that .
6766	0	a	Kay .
6767	0	a	Okay thank you very much .
6768	1	a	let is start from the inside and work our way out .
6769	0	a	Yep .
6770	0	a	Fine .
6771	0	a	Yeah , okay .
6772	0	a	It is okay with me .
6773	0	a	Unless anyone has any questions about that ?
6774	0	a	Not yet ?
6775	0	a	Kay .
6776	0	a	I do not think so , not yet .
6777	0	a	, yes , thank you .
6778	0	a	That screwed in ?
6779	0	a	Yeah .
6780	0	a	Okay .
6781	0	a	I hate those little things
6782	0	a	especially if you do them on too tight and you ca not get the leverage on them to undo them .
6783	0	a	I know .
6784	0	a	Kay ,
6785	0	a	Okay .
6786	0	a	Okay .
6787	0	a	this is all about the design of the actual components and the availability of the components we have in stock at the moment .
6788	0	a	Okay , first the Into the method .
6789	0	a	The the main idea of the whole thing is just
6790	0	a	so you
6791	0	a	sh you just press buttons and it should activate things on the TV and we discussed last meeting that it should be easy to find .
6792	0	a	also in this study I have looked into the availability of some of the materials , cause some of the things that we looked at last time are not un unfortunately are not available .
6793	0	a	Kay .
6794	0	a	, findings , I have got my nice little picture there .
6795	0	a	This is the chip called the TA double one eight three five which is what is used in pretty much every remote control cause it sends out standard signals , based on your input and it is pretty much used for all all TV remotes at the moment .
6796	0	a	Kay .
6797	0	a	and then we we are loo looking into battery options .
6798	0	a	There is actually no rechargeable option available ,
6799	0	a	so we
6800	0	a	I saw the the standard double A and triple A
6801	0	a	which we thought were a bit bit too bulky at the moment ,
6802	0	a	dynamo charging ,
6803	0	a	I thought that that might be a bit silly to be to be honest ,
6804	0	a	people wo not
6805	0	a	it is it is basically like wind up radio .
6806	0	a	Wa
6807	0	a	can you explain that ?
6808	0	a	Like a
6809	0	a	right
6810	0	a	, okay .
6811	0	a	So you wind up your remote control before you use it .
6812	0	a	How what kind of
6813	0	a	how l long can you get out of that , I mean can you pick it up and then wind it for two minutes and then that is it for the night ?
6814	0	a	Or That does not count though does it ?
6815	0	a	I thought it was UV like
6816	0	a	Any , any
6817	0	a	I am pretty sure that solar is from the sun .
6818	0	a	It might You
6819	0	a	Yeah ,
6820	0	a	yeah ,
6821	0	a	oh yeah
6822	0	a	I presu you would not have to wind it for very long ,
6823	0	a	but I do not I do not think it is really sort of necessary when you th you think of the next two options ,
6824	0	a	like the the solar charging , cause most people have the light on in the room anyway
6825	0	a	so they could get when when you got TV .
6826	0	a	Does does light charge as as sunlight does ?
6827	0	a	Artificial light ?
6828	0	a	Has to be solar .
6829	0	a	No .
6830	0	a	Is it ?
6831	0	a	Alright i
6832	0	a	Yeah it would the d
6833	0	a	yeah
6834	0	a	the dynamo would take more space
6835	0	a	cause you actually need a physical sort of handle to wind up .
6836	1	a	Yep .
6837	0	a	Regarding those sizes , which one you think will be light
6838	0	a	because we we have to take into consideration size also , so maybe a standard triple A might take lesser space or and dynamo might take more space .
6839	0	a	Yeah , okay .
6840	0	a	, I do not think it counts electric lights
6841	0	a	no ,
6842	0	a	but I mean not many you do not want to limit your market .
6843	0	a	Artificial light , no .
6844	0	a	That is going to
6845	0	a	I know ,
6846	0	a	different parts of the world too , if we are if we are marketing internationally .
6847	0	a	I mean people who live in basement flats there is not that many people , but there are people .
6848	0	a	Right .
6849	0	a	But
6850	0	a	Yeah
6851	0	a	and most people most people also watch TV in the in the night anyway .
6852	0	a	Night .
6853	0	a	, but then it would be charging through the day ,
6854	0	a	I think the point is that it charges through the day
6855	0	a	and then you have got it charged for the evening .
6856	0	a	But I I think I think the the next one is the best anyway .
6857	0	a	Okay .
6858	0	a	The the kinetic charging which is like you get it in r
6859	0	a	you get it in wrist watches and you d you do not even notice it .
6860	0	a	Yeah I have seen
6861	0	a	But then if you think about a watch , it is on your wrist so it is on your whole bod
6862	0	a	it is on your body the whole time
6863	0	a	so you are walking around , you are doing things , it is moving a lot of the time
6864	0	a	I mean the amount the amount of probably moving around you would be doing all the time would would charge it up , I do not think you would ever need to actually physically start shaking it up to make it work .
6865	0	a	And are these like
6866	0	a	what are the life of the kinetic battery , it like it runs for long time ?
6867	0	a	yeah
6868	0	a	it is it charges into some form of
6869	0	a	it is a smaller cell which it charges into and the si the size sort of a watch a watch battery , cause they use them quite frequently in watches .
6870	0	a	Okay .
6871	0	a	And that will that would l would last for
6872	0	a	well I do I
6873	0	a	d I am not entirely sure how long it would last
6874	0	a	but I have never seen one run out .
6875	0	a	We c
6876	0	a	Solar would be slightly expensives .
6877	0	a	Yeah .
6878	0	a	Yeah
6879	0	a	and Yeah but then again
6880	0	a	I I think it is
6881	0	a	because if you think about it , the watch , although it is only a tiny amount it is it is it is always moving for the whole day
6882	0	a	and they do not run out over night when you leave them on the side .
6883	0	a	If you would
6884	0	a	I mean you switch the TV on
6885	0	a	, then you put it on the side , then you pick it up to change it
6886	0	a	and then you put it on the side .
6887	0	a	Is it really going to be enough ?
6888	0	a	Okay .
6889	0	a	And th for the same the same reason , you are only using it for a v incredibly short amount of time just to send the signal and then you are finished with it
6890	0	a	and you put it
6891	0	a	no no
6892	0	a	I do
6893	0	a	I do not think the the draw on it would be
6894	0	a	So it is not the draw on it is not
6895	0	a	Okay .
6896	1	a	Could I just ask
6897	0	a	referring back to solar charging , is that compatible with standard batteries ?
6898	0	a	I mean , could people put standard batteries in but with a s you know they could leave it in the sunlight for solar charging or the two things not compatible ?
6899	0	a	yeah
6900	0	a	I think I th
6901	0	a	g y
6902	0	a	you could have a dual power thing but the the thing with the solar cells is you would need to put them on the case
6903	0	a	and they because , if you lie
6904	0	a	on a calculator they they are qui they are quite big and they all they all look i identical .
6905	0	a	Like a dual kind of .
6906	0	a	So that affects the exterior design .
6907	0	a	Expensive as well .
6908	0	a	They are they are expensive ,
6909	0	a	they do not
6910	0	a	Yeah the normal batteries would be the cheapest
6911	0	a	I would presume then it would actually be the the solar charging ones ,
6912	0	a	but the
6913	0	a	It is i I think they are not very resistant to dropping , cause if you drop stuff yeah
6914	0	a	if you if you have y
6915	0	a	the size you would need to charge a remote would not be that big
6916	0	a	but I mean if remotes always get thrown around and stuff , so .
6917	0	a	What kind of price are we looking at for
6918	0	a	I presume the normal batteries are the cheapest ?
6919	0	a	Solar .
6920	0	a	It is twelve point
6921	0	a	f
6922	0	a	Another question is like
6923	0	a	sorry .
6924	0	a	Well they are not designed Practical wise okay .
6925	0	a	Y I think
6926	0	a	yeah , practically .
6927	0	a	I mean calculators you do not really throw around a lot whereas remotes you do ,
6928	0	a	they can t
6929	0	a	Yeah they do ,
6930	0	a	they
6931	0	a	yeah they have got dual things , but they are the batteries are smaller
6932	0	a	I think .
6933	0	a	You do get a bit of wear
6934	0	a	but do not calculators have a battery in them as well ?
6935	0	a	Again it de
6936	0	a	W w which one would last the longest ,
6937	0	a	because we do not want customers to be like you know charging like a mobile phone every day .
6938	0	a	A remote control , like ,
6939	1	a	so we have to s look at the life also .
6940	0	a	W m
6941	0	a	yeah
6942	0	a	so the
6943	0	a	Yeah
6944	0	a	the the s if you
6945	0	a	if you had something du using the standard batteries and the solar charging ,
6946	0	a	, I do not think you would I think the
6947	0	a	it would d well you know how long the standard double As would last in or triple As would last .
6948	0	a	It would just detract from the attractiveness of the of the whole feature , i it is not going to add anything , okay .
6949	0	a	Yeah I think i I think it would ,
6950	0	a	yeah .
6951	1	a	Okay , can we add in an attachment to closing feature ?
6952	1	a	Can we think about that ?
6953	0	a	Cause if we are doing the kinetic thing
6954	0	a	and it is
6955	1	a	Well add it in to think about
6956	0	a	because ,
6957	0	a	where am I ?
6958	0	a	If it is the kinetic thing and it is small and it is portable and it is a different shape and the kinetic is something people do not do kind of we are doing something original and different but if you wore it if it is something you could just clip on your pocket then you would have that less , you you would not lose it so much .
6959	0	a	Okay .
6960	0	a	Yeah .
6961	1	a	Should not we do some market research on that first before we add it in
6962	0	a	because I I personally
6963	0	a	right
6964	0	a	, okay .
6965	0	a	Yeah .
6966	0	a	Yeah .
6967	0	a	But then maybe that is looking at someone who is just sitting on their own rather than the eternal battle for control of the controls .
6968	0	a	Yeah .
6969	0	a	It is not something that is come up in any of our focus groups and market research , it is not a thing that people are looking for when we threw it open to the field
6970	0	a	yeah .
6971	0	a	No .
6972	0	a	Okay .
6973	0	a	So
6974	0	a	Okay .
6975	1	a	But it is something to put on the side to think about maybe .
6976	0	a	Okay , right .
6977	0	a	Okay ,
6978	1	a	well I will move on .
6979	0	a	, my second part of my findings
6980	0	a	the mo
6981	0	a	most current remotes use this silicone PCB board which pr printed circuit board , which basically has these contacts that are really close together and then when you press down on the rubber button , it will connect the circuit and each each switch is connected to two different legs on the chip and so sends a different message and that then gets translated by the chip into a code and then it is fired out of this LED in the sequence of l on and off bursts .
6982	0	a	What kind of things do we have to consider there ?
6983	0	a	Can we what kind of size ,
6984	0	a	does it come in varying sizes or is it just one size
6985	0	a	and we would have to fit the design of
6986	0	a	Well well this the thi
6987	0	a	the thing about is they they can be as big or as small as you want them to be because you can you can print circuit board like that
6988	0	a	that it is it is simply spaced like that so you can have fit the n the size of the nine buttons in .
6989	0	a	If you if you see how thin the tracks are , you could you could s you could put them virtually right next to each other and have a much smaller switch on each one , if you if you wanted to
6990	0	a	but the
6991	0	a	there is an option to do to do it like that , or you could have some sort of array of switches
6992	1	a	which I will speak about in the next bit
6993	0	a	so that
6994	0	a	And then to
6995	0	a	yeah ,
6996	0	a	so to conserve battery life the remote should be in a standby mode no while not being used .
6997	0	a	Okay .
6998	0	a	Okay .
6999	0	a	Now what I was thinking about that was cause sometimes when y when you have these things , they have got little lights on behind the buttons , so you can see what all the buttons are , like on a mobile phone , they do it more often than on a than on a TV remote ,
7000	1	a	but you could you could have lights behind the buttons and after like five or ten seconds of not being used I would have that turned off ,
7001	0	a	if we decided to go for buttons that could light up .
7002	0	a	Okay .
7003	0	a	, the case material , I have a been sent what the factory can actually give us ,
7004	0	a	the
7005	0	a	there is the plastic which I think we were going to go for anyway as the main case case housing
7006	0	a	and
7007	0	a	the the main problems with the well you could go for wood
7008	0	a	but I think it would be a bit impractical .
7009	0	a	Titanium very expensive just to process , which to make it is expensive , and rubber , well you are saying that people like this spongy feel this year ,
7010	1	a	so perhaps some something made of rubber , but I was thinking more of the buttons ,
7011	0	a	because the buttons which they have they have said that they have they have put across are what is used in some stress ball manufacture and it is meant to be anti RSI .
7012	0	a	Okay .
7013	0	a	I am no I am not sure how that would work because surely your fingers would still be moving over the short distances
7014	0	a	but that is what they said .
7015	0	a	the problem with the casing is that there is quite there is quite a few design restrictions that they have got on the shape of the case .
7016	0	a	If you go for titanium they can only do a standard box shape , whereas if you come to plastic they can they can be a little more they can they can do sort of curved shapes .
7017	0	a	But whether whether or not
7018	0	a	because we would have it in two separate units for the flip phone .
7019	0	a	Second thing is
7020	0	a	yeah and second question is like , a mobile you can change the cover , you call it a skin or whatever .
7021	0	a	Hinged , yeah .
7022	0	a	Yeah .
7023	0	a	So in this case if you are looking at like a customer can change the colour like from green , parrot green to chilli red or something like that .
7024	0	a	Yeah I th
7025	0	a	So is that feature available in like titanium , or it is like only specific to plastic or
7026	0	a	Yeah in in titanium
7027	0	a	I do not
7028	0	a	I do not think it would be available at all really ,
7029	0	a	the ju just
7030	0	a	it
7031	0	a	w well you could make it available in the titanium
7032	0	a	, it was just it would be so expensive to buy a new case for it , because of the expense of how much titanium is is it is light and strong
7033	0	a	but I think it should be left for aircraft design rather than for
7034	0	a	for a remote .
7035	0	a	It does mark quite easily too if you let it fall .
7036	0	a	I have got a mobile phone myself which is titanium
7037	0	a	and it does mark very easily if you drop it .
7038	0	a	Yeah ,
7039	0	a	yeah .
7040	1	a	I was just wondering if we make the basic mould out of plastic but have like a rubber cover that goes over ,
7041	0	a	that would give the spongy feel , that also allows us to kind of have different fasciae for the phone .
7042	0	a	Rubber , yeah .
7043	0	a	And you can peel them off yeah .
7044	0	a	So instead of the fascia that comes off being plastic , the fascia that comes off would be the rubber , like those pens that you get with the grip , that you can you can pull that off .
7045	0	a	Yeah .
7046	0	a	Like a rubber sleeve almost , yeah .
7047	0	a	Yeah .
7048	0	a	Something like
7049	0	a	Alright .
7050	0	a	Yeah .
7051	0	a	That could be a good idea .
7052	0	a	It could
7053	0	a	it would be comfortable to hold on also .
7054	0	a	Okay .
7055	0	a	Very cheap way of changing the look of it and people can just buy a new one if they want to .
7056	0	a	T
7057	0	a	Yeah .
7058	0	a	Well that is been really popular with mobile phones
7059	0	a	so I do not see why not .
7060	0	a	Yeah .
7061	0	a	Also the
7062	0	a	just just going back to the interface designs with the buttons ,
7063	0	a	the
7064	0	a	I kno we were planning to do some sort of touch screen .
7065	0	a	Kay .
7066	0	a	Now what I was saying before about instead of having
7067	0	a	you could have just a bare PCB circuit board and I am sure you could probably get it in different colours and so just by touching it with your finger it would make the connection over if you had them close enough , that would be one option .
7068	0	a	the second option th they offer rubber buttons ,
7069	1	a	but I thought that an LCD type of screen
7070	0	a	cause one they are incredibly thin and do not take up much space , two they you can have them in a sort of array and you can arrange the buttons on the screen in a sort of set thing and you could have them like a touch display .
7071	0	a	Sorry I did not get the last part , you are talking of
7072	0	a	Just what you said I
7073	0	a	I did not get the meaning of it completely , you are saying like
7074	0	a	Uh huh .
7075	0	a	what what
7076	0	a	Oh on the on the LCD screen you could becau you could fit it the problem with it basically is that it is flat and so you ca not do lots of curve curved things with it ,
7077	0	a	but you can you would not have
7078	0	a	with the LCD you would have the wires coming off , you would not have that with the with the LCD
7079	0	a	, you would only have that with the printed circuit board .
7080	0	a	Okay .
7081	0	a	With
7082	0	a	W also with the
7083	0	a	Yeah .
7084	0	a	I do not
7085	0	a	s sorry to interrupt ,
7086	0	a	I do not see why the curved thing is a problem ,
7087	0	a	if we for example had a shell , once we open that
7088	0	a	yeah , so it would be f
7089	0	a	yeah ,
7090	0	a	yeah .
7091	0	a	Oh it would be flat inside .
7092	0	a	You could have a flat screen inside , yeah , but I am just wondering whether we want an LCD screen inside .
7093	0	a	Have I misunderstood you ?
7094	0	a	It would not be like full colour , it would just be black and white , but there would be touch touch buttons , so you would not be pressing down on them , w
7095	0	a	or we could have rubber buttons which are made of this material which is anti RSI .
7096	0	a	Kay .
7097	0	a	I think it would be good to have a contrast between , if the whole thing is going to be this rubber thing it would be good to open it up and see something quite fancy looking inside .
7098	0	a	Is rubber .
7099	0	a	Yeah .
7100	0	a	Now how would you distinguish , if you had it bare , how would you distinguish where you had to press , I mean
7101	0	a	Like one of the palm pop thing .
7102	0	a	Yeah I had not I had not really thought of that to be honest .
7103	0	a	I just had another idea , I do not know if it helps with that , but just to do with the RSI .
7104	0	a	Is it possible , just as an option , when we open it up , people can use their fingers to press the button , or we have inside like a small pointer thing when people want to .
7105	0	a	Yeah you could , you could have some sort of stylus that you could pull out
7106	0	a	but I
7107	0	a	I think they could get a bit easily lost ,
7108	0	a	cause I had
7109	0	a	Yeah .
7110	0	a	Absolutely , f for somebody who very often , if he would a person who switches channels very often or does use a particular function very often will find it very irritating to use a and he might spoil the touch pad very fast compared to a button like , if you keep punching with an pointer or whatever .
7111	0	a	They are easy to replace as well , cheap .
7112	0	a	It would have to be attached .
7113	0	a	Yeah .
7114	0	a	Yeah .
7115	0	a	Yeah .
7116	0	a	Yeah okay .
7117	0	a	Yeah just a thought
7118	0	a	they would not actually need one and they could use anything they have got ,
7119	0	a	could not they ?
7120	0	a	A pencil or a pen , so they would not really need a
7121	1	a	Okay , we will talk about that so if you finish your and we will come back to that .
7122	0	a	Yeah that is
7123	0	a	yeah
7124	0	a	that that is the end of m
7125	0	a	my
7126	0	a	Yeah .
7127	0	a	That is you , right okay .
7128	1	a	And just one small question before like you are ,
7129	1	a	regarding the circuit , since we are hav having a flip top , we can customise the two circuits for different type of buttons like we are keeping the standard buttons on the top and the more complex buttons under this thing , so we can divide the circuit like you know .
7130	0	a	yeah .
7131	0	a	Yeah yeah that that would be fairly simple ,
7132	0	a	I mean you would you would actually have two separate you would have two separate circuit boards
7133	0	a	but they would be joined by wires or like some cabling between them , cause in the in the actual flip bit you would have some linking .
7134	0	a	Okay .
7135	0	a	Okay .
7136	1	a	I will just raise another point while it occurs to me ,
7137	0	a	it kind of applies to both our designers here , so I am not sure how it would fit in .
7138	0	a	If we flip open , now you know how you have got some mirrors in nightclubs that are mirrors when you turn to them
7139	0	a	and you turn away
7140	0	a	and it gives like an advertising display ,
7141	0	a	you seen those ?
7142	0	a	And they kind of respond to the turn of your body .
7143	0	a	No .
7144	0	a	Is it possible that when we open our flip top shell it is a little compact mirror and when you press a button it then goes onto the phone display th the remote control display thing .
7145	0	a	We are marketing to guys as much as we are to women .
7146	0	a	They do not look at themselves ?
7147	0	a	Just a thought .
7148	0	a	Well it is a remote control , you were sitting watching TV
7149	0	a	are you going to want to sort of open it and
7150	0	a	say oh shit I should go and have a shower and do my hair before I put the T
7151	0	a	Yeah , no , no .
7152	0	a	Yeah .
7153	0	a	I know what you mean ,
7154	0	a	it is with us using the ideas for a mobile ph
7155	0	a	it is with us using the ideas for mobile phones I kind of got sidetracked onto that
7156	0	a	I think , okay .
7157	0	a	trying to think of other features we can build in that would not cost too much
7158	1	a	but maybe we will leave that one on the side .
7159	0	a	Yeah .
7160	0	a	Kay .
7161	0	a	Okay .
7162	0	a	I mean you can you could do it ,
7163	0	a	you could have a
7164	0	a	cause if you if you just put the full charge through an LCD display it will completely blank it out , but I do not know if you could get any mirror effect on it , I am not sure about
7165	0	a	Yeah .
7166	0	a	Oh I think forget about the mirror
7167	0	a	that was just a very quick passing thought
7168	0	a	yeah .
7169	0	a	Okay , okay .
7170	0	a	Okay ,
7171	1	a	would like to share something which I did here .
7172	0	a	First thing is basically on design we just took the input from the previous meeting , especially from the marketing and industrial design , to check on the customer needs and feasibility .
7173	0	a	Second is we checked into competitors , the picture here shows one of the standard models offered by competitors here .
7174	0	a	So y you generally see there is not much of variety and like marketing team said , people need trendy , they are bored of black and white .
7175	0	a	So you generally see rectangular shape , very monotonous kind of designs here .
7176	0	a	And second thing is there is too much of confusion here .
7177	0	a	No particular remote is standard .
7178	0	a	Like , some some people have a
7179	0	a	Here you see this ?
7180	0	a	This is on a I I
7181	0	a	I found th that only common feature is the ch channel control and volume control , rest other buttons , they are in a very disorganized and they are not consistent th with other models and all .
7182	0	a	Okay .
7183	0	a	Okay , and second as already discussed with William , we are going to have m maybe a G GUI interface in the f in the middle of the flip top and g graphic user interface basically which is what we d do in computer , have icons or touch pad or whatever ,
7184	0	a	which is
7185	0	a	Like you have on a l
7186	0	a	icons or something y you have is a good example of GUI graphic user interface .
7187	0	a	Yeah .
7188	0	a	Sorry what does that stand for ?
7189	0	a	Okay .
7190	0	a	Which means
7191	0	a	Okay .
7192	0	a	Yeah .
7193	0	a	If you if
7194	0	a	yeah if you have like buttons that appear on the screen in this LCD screen .
7195	0	a	Yeah .
7196	0	a	So basically not point or click Press any particular device , he just has to click on that particular icon to simplify .
7197	0	a	Okay .
7198	0	a	And on the top m repetitive buttons which are like volume or channel changing and all could be on the pointing device , that means the use of button .
7199	0	a	So he need not use a pointer to keep changing the channel if a person is frequent surfer .
7200	0	a	So we are having a combination of boards , so f on the s simpler board , on the top we have this button , rubber buttons , to keep frequently changing the channels .
7201	1	a	Can we swap that round so th that the ones that we use all the time are on the bottom part ?
7202	0	a	Cause if you are thinking about holding it you would be using your thumbs to press , just like a mobile phone .
7203	0	a	Yeah .
7204	0	a	No you would hold it you do not if you flip it open then you would be
7205	0	a	Would not you ?
7206	0	a	Is not that the idea ?
7207	0	a	You us
7208	0	a	if we just use the shell as an example again , you open that , you have got your LCD display there
7209	0	a	and you have got the buttons there
7210	0	a	so you are holding it in the palm of your hand ,
7211	0	a	yeah .
7212	0	a	Yeah .
7213	0	a	Yeah ,
7214	0	a	yeah
7215	0	a	but you can do it with your thumb li
7216	0	a	Yeah .
7217	0	a	That is what I was just saying ,
7218	1	a	and then have the and then have the LCD at the top and then be able to touch that for the other controls , so have the the volume and the programme , things like that , on the lower side .
7219	0	a	But
7220	0	a	Okay
7221	0	a	and you mean to the
7222	1	a	And the lower distance .
7223	0	a	Oh f perfect .
7224	0	a	Okay .
7225	0	a	So the findings are too many cluttered buttons .
7226	0	a	Repetition of certain but buttons which I already explained , example the volume and channel control buttons .
7227	0	a	All are confusing and in inconsistent .
7228	0	a	Okay we had a latest finding of voice recognition , there was a mail which mentions that our division has developed a new speech recognition s feature .
7229	0	a	We have to check into the for financial f feasibility whether we can incorporate it this at a low cost ,
7230	0	a	but for
7231	0	a	like we had
7232	0	a	g s response from the customers that they would like to have the feature of finding it .
7233	0	a	So it could be like , where is the remote , and the remote answers I am here .
7234	0	a	Yeah .
7235	0	a	Some kind of thing or it gives a b bleep sound or some kind of sound and if this can be incorporated this would be more you can say trendy also ?
7236	0	a	And technologically innovative also .
7237	0	a	Yeah .
7238	1	a	So we we can check into the financial feasibility of incorporating this .
7239	0	a	My personal preferences would be like , as already marketing department , they want something to do with fruit
7240	0	a	so I would not say the design should be like a fruit ,
7241	1	a	but yeah we can take inspiration from fruit colours , like the vibrant colours , red chilli tomato red or whatever and second thing is cer certain standard buttons we should have ,
7242	0	a	like for example , i if you see the previous slide I think most of the users would now be well acquainted with this cer central pattern , here ,
7243	1	a	so we we we would not change h that particular pattern
7244	0	a	because i this is the most consistent thing in all remote controls .
7245	0	a	Yeah .
7246	0	a	Well , yeah
7247	0	a	we
7248	0	a	Yeah .
7249	0	a	I ca not see that ,
7250	0	a	is that play and stop and things ?
7251	0	a	Or is that volume and channel ?
7252	0	a	Okay .
7253	0	a	This is central one , the one
7254	0	a	you
7255	0	a	yeah volume and channel .
7256	1	a	So keep that m that standardised because that is the most common feature across all models ,
7257	0	a	if you look at all the models , it is here .
7258	0	a	This and voice recognition .
7259	0	a	Right .
7260	0	a	Okay .
7261	0	a	I am not sure how long we have got left ,
7262	1	a	but we need to make a decision about the things we have discussed .
7263	0	a	So , we agree on
7264	0	a	Do we agree on the battery ?
7265	0	a	Yeah .
7266	1	a	Kinetic ?
7267	0	a	The kinetic .
7268	0	a	Yeah .
7269	0	a	, that means that there is no function for li the port , you know that it sits in , then pressing the button then having
7270	1	a	so we could incorporate voice recognition for the finding it .
7271	0	a	Yeah I think I mean
7272	0	a	if
7273	0	a	Yeah it is it is qui
7274	0	a	it is quite a cool feature to have
7275	0	a	and also if they have got it if they have got these parts already in stock , then it wo not be cheap to re manufacture them , or it will be cheap sorry to re manufacture them .
7276	0	a	It is a bi
7277	0	a	i
7278	0	a	it is like a g
7279	0	a	it is a gadget , it is a selling point .
7280	0	a	So do you reckon that is a good idea that , where is the remote , I am here thing ?
7281	0	a	I think that would be quite fun .
7282	0	a	I think the only
7283	0	a	I think the only pitfall that we would have would be how much it is going to cost if that means we have to cut down somewhere else ,
7284	0	a	but I think pretty much we have used cheap relatively cheap and simple things .
7285	0	a	Yeah .
7286	0	a	Yeah .
7287	0	a	Yeah to s th well
7288	0	a	it is it is not as expensive as it would be if it was full colour cause if we have just got a black and white one
7289	0	a	, I mean they use them in calculators so .
7290	0	a	The LCD is not cheap .
7291	0	a	Yeah , okay .
7292	1	a	Maybe we could start with the black and white .
7293	0	a	Yeah .
7294	1	a	That that way we could upgrade later .
7295	0	a	And you could
7296	0	a	yeah .
7297	0	a	Yeah , we talked about kinetic charging , we have deci seem to have decided on that ,
7298	0	a	did we decide on double A or triple A batteries ?
7299	0	a	No , one of the decisions we had to make was whether we had double A or triple A batteries
7300	0	a	cause they have still got to be charged this way have not they ?
7301	0	a	I
7302	0	a	oh I see .
7303	0	a	Okay .
7304	0	a	Well you cou .
7305	0	a	Do you want like a back up ?
7306	0	a	, okay so we have got battery .
7307	0	a	K no the kinetic ones come come with a sort of w watch a battery that goes in a watch .
7308	0	a	Right , okay , got you .
7309	0	a	So it is a lot smaller ,
7310	0	a	so it would
7311	0	a	Yeah .
7312	0	a	Got you on that okay ,
7313	0	a	did not realise .
7314	0	a	The inside components is pretty standardised across the board is not it ?
7315	0	a	So there is not a really a decision to be made there , .
7316	0	a	Yeah .
7317	0	a	The buttons
7318	0	a	what did you give us as our
7319	0	a	The bare board LCD or
7320	0	a	On the top one okay you have got the touch okay
7321	0	a	and then
7322	0	a	Okay , okay .
7323	0	a	Yeah
7324	0	a	the well I think were we are going for the LCD on that one , on the buttons , on the on the on on the top one we are going to
7325	0	a	yeah .
7326	0	a	On the bottom we were going to have the rubber , the rubber ones , the anti RSI ones .
7327	0	a	Sorry could you repeat that last part ?
7328	0	a	LCD screen .
7329	0	a	, okay on we have got the flip the flip screen , the top one is going to be the LCD and the bottom one is going to be the rubberised buttons .
7330	0	a	Okay .
7331	0	a	And for the
7332	0	a	sorry .
7333	0	a	No , it is fine .
7334	1	a	For the body design I think plastic ,
7335	0	a	w
7336	0	a	yeah
7337	0	a	we could use the body ,
7338	0	a	for the inside
7339	1	a	and rubber as a padding or for the grip , something like to add to the design .
7340	0	a	Plastic ,
7341	0	a	okay .
7342	0	a	For the inside .
7343	0	a	Yeah .
7344	0	a	so we decided on a rubber casing for the plastic shell , a variety of designs ,
7345	0	a	okay .
7346	0	a	Plast right .
7347	0	a	Oh I think so
7348	0	a	, I think so .
7349	0	a	and it is just
7350	0	a	although it is rubberised and spongy , apart from that we are just going to go for sort of vegetable and fruit colours ,
7351	0	a	we are not going to try and make it actually a vegetable or fruit design or anything else , like a shell that we discussed ,
7352	0	a	just go for the colours .
7353	0	a	no .
7354	0	a	No
7355	0	a	I think I
7356	0	a	we do not want to be tacky
7357	0	a	if we have got a kind of different shape anyway the fact the m the material that we would be using would be cheap ,
7358	1	a	so we could make it red , we could make it psychedelic , you know , we could make it black and white zebra stripes ,
7359	0	a	but that is not really what we are focusing on , what we are focusing on is the m you know yes .
7360	0	a	It is
7361	0	a	I it is different .
7362	0	a	Okay .
7363	0	a	The feel .
7364	0	a	So we could just pick anything .
7365	0	a	Kay .
7366	0	a	Is that going to be
7367	0	a	this image I have got in my head of something kind of shaped like that , maybe about that size , made of plastic , fits into the palm of the hand , rubberised cover that is spongy .
7368	0	a	Is that really going to fit fancy look and feel
7369	0	a	which was the major thing that people wanted , market research ,
7370	0	a	is that fancy ?
7371	0	a	It is just different it is just different from everything else
7372	0	a	and I mean , I am trying to imagine clean looking houses , sort of beige and black
7373	0	a	so you either want something that goes with that ,
7374	0	a	which is what is on the market anyway ,
7375	0	a	or you want something that contrasts as
7376	0	a	you know like you get clocks now
7377	0	a	that are more of a talking point than an actual clock because they are so interesting and
7378	0	a	Yeah .
7379	0	a	I am just kind of pushing at that to see if you came out with anything else ,
7380	0	a	but I mean I totally agree .
7381	0	a	We looked at those remotes , I mean they are kind of anonymous , very similar looking things .
7382	0	a	This would definitely be different enough ,
7383	0	a	I just wondered if anybody could come up with something even more
7384	0	a	Well the thing is the rubberised covers are going to be s relatively cheap to produce , that if in a year is time we we get feedback from the design fairs that show something else is coming
7385	0	a	I mean it is so easy for us to just produce that
7386	0	a	and it can be slipped on ,
7387	0	a	which is another beauty of it .
7388	0	a	And you would just have an
7389	0	a	across the b you would have so many different options that you could do ,
7390	1	a	you could have a plain black one , you could have sparkly pink glittery ones for your little
7391	1	a	And ones tha ones that have rubbery spikes
7392	0	a	y you know , you could just go so far with it ,
7393	1	a	like a puffer fish ,
7394	0	a	you could just , you could take it wherever ,
7395	0	a	so I think that is quite a flexible thing .
7396	0	a	Right .
7397	0	a	You can you can just
7398	0	a	Yeah .
7399	1	a	Acupressure , you could talk of acupressures .
7400	0	a	Yeah .
7401	1	a	And finally the body should be retouchable ,
7402	0	a	may maybe ch you can change the body or the case casing the case outside ,
7403	1	a	it should be moulded it with the design in such a way you can change it every time .
7404	0	a	Yes .
7405	0	a	Yeah , yeah
7406	0	a	j with these rubber these rubberised ca
7407	0	a	not the actual plastic outside case , just the rubber thing that goes round the outside .
7408	0	a	Okay .
7409	0	a	The rubber .
7410	0	a	Yeah .
7411	0	a	Okay we have got five minutes , , or that might have been up for a while .
7412	1	a	, so can I just recap Sarah ,
7413	0	a	for the decisions that we have made , kinetic charging , the watch type batteries , LCD display on th the top side of the flip top , rubberised buttons on the bottom side , we are going to use fruit and vegetable colours for the rubber cover , the case itself is plastic .
7414	0	a	Fine .
7415	0	a	Yeah .
7416	0	a	That is how far we have got ,
7417	0	a	what else do we have to add to our decisions here ?
7418	0	a	Fine , we were talking of voice recognition also because that we are not for how to look it remote control if it is lost .
7419	0	a	So , are we looking at voice ?
7420	1	a	Or maybe like William was suggesting in the last thing some devices you put on key chains .
7421	0	a	Yes , it was just , there was just a cost issue with that ,
7422	0	a	but it is a good idea
7423	1	a	we just need to check on the cost ,
7424	0	a	is that right ?
7425	0	a	And incorporating the company logo ?
7426	0	a	For l
7427	0	a	yeah ,
7428	0	a	the whistle .
7429	0	a	Oh yeah , yeah
7430	0	a	the whistle ones , yeah .
7431	1	a	So we can if financially voice recognition is not feasible we could go for a whistle .
7432	0	a	Yep .
7433	0	a	Have you
7434	0	a	Okay .
7435	0	a	sorry
7436	0	a	I did not mention this ,
7437	1	a	but we will be incorporating in the design .
7438	0	a	Cause I took it from the feedback you gave in the last meeting from y from y your report , it is not just a case of having a little RR hidden somewhere , they do want it to be obvious that it is our product
7439	0	a	do not they ?
7440	0	a	Since it is the only one of its kind on the market it is obviously going to be ours .
7441	0	a	Well they do ,
7442	0	a	but I think we can you could
7443	0	a	well it is , it is ,
7444	1	a	I think you just address that with advertising .
7445	0	a	Yeah .
7446	1	a	, you associate the name with the individual product that it is
7447	0	a	and that does the work for you .
7448	0	a	Yeah .
7449	0	a	Okay .
7450	1	a	Obviously it will have a logo on it just like everything ,
7451	0	a	but everything else has a logo on it .
7452	0	a	The point is that it is got to stand out somehow differently
7453	0	a	but I think it does , without that
7454	0	a	so I am not worried about that .
7455	0	a	Okay .
7456	0	a	Okay .
7457	0	a	Did we
7458	0	a	I know at the last meeting we spoke about a beeper , I think that was you talked about a beeper for a location ,
7459	0	a	have we just rejected that in favour of voice recognition then ?
7460	0	a	Depending on how i I mean we have got this memo saying that it is something that the company is looking into , so
7461	0	a	that seems to make sense , but if it turns out that it is hugely expensive we would have to cut down somewhere else , then it is worth thinking about .
7462	0	a	Yeah , depending on the expense of it .
7463	0	a	And they have got in stock ,
7464	0	a	so yeah .
7465	0	a	But I think we will find out more about cost afterwards .
7466	0	a	Yeah .
7467	1	a	Right I am going to wrap it up there .
7468	0	a	Okay .
7469	0	a	Fine .
7470	0	a	I got a end meeting now message on my mo yeah
7471	0	a	so .
7472	0	a	Yeah .
7473	0	a	Again a questionnaire huh ?
7474	0	a	so I think we have probably got
7475	0	a	it says , closing we have forty minutes
7476	0	a	so I think we have probably got about that time before we come back .
7477	0	a	It is either that or we only had forty minutes to discuss what we just discussed and do not know how long that took .
7478	0	a	Is everyone happy ?
7479	0	a	 
7480	0	a	If you leave them on the whole time you get to look like a noodle the whole time .
7481	0	a	Is that someone is ?
7482	0	a	Okay .
7483	0	a	Is that .
7484	0	a	Thank you .
7485	0	a	three , apparently .
7486	0	a	Okay ,
7487	0	a	you all switched on .
7488	0	a	Yep , me too .
7489	0	a	I presume we are good to go .
7490	0	a	Okay ,
7491	1	a	minutes
7492	0	a	we decided to use a kinetic charger , standard chip , cause it can come in various different sizes , it was not going to be a problem factor .
7493	0	a	We wanted a stand by function .
7494	0	a	The case material is going to be soft , rubbery , changeable .
7495	0	a	buttons with a combination of LCD and rubber according to the design .
7496	0	a	bright funky designs inspired by fruit , keeping with the hip kind of feel .
7497	0	a	and to try and incorporate voice recognition software into our design until we can find out more about the cost of things like that .
7498	0	a	and the rubber buttons that we will use will be anti RSI .
7499	0	a	Okay ?
7500	1	a	Prototype presentation .
7501	0	a	Is that for us ?
7502	0	a	Okay .
7503	0	a	I think that would be you .
7504	0	a	Yep .
7505	0	a	Me and William worked on a prototype ,
7506	1	a	and I think William is going to make a p presentation on that .
7507	0	a	Yeah ,
7508	0	a	shall I show ?
7509	1	a	I will show .
7510	0	a	Yeah .
7511	0	a	Though do you do you want to do you want to sh
7512	0	a	do you want to hold it
7513	1	a	and I will I will show you the presentation .
7514	0	a	Make sure the camera is
7515	0	a	Yes , yes you can .
7516	1	a	I can hold it like
7517	0	a	Yeah ,
7518	0	a	so It looks
7519	0	a	crazy .
7520	0	a	Can I just nick your
7521	0	a	Whoa .
7522	1	a	Wait a second ,
7523	1	a	I will get it out .
7524	0	a	Okay .
7525	0	a	Going a bit crazy over here .
7526	0	a	Thank you .
7527	1	a	You should have one of those things and you can just take it off .
7528	0	a	not now .
7529	0	a	Oh .
7530	0	a	Yeah .
7531	0	a	Ta da .
7532	0	a	Oh ,
7533	0	a	where are the hinges ?
7534	0	a	Kay .
7535	0	a	Okay , so
7536	0	a	this is our look and feel presentation , the final our final presentation .
7537	0	a	Right .
7538	0	a	kay .
7539	1	a	And we will first look at the exterior of what we have come up with over there .
7540	0	a	It is going to have a a plastic body with a sort of standard colour , either we are thinking some something fairly neutral like a a white or a light blue or something .
7541	0	a	You able to look ?
7542	0	a	Yep .
7543	0	a	This is underneath the rubberised the rubberised outer casing which there would be sort of a wide choice they would be attached ,
7544	1	a	but we can we can come up with that .
7545	0	a	Okay .
7546	0	a	the wide choice of colours and sort of patterns , so you have got you have got a lot of customisation with it .
7547	0	a	it is obviously an a sort of clam shell design and the the top LCD screen that you can see that would b would be sort of how do you say , it is
7548	0	a	yeah
7549	0	a	yeah , it would be sort of inset into the into the top
7550	0	a	and the buttons at the bottom would d
7551	0	a	so so it will fully close flat .
7552	0	a	The black and white touch screen
7553	0	a	wherein people can
7554	0	a	Right .
7555	0	a	So it is flush .
7556	0	a	Oh right , okay ,
7557	0	a	yeah .
7558	0	a	Yeah ,
7559	0	a	yeah .
7560	1	a	And working on the inside
7561	0	a	we have already said d decided on the kinetic batteries ,
7562	1	a	which actually , thinking about it now , could y could also probably attach to the flipping open and shut as well ,
7563	0	a	so that you could probably get a bit of
7564	0	a	Yeah .
7565	0	a	So put it in the top section rather than the bottom sections ,
7566	0	a	cause it is the top part that is
7567	0	a	okay .
7568	0	a	Yeah .
7569	0	a	we decided that the voice recognition system , it did actually say on the email that they were sort of coming in and they were fairly easy to get a hold of , so we presumed that they would also be quite cheap .
7570	0	a	So you would have something like where you would shout out , where where is the remote and it will shout back , I am here , or something .
7571	0	a	And then
7572	0	a	yeah .
7573	0	a	Or something .
7574	0	a	It wo it wo not shout out I am here or something .
7575	0	a	It will just shout out I am here , or something to similar effect .
7576	0	a	Okay .
7577	0	a	Kay .
7578	1	a	I am under the sofa .
7579	0	a	oka
7580	1	a	Infrared could be here also .
7581	0	a	Or , that would be too complicated .
7582	0	a	yeah ,
7583	0	a	if it was going like I
7584	0	a	d
7585	0	a	well
7586	1	a	tha that could be something for next time , maybe .
7587	1	a	You can have a remote that tells you exactly where it is .
7588	0	a	the standard , there is be a standard transmission with the TV using using all the standard chips that we have talked about .
7589	0	a	Infrared .
7590	0	a	it would it would have
7591	0	a	obviously cause it is split over two two different layers , it would need two separate PCBs , so it would be joined at the hinge through some sort of cabling .
7592	0	a	And because , obviously , all TVs use this , the same infrared medium , we would just be using using the same thing to transmit the data .
7593	1	a	And the infrared sender would be on the on one of the bot the bottom layer , just at the front of the
7594	0	a	we have not
7595	0	a	I do not think we actually put it on .
7596	0	a	Like here .
7597	0	a	Yeah ,
7598	0	a	yeah , something like that .
7599	0	a	Okay .
7600	0	a	Actually , no ,
7601	1	a	it would be it would have to be on the on the front .
7602	0	a	Yeah , on the front on the front side of that , yeah .
7603	1	a	Yeah , here .
7604	0	a	Oh right , yeah ,
7605	0	a	okay ,
7606	0	a	yeah ,
7607	0	a	I have got you .
7608	0	a	So when it is even if it is open here , the signals would go .
7609	0	a	It is still pointing ,
7610	0	a	yes .
7611	0	a	So when you have actually got it open , it would be facing the TV .
7612	0	a	Yeah .
7613	0	a	Yeah , that would make sense .
7614	1	a	And then finally on to the interface .
7615	0	a	The top screen , as we said , is would be an inset black and white LCD s touch screen which yeah would have all of all of the the available functions for for the remote on it , whereas the bot the bottom screen would just contain the standard buttons , like the vo volume up and down , channel up and down , power on and off , and things to that effect .
7616	0	a	This one right here .
7617	0	a	Okay .
7618	0	a	And now we have we also decided on the inside , we could possibly either have some some kind of sort of bezzled logo on it , or something inset , or maybe an engraving of the logo on the top .
7619	0	a	Which is
7620	0	a	No .
7621	0	a	But not interfering with the outside kind of look of the product
7622	0	a	once it is
7623	0	a	Okay .
7624	0	a	No d not not actually .
7625	0	a	No , not interfering with l the whole look of the the product when it is on the thing .
7626	0	a	Look up to it .
7627	0	a	And finally that is how we put the fashion back into electronics , as that is that is the company logo .
7628	0	a	Thank you very much .
7629	0	a	Yay .
7630	0	a	Wrapping it all up ,
7631	0	a	okay .
7632	0	a	Well done .
7633	1	a	I have now got evaluation criteria .
7634	0	a	Certainly .
7635	0	a	So
7636	0	a	this is the one .
7637	0	a	Sorry .
7638	0	a	It is to be presented .
7639	1	a	There you go .
7640	0	a	Logged in ?
7641	0	a	Thank you .
7642	0	a	Oops .
7643	0	a	Okay .
7644	0	a	Evaluation .
7645	0	a	I
7646	0	a	I think this is chip .
7647	0	a	It is quite similar to what it was before , though .
7648	0	a	Okay .
7649	0	a	Sorry .
7650	0	a	This stage of the evaluation is really for us as a team to evaluate if we have now got a product specification and prototype design that meets the the criteria that we got from our market research .
7651	0	a	So this is the first stage of the evaluation .
7652	0	a	Now ,
7653	0	a	the collection of the criteria , as we saw in our previous meeting , was based on the user requirements and trends found in the marketing reports and marketing strategy of our company .
7654	0	a	So it is what we have discussed in the last meeting ,
7655	0	a	are we actually meeting those trends and requirements ?
7656	0	a	Now
7657	0	a	the findings that we came up with , just a recap , are here .
7658	0	a	The criteria that we want in this remote control are a fancy look and feel , technological innovation , it should be easy to use , it should incorporate current fashion trends , and those the two main ones , they were the spongy texture and the fruit and vegetable strong design colours .
7659	0	a	The design should minimise RSI and be easy to locate and we were still slightly ambivalent as to whether to use voice recognition there , though that did seem to be the favoured strategy , but there was also , on the sideline , the though of maybe having a beeper function .
7660	0	a	Okay , so
7661	1	a	we can come back to that slide , if you do not have a note of those .
7662	1	a	I will just show you how we are going to evaluate our own feedback to this , to what we have so far .
7663	0	a	We are going to use a seven point scale , where one is true and seven is false .
7664	0	a	We look at each of those criteria that I have just mentioned ,
7665	1	a	I will call that slide back up , and I will just do a preliminary rating of all those criteria on the whiteboard here .
7666	0	a	Yeah .
7667	0	a	Does that seem clear ?
7668	0	a	Any questions there ?
7669	0	a	So
7670	0	a	we are going to look at these crite
7671	0	a	Yes ,
7672	0	a	we are going to come to
7673	0	a	w we will discuss each one and we will come to a consensus rating between one and seven .
7674	0	a	, it is perfect .
7675	0	a	Is it everybody is going to evaluate , or just the Market
7676	0	a	okay .
7677	0	a	Okay .
7678	0	a	Is that okay ?
7679	0	a	One is true , seven is false .
7680	0	a	Kay .
7681	0	a	Right .
7682	0	a	So
7683	1	a	I wo not write all of that out again .
7684	1	a	It will just be criteria one , two , three , four , five , six ,
7685	0	a	or A , B , C , D , E , F
7686	0	a	to confuse it with the number rating .
7687	0	a	B , C , D , E , F .
7688	0	a	This is where I realise how tiny I actually am .
7689	1	a	Just write small .
7690	0	a	Criteria and rating .
7691	1	a	Actually , it might be an idea , if we each did give our own individual rating , and we could take an average at the end .
7692	0	a	How about that ?
7693	0	a	Okay .
7694	0	a	Yeah .
7695	0	a	Yeah ,
7696	0	a	so you can
7697	0	a	Kay .
7698	0	a	Yeah , okay .
7699	0	a	That works .
7700	1	a	So I will just separate the ratings by obliques ,
7701	1	a	and if we go one , two , three , four , we know who is who .
7702	0	a	Yeah .
7703	0	a	Okay .
7704	0	a	Criteria A , the fancy look and feel .
7705	0	a	How do we feel about this prototype model relating to fancy it is a fancy look and feel .
7706	0	a	One is true , seven is false .
7707	0	a	My own rating for that would be a two .
7708	0	a	One is true and seven is false .
7709	0	a	I would agree .
7710	0	a	Yeah , I would
7711	0	a	yeah
7712	0	a	I would probably put it two
7713	0	a	yeah , two or three .
7714	1	a	I will just go this way .
7715	0	a	Okay .
7716	0	a	Two .
7717	0	a	No , three .
7718	0	a	Three .
7719	0	a	Okay .
7720	0	a	I would say two .
7721	0	a	Two .
7722	0	a	I would say four .
7723	0	a	A four , okay .
7724	0	a	Adding those up , we have got a six and a five , eleven divided by four is what ?
7725	0	a	two and three quarters , it that right .
7726	0	a	yeah .
7727	0	a	Almost three .
7728	0	a	Two and three quarters ?
7729	0	a	Okay .
7730	0	a	I think yeah .
7731	0	a	Yeah ,
7732	0	a	yeah .
7733	0	a	Two point seven five , there we go .
7734	0	a	Okay ,
7735	0	a	criteria B , criterion B , technologically innovative .
7736	0	a	I would give that a three .
7737	0	a	I would give it a one .
7738	0	a	Okay .
7739	0	a	Not that you are biased in that it the designer .
7740	0	a	No , no , not at all .
7741	0	a	A two .
7742	0	a	Oh
7743	0	a	sorry ,
7744	0	a	I
7745	0	a	I got it wrong .
7746	0	a	The first one rating ,
7747	0	a	I am sorry .
7748	0	a	Can you just make it two ?
7749	0	a	The first .
7750	0	a	The average
7751	0	a	oh , for you ?
7752	0	a	You want your rating to be a two ?
7753	0	a	Is that what you are saying ?
7754	0	a	Okay .
7755	0	a	Yeah ,
7756	0	a	I I just it the other way .
7757	0	a	in
7758	0	a	Yep ,
7759	0	a	I just got two point
7760	0	a	f
7761	0	a	One is a , seven is false ,
7762	0	a	okay .
7763	0	a	So ,
7764	1	a	I will work out the average for that again at the end .
7765	0	a	It is a very slightly altered
7766	0	a	Okay ,
7767	0	a	and we are just waiting for your rating
7768	0	a	f
7769	0	a	Two point five , okay .
7770	0	a	It is just two point five for that one .
7771	0	a	Yeah .
7772	0	a	Losing one decimal place , that is okay .
7773	0	a	So what are you rating for this one , Paw ?
7774	0	a	Two , okay .
7775	0	a	Two .
7776	0	a	So that is eight .
7777	0	a	That brings it down to two ,
7778	0	a	nice and simple ,
7779	0	a	yeah .
7780	0	a	Two .
7781	0	a	Okay ,
7782	0	a	ease of use .
7783	0	a	Easy to use ?
7784	0	a	Based on what you have said there , I would say a one , true .
7785	0	a	Two .
7786	0	a	Two .
7787	0	a	I would say a two .
7788	0	a	A two , okay .
7789	0	a	I would say a two .
7790	0	a	Two .
7791	0	a	Two .
7792	0	a	I should have said a two to make the arithmetic easy , should not I ?
7793	1	a	We will just put almost two , because I am not going to get into silly decimal places .
7794	0	a	One point seven f five .
7795	0	a	Yeah .
7796	0	a	Okay , .
7797	0	a	Okay .
7798	1	a	Or we or if we want to really bring it down , we can do later .
7799	1	a	now we are looking at
7800	0	a	it incorporates current fashion trends ,
7801	0	a	now that is particularly in relation to our market research findings about the spongy texture to the exterior and the fruit and vegetable design colours .
7802	0	a	D .
7803	0	a	One .
7804	0	a	Yeah .
7805	0	a	Right .
7806	0	a	So
7807	0	a	I am just thinking , before I give it my rating , you were limited in the use of materials for your prototype here .
7808	0	a	Yeah ,
7809	0	a	that is
7810	0	a	No , no , the the base colour was white or or like or l sort of a light blue , but the changeable fa faces would allow you to get any basically any one of a number of colours that th it is full sort of customised .
7811	0	a	Is this actually going to be the colours that you would use ?
7812	0	a	Right .
7813	0	a	White .
7814	0	a	With
7815	0	a	for the plastic ?
7816	0	a	blue .
7817	0	a	Any
7818	0	a	Right .
7819	0	a	So we could use any strong fruit and veg colours and that is what we are intending to do .
7820	0	a	Yeah ,
7821	0	a	yeah ,
7822	0	a	yeah
7823	0	a	and
7824	0	a	No , no , cause th that is that is the the spongy feel would be in the rubber that you put round it , that otherwise it is just sort of hard plastic .
7825	0	a	Okay .
7826	0	a	And the spongy feel is no problem with that .
7827	0	a	Yeah , because you will be having a Because of the rubber case .
7828	0	a	Okay .
7829	0	a	In that case it is got to be a one for me .
7830	0	a	Yeah , I will give it a one as well .
7831	0	a	Yep .
7832	0	a	Everybody ?
7833	0	a	Okay .
7834	0	a	One .
7835	0	a	One .
7836	0	a	That part was nice and easy .
7837	0	a	Yeah .
7838	0	a	Okay .
7839	1	a	moving on
7840	0	a	to does the design minimise repetitive strain injury .
7841	0	a	I do not think we have really touched on that a lot .
7842	0	a	No .
7843	0	a	We have we have discussed it , we have not really come up with anything that we felt could feasibly reduce that .
7844	0	a	We have talked about pointers ,
7845	1	a	but the very use of a remote control , if you are someone who is zapping , who is sitting like that , and we found so many people did , how do you minimise that on such a small device ?
7846	0	a	Yeah .
7847	0	a	Well
7848	1	a	the type of button that we are going to use in the bottom half , the material , minimises RSI
7849	0	a	it is meant to .
7850	0	a	It is meant to be .
7851	0	a	maybe because it is slightl
7852	0	a	with the size that we have got it is quite small , but with the amount of stuff we are putting on it is not that much .
7853	0	a	So maybe because there is more space , it is not kind of moving around trying to hit accurately the buttons in between .
7854	0	a	Right .
7855	0	a	It is quite obvious just big buttons .
7856	0	a	Right .
7857	0	a	Four .
7858	1	a	I think I am going to have to be neutral on that
7859	0	a	and give it a four .
7860	0	a	Yeah .
7861	0	a	Yeah ,
7862	0	a	I would I would f I would go for a five , actually ,
7863	0	a	cause
7864	0	a	Yep .
7865	0	a	A five , okay .
7866	0	a	Four and a four
7867	0	a	okay .
7868	0	a	Four .
7869	0	a	Twenty one is that twenty one ?
7870	0	a	So that is four point two five .
7871	0	a	And finally , last but not least , easy to locate .
7872	0	a	Now we talked about voice recognition , we talked about a beeper ,
7873	0	a	have we really
7874	0	a	have the designers come to any dec real decision on that ?
7875	0	a	It was the I am here thing ,
7876	0	a	yep .
7877	0	a	Yeah .
7878	0	a	Yeah , it was it was a voice voice recognition ,
7879	0	a	yeah .
7880	0	a	Voice r recognition .
7881	0	a	And are we happy with the costs on that ?
7882	0	a	That is going to be feasible , cost wise .
7883	0	a	Yeah ,
7884	0	a	yeah , that
7885	0	a	yeah , that is feasible .
7886	0	a	That sounds good then .
7887	0	a	I would go for a
7888	0	a	I ca
7889	1	a	we can adjust the volume on that , just as we could volume on TV .
7890	0	a	I think it would r
7891	0	a	I think it would probably be a a stand it would be a stand
7892	0	a	it would be quite loud .
7893	1	a	So if sombody is in the other room or if TVs in different rooms , or .
7894	0	a	A standard .
7895	0	a	It would be .
7896	0	a	Right .
7897	0	a	Okay .
7898	0	a	So it would be s p
7899	0	a	yeah .
7900	0	a	You built into the feature .
7901	0	a	And if you did not hear it in the room that you were standing in , then you would realise that it was not in that room , you would go into another room .
7902	0	a	Okay .
7903	0	a	Logical .
7904	0	a	That is a one for me .
7905	0	a	Yeah , one .
7906	0	a	One and one ,
7907	0	a	good .
7908	0	a	One .
7909	0	a	I do realise that we might be being fairly biased ,
7910	0	a	cause it is our product ,
7911	0	a	but W I thin
7912	0	a	yeah ,
7913	0	a	I think
7914	0	a	yeah .
7915	0	a	So ,
7916	0	a	how do we feel about this ?
7917	0	a	We have got our our we have got the highest rating of meeting the specifications that is definitely true for two of the six criteria there .
7918	0	a	That is for incorporates current fashion trends and is easy to locate .
7919	0	a	The lowest rating we have got , which is really n
7920	0	a	it is not terribly low ,
7921	0	a	i it is close around neutral is for the minimisation of repetitive strain injury .
7922	0	a	Do we feel on the basis of tha of these evaluation findings that we can go ahead and now produce this as a prototype and market it , or do we have to make further modifications ?
7923	0	a	We happy to go ahead ?
7924	0	a	Yeah .
7925	0	a	I do not think so .
7926	0	a	I think we yeah .
7927	0	a	I think we are set .
7928	0	a	I think for most of those ratings that it is high enough at the upper end of the scale for us to go ahead with that ,
7929	0	a	and I really doubt if on the basis of current technology and our current capabilities , we could actually do much more to minimise that .
7930	0	a	Do much apart from having a huge big Do not think so .
7931	0	a	I know .
7932	0	a	Okay .
7933	0	a	Well ,
7934	0	a	I hope that is clear to the team .
7935	0	a	Is there anything you would like to to ask me about the findings
7936	1	a	before I sum up ?
7937	0	a	Good .
7938	0	a	No .
7939	0	a	Fine then .
7940	1	a	I will just leave it there .
7941	0	a	Oops .
7942	0	a	Okay ,
7943	0	a	thank you .
7944	0	a	Okay ,
7945	1	a	I have got finance here now .
7946	1	a	I am going to plug this in
7947	0	a	so you can all see it ,
7948	0	a	if that is okay .
7949	0	a	Oh yes .
7950	0	a	You want me to b unplug that ?
7951	0	a	That is all .
7952	0	a	Yes .
7953	0	a	Thanks .
7954	0	a	Right .
7955	0	a	Okay .
7956	0	a	Now
7957	0	a	I presume that the screen will go blank ,
7958	0	a	that
7959	0	a	Okay .
7960	0	a	We just type numbers into this and we come out with the final value .
7961	0	a	So are we still on for kinetic ?
7962	0	a	Okay .
7963	0	a	Yeah .
7964	0	a	Yes .
7965	0	a	See , it woulda been handy to have this at the beginning .
7966	0	a	it might have influenced our choice .
7967	0	a	Right ,
7968	0	a	what is happening with the electronics ?
7969	0	a	Double curved .
7970	0	a	It was a regular chip on print
7971	0	a	and
7972	0	a	Oh ,
7973	0	a	no , no , no ,
7974	0	a	the
7975	0	a	Yeah ,
7976	0	a	it is
7977	0	a	you you have put in three for the number of kinetic cells ,
7978	1	a	there should just be one .
7979	0	a	Chip on print .
7980	0	a	In the top , it is the number
7981	0	a	of c
7982	0	a	yeah .
7983	0	a	Oh , right ,
7984	0	a	okay .
7985	0	a	Thanks .
7986	0	a	Yeah ,
7987	0	a	and yeah , just a
7988	0	a	no ,
7989	0	a	one reg v
7990	0	a	Yeah , one of them and one sample sensor and sample speaker .
7991	0	a	So , would there be two ?
7992	0	a	One chip .
7993	0	a	Okay .
7994	0	a	Okay .
7995	0	a	Yep .
7996	0	a	And they are double curved .
7997	0	a	No .
7998	0	a	Y
7999	0	a	Two , cause it is two .
8000	0	a	Single curved .
8001	0	a	One double curve .
8002	0	a	Two curves , yeah .
8003	0	a	But it has a slightly flattened bottom so it can sit .
8004	0	a	So it can rest .
8005	0	a	So
8006	0	a	what is a single curve then ?
8007	0	a	So
8008	0	a	just one double
8009	0	a	Yeah .
8010	0	a	Yeah ,
8011	0	a	I would say I would say it was w
8012	0	a	yeah ,
8013	0	a	I think I think it is
8014	0	a	One double curved .
8015	0	a	It would just be a flat bottom with one curve .
8016	0	a	like a domed thing .
8017	0	a	Single cu .
8018	0	a	And one
8019	0	a	no ,
8020	0	a	cause one
8021	0	a	yeah , one is double curved ,
8022	0	a	and then the other one is a plastic .
8023	0	a	Plastic and rubber .
8024	0	a	The other curves at the sides , but it is slightly flattened at the bottom so it does not roll over .
8025	0	a	Yeah .
8026	0	a	we have got plastic and rubber ,
8027	0	a	have not we ?
8028	0	a	Yeah .
8029	0	a	Yeah .
8030	0	a	Plastic one and maybe rubber point five .
8031	0	a	And special colour .
8032	0	a	No
8033	0	a	I think rubber , since it is being used just as a casing , we can put point five .
8034	0	a	Do you think ?
8035	0	a	Okay .
8036	0	a	Yeah .
8037	0	a	Yeah ,
8038	0	a	I think it allows the point five ,
8039	0	a	yeah .
8040	1	a	We can use that .
8041	0	a	Yeah .
8042	0	a	What does it mean if you put point five for that ?
8043	0	a	It means we are not using a lot of rubber actually .
8044	0	a	We are using just a very low quantity of rubber compared to plastic .
8045	0	a	It would be like saying we are using
8046	0	a	See , it says case material .
8047	0	a	So
8048	0	a	we are not actually using plastic in the case ,
8049	0	a	are we ?
8050	0	a	It is including , it is including .
8051	0	a	No , no ,
8052	0	a	that is it is as an extra .
8053	0	a	Right , okay .
8054	1	a	So that should not that should not be actually on there ,
8055	0	a	because that is not incorporated in the cost of the remote you get .
8056	0	a	But it is going to be part of the total cost , and there is nowhere else we can we can put that in ,
8057	0	a	is there ?
8058	0	a	There is nowhere else we can code for the the rubber used in the casing .
8059	0	a	So do we not have to account for it in the cost somewhere there ?
8060	0	a	Okay .
8061	0	a	Okay , we will just put it in as we will put in as half .
8062	1	a	Or sh we should just put it in as one ,
8063	0	a	because the plastic is zero anyway .
8064	0	a	Yeah , okay .
8065	0	a	No , we do not step on anyone is toes .
8066	0	a	Okay ,
8067	0	a	special colour , do we need that ?
8068	0	a	N
8069	0	a	yeah ,
8070	0	a	okay .
8071	0	a	Might do , if we go for some of the more exotic aubergines and such like colours .
8072	0	a	Interface .
8073	0	a	Push button .
8074	0	a	Yeah ,
8075	0	a	the push button is one and LC display one .
8076	0	a	One .
8077	0	a	An One .
8078	0	a	And buttons
8079	0	a	Well
8080	0	a	yes .
8081	0	a	Buttons
8082	0	a	Has that not gone up ?
8083	0	a	Oh no , it was seven five it is changed not a lot .
8084	0	a	S Has that not made any d
8085	1	a	if you click off that square now ,
8086	0	a	has that not made any difference ?
8087	0	a	Is it
8088	0	a	oh ,
8089	0	a	it is brought it slightly down .
8090	1	a	I think we could change the battery also .
8091	0	a	Instead of going for kinetic how about going for a standard battery .
8092	0	a	So
8093	1	a	is is uncurved completely and just actually making the rubber case the curved thing ,
8094	0	a	is that going to make a difference ?
8095	0	a	Oh ,
8096	0	a	it is not made any difference ,
8097	0	a	has it? .
8098	0	a	Yeah .
8099	0	a	Uncurved , flat .
8100	0	a	No ,
8101	0	a	we will have
8102	0	a	No , no ,
8103	1	a	you have got to click off to calculate it again .
8104	0	a	It is gone up again .
8105	0	a	No , it just surprises one .
8106	0	a	Oh ,
8107	0	a	it is not calculated it .
8108	0	a	Oh .
8109	0	a	Okay , there we go .
8110	0	a	It is brought it down slightly .
8111	0	a	C
8112	0	a	it might
8113	0	a	you might you might be assuming that that is in Euros .
8114	0	a	It is not a lot though .
8115	0	a	It could be in Dollars .
8116	0	a	And then it would be fine ,
8117	0	a	because the exchange range would make it about twelve .
8118	0	a	Is there anything on the menu
8119	0	a	No .
8120	0	a	We have not been dealin
8121	0	a	we have not been dealing with dollars though ,
8122	0	a	I think
8123	0	a	Okay ,
8124	0	a	so the highest we have got is the electronics here .
8125	0	a	I do not think so .
8126	0	a	No .
8127	0	a	Ri
8128	0	a	I think it is in Euro .
8129	0	a	and the interface .
8130	0	a	If we tr .
8131	0	a	If we moved away from our much loved idea of a kinetic battery and just went with the standard batteries , would that make a huge difference ?
8132	0	a	And people are used to buying batteries , they are not going to say I am not getting this , cause I have got to buy a battery for a remote control .
8133	0	a	And going to a regular bat
8134	0	a	Yeah .
8135	0	a	Yeah ,
8136	0	a	the standard ,
8137	0	a	it it would make one difference .
8138	0	a	The biggest one would be taking away if you took away If you to
8139	0	a	Yeah .
8140	0	a	What I feel is , customers never said anything about the battery .
8141	0	a	It is internal , nobody looks into the battery .
8142	1	a	But shape and colours , that is something we should not comprimi
8143	0	a	Where is that special form ? .
8144	0	a	If if you take away the voice ,
8145	0	a	I I do I do not like to say it ,
8146	1	a	but if you take away the voice recognition , then you have got it .
8147	0	a	Should we see what difference it makes ?
8148	0	a	Yeah .
8149	0	a	Where is the
8150	0	a	where is the voice recognition ?
8151	0	a	Right , okay .
8152	0	a	Yeah i
8153	0	a	yeah .
8154	0	a	No
8155	0	a	cause it is samples sens sample speaker .
8156	0	a	If you took away that , that will make it twelve point three five .
8157	0	a	Well
8158	0	a	the kinetic is three .
8159	0	a	If we change it to the battery it is that is minus three .
8160	0	a	They n n
8161	0	a	yeah ,
8162	0	a	but you p
8163	0	a	minus three plus two .
8164	0	a	Oh , right .
8165	0	a	I keep seeing zero .
8166	1	a	We can do it some other way ,
8167	0	a	we can do
8168	1	a	it does not have to be voice recognition .
8169	1	a	We could do the voice recognition for , you know , business class or something , you know , like an upgraded version .
8170	0	a	Yeah .
8171	0	a	Sure .
8172	1	a	You could choose to have that or not .
8173	0	a	But they but I mean in
8174	0	a	I do not see why we have to sell it for twenty five Euros now ,
8175	0	a	because they w they were saying they were quite willing to pay more for better product .
8176	0	a	But we are still working to head o
8177	1	a	We can put in our recommendations .
8178	0	a	So should we just change the design specification then ?
8179	0	a	Yes .
8180	1	a	Make it costly .
8181	1	a	If we if we are working to head office specifications as this is what this project team is working for , we can put in our recommendations for what we have we have found and what we the consensus that we have come to as a result of the meetings .
8182	0	a	Yeah .
8183	0	a	We c we could s
8184	0	a	Yeah ,
8185	0	a	we could say
8186	0	a	Yeah ,
8187	0	a	I s
8188	0	a	And then say we recommend Yeah .
8189	1	a	But we need to work to that specification to start with .
8190	0	a	And I think the voice recognition sounds wonderful ,
8191	0	a	but our object is so distinctive that that in itself is going to make it easier to locate as a f you know in a first instance .
8192	0	a	as you say , we can offer the voice recognition initially to business class customers .
8193	0	a	Okay ,
8194	0	a	we can make the price fit , and then say if we would had our budget , we would have had this ,
8195	0	a	because it also sets it apart from the crowd .
8196	0	a	Yeah .
8197	0	a	Cause we have done all the background work to go for that if they want it .
8198	0	a	They like their gadgets , they like something that is completely different .
8199	0	a	Yeah .
8200	0	a	It is s something completely different associated with your company .
8201	0	a	Yeah .
8202	0	a	Right , okay , so
8203	0	a	It is two point five .
8204	0	a	So if we take voice recognition out
8205	0	a	we are .
8206	0	a	That will do it .
8207	0	a	Twelve point three five .
8208	0	a	Yeah
8209	0	a	we are close to the budget .
8210	0	a	Is it twelve point
8211	0	a	fif was it twelve point fifty ?
8212	0	a	Two five .
8213	0	a	No , it is twelve point two five .
8214	0	a	Are you sure ?
8215	0	a	Sorry , not meaning to doubt your words there .
8216	0	a	Yeah well
8217	0	a	two , twelve point two five times two is twenty five ,
8218	0	a	is not it ?
8219	0	a	I think the agenda one was where the price was ,
8220	0	a	was not it ?
8221	0	a	No .
8222	0	a	Right .
8223	0	a	Are they really going to quibble about ten P ?
8224	0	a	Or point zero one of a Euro ?
8225	0	a	Which is less than ten P .
8226	0	a	It is twelve point five maybe , then .
8227	0	a	I do not know what
8228	0	a	it said fifty percent of the cost .
8229	0	a	So half of the price would be
8230	0	a	I think it is the first one .
8231	0	a	That is today is
8232	0	a	kick off meeting , .
8233	0	a	Twelve point five .
8234	0	a	So we are under the budget .
8235	0	a	I thought that is what it was .
8236	0	a	Well done , people .
8237	0	a	So we are okay .
8238	0	a	Okay .
8239	0	a	So
8240	0	a	is
8241	0	a	that got us covered for the electronics then ?
8242	0	a	We do not need something else to take that place ?
8243	0	a	Okay .
8244	0	a	Yeah .
8245	0	a	No .
8246	0	a	Cause that that was just a bought on extra ,
8247	0	a	you could just take that out and that would be fine , yeah .
8248	0	a	Okay .
8249	0	a	Seems fine .
8250	0	a	Yeah , I think that is brilliant .
8251	0	a	Except voice recognition , everything is
8252	0	a	Yeah .
8253	0	a	Right ,
8254	0	a	so we have done that .
8255	0	a	Okay .
8256	1	a	Product evaluation .
8257	0	a	We have done room for creativity ,
8258	0	a	have not we ?
8259	0	a	Because we have got decisions that we would have made that we were not did not feel able to make .
8260	0	a	Yeah .
8261	0	a	I presume we discussed leadership and teamwork .
8262	0	a	Yes .
8263	0	a	Yeah .
8264	0	a	in the sense that
8265	0	a	did you feel like a team ?
8266	0	a	Or did you feel like autonomy ?
8267	0	a	Yeah , I would say , as a team .
8268	0	a	Although we had our separate tasks , there was so much interaction , so much that we needed to bounce off each other .
8269	0	a	I think we had a nice time .
8270	0	a	Yeah .
8271	0	a	Find out from each other ,
8272	0	a	yeah .
8273	0	a	And I have certainly felt heard , listened to in that in relevant areas we have been able to , you know , give and take and adjust our remit where necessary .
8274	0	a	Yeah .
8275	0	a	Yeah , I think there was very constructive feedback by everybody .
8276	0	a	It is not like people trying to cut each other .
8277	0	a	There is more of true cohesive teamwork .
8278	0	a	We came to a very predic creative design , yeah .
8279	0	a	Yeah , and
8280	0	a	Yeah , I think .
8281	0	a	And Sarah , you coordinated the work very well .
8282	0	a	Thank you .
8283	0	a	How did you find it ?
8284	0	a	Yeah .
8285	0	a	Yeah , no ,
8286	0	a	I thought it it went really well
8287	0	a	and I
8288	0	a	yeah ,
8289	0	a	I
8290	0	a	I feel that everyone was listened to
8291	0	a	and all the points that were raised seem to have been sorted out , although we did not quite make the voice recognition in there ,
8292	0	a	but that is that is good .
8293	0	a	I think it would have made it into the final product if it was actually if if if we would seen the marketing before the initial specification was put out , I think maybe it would have come out a d little different ,
8294	0	a	but
8295	0	a	yeah .
8296	0	a	Yeah .
8297	0	a	I liked the fact that we could say an idea and it would be suggested that that was not the best idea , but no one felt like shot down ,
8298	0	a	you know ,
8299	0	a	y
8300	0	a	it did not matter it saying what you thought , because if it was not something that was that relevant , then it did not matter , cause it was just another idea in the field .
8301	0	a	Yeah .
8302	0	a	Yeah .
8303	0	a	I like that .
8304	0	a	Yeah .
8305	1	a	teamwork .
8306	0	a	Well
8307	0	a	you two created that wonderful specimen of a Play Doh model .
8308	0	a	Yeah , well .
8309	0	a	I think that was the best part
8310	0	a	of the
8311	0	a	Kay .
8312	0	a	I am still not caught up .
8313	0	a	But that is nothing to do with the teamwork at all .
8314	0	a	Maybe .
8315	1	a	Maybe we should think of branching out into children is toys and fake mobile phones as a side line .
8316	1	a	And fake RCs .
8317	0	a	No ,
8318	0	a	that was quite fun .
8319	0	a	means , whiteboard , digital pens , etcetera , what does that mean ?
8320	0	a	Any ideas ?
8321	0	a	Had time to kind of
8322	0	a	Yeah ,
8323	0	a	cause we could just sort of say , sorry what did you say about that
8324	0	a	or what do you think about that , rather than having to email it ,
8325	0	a	yeah .
8326	0	a	How do we evaluate the materials we had for communicating and sharing information ?
8327	0	a	Could it have been better , was it adequate ?
8328	0	a	Discuss which ones
8329	0	a	yeah .
8330	0	a	Yeah .
8331	0	a	Yeah ,
8332	0	a	I think I think we probably woulda used the outer email system more , had we actually had had more time and if we would been separated more .
8333	0	a	Yeah .
8334	0	a	Yeah .
8335	0	a	Yeah .
8336	0	a	Yeah .
8337	0	a	But it was nice having it there .
8338	0	a	like the whole picture of the thing .
8339	0	a	Yeah ,
8340	0	a	moving around the room .
8341	0	a	Yeah .
8342	0	a	But I think it is good ,
8343	0	a	like we spent times individually .
8344	0	a	I never thought of a remote control with a flip top .
8345	0	a	Yeah ,
8346	0	a	I think it is new ideas in general ,
8347	0	a	rather than
8348	0	a	It is really borrowing from other areas , it is , you know , bringing things from other areas in ,
8349	0	a	it so it is
8350	0	a	I mean nothing is new , but it is applying it to a d in a different area .
8351	0	a	Yeah .
8352	0	a	Vegetables .
8353	0	a	That is mine .
8354	0	a	Yeah .
8355	0	a	Yeah , no .
8356	0	a	Yeah ,
8357	0	a	it is The thing is
8358	0	a	Yep , sorry ,
8359	1	a	go on Sarah .
8360	0	a	Well
8361	0	a	they have to come from somewhere ,
8362	0	a	do not they ?
8363	0	a	And as sh as w
8364	0	a	sorry ,
8365	1	a	you go .
8366	0	a	Absolutely , yeah .
8367	0	a	as was shown by your presentation with all of the other controls , remote controls , no one is thought about it particularly .
8368	0	a	No .
8369	0	a	I mean they are slightly different , so if someone is been shut in the room and said make ours a bit different from everyone else is ,
8370	1	a	cause it is w something we should think about ,
8371	0	a	but obviously no one is put any great deal of thought into it .
8372	0	a	Yeah ,
8373	0	a	I do
8374	0	a	I do not think the the companies are really concerned .
8375	0	a	They are just like we have got a DVD player , does anyone remember the remote control ?
8376	0	a	Ca not you get the one that we used for the last one ?
8377	0	a	Yeah ,
8378	1	a	just jazz it up a bit .
8379	0	a	Yeah .
8380	0	a	d they do not really think about it , because normally , the remote control is not the product which they are trying to ship .
8381	0	a	Yeah .
8382	0	a	They are trying to ship the DVD player , the video player , the TV .
8383	0	a	Yeah , the focus is not on to that , yeah .
8384	0	a	But then when it everything is really smart , and you have just got this big chunk of black thing sitting on your coffee table , it does not go ,
8385	1	a	I mean if you could have something that is a proper funky thing , a funky item that is individual , individual to you , I mean they could even go into you go in with an idea
8386	1	a	and they design it on Photoshop
8387	1	a	and then they just get it printed on the plastic ,
8388	0	a	you would pray
8389	0	a	you would pay a lot extra , because it is individually being a plastic was being made for you .
8390	0	a	Yeah .
8391	0	a	Yeah .
8392	0	a	No .
8393	0	a	Yeah .
8394	0	a	Yeah .
8395	0	a	Yeah .
8396	0	a	But people could have anything that they wanted .
8397	0	a	Surprising to me is like people give a lot of attention to modifying mobile phones , like a real want to see a new launch or something like that .
8398	0	a	Because of the produ
8399	0	a	Yeah .
8400	0	a	And new f television products coming up , but nobody giving much idea to this .
8401	0	a	I think it is really good that this has been very market research based ,
8402	0	a	because just going back to mobile phones , I mean this is the first change in remote control devices that I can really , you know , say is is obvious and visible .
8403	0	a	Like Sarah was telling , everything is
8404	0	a	Right .
8405	0	a	We see it in mobile phones a lot , and tha that is where we have borrowed a lot of our ide our ideas from .
8406	0	a	There are innovations in that that people do not really want .
8407	0	a	Yes .
8408	0	a	Yeah .
8409	0	a	I see people wanting a model of the phone they were really happy with , and they ca not get it anymore
8410	0	a	and it is innovation for innovation
8411	0	a	is sake ,
8412	0	a	and I think it is wonderful our company is so R and D based .
8413	0	a	Yeah .
8414	0	a	Well ,
8415	0	a	it is innovation for money is sake .
8416	0	a	The the people have to keep buying .
8417	0	a	Yeah .
8418	0	a	But forcing it onto people ,
8419	0	a	yeah .
8420	0	a	Yeah .
8421	0	a	It is things that ,
8422	0	a	you know ,
8423	0	a	they might want to buy the thing they really want .
8424	0	a	And you ca not get
8425	0	a	you have got your handset that works fine , but you ca not get the battery anymore for that type of phone , because the phones have moved on , things like that .
8426	0	a	Or there is not a cover to fit it or whatever ,
8427	0	a	yeah .
8428	0	a	Yes .
8429	0	a	It is madness .
8430	1	a	In closing There we go .
8431	0	a	See I think
8432	0	a	I think it was just the produc just the production cost of the phone .
8433	0	a	our costs are below budget with recommendations that they the budget be increased ,
8434	0	a	but I think
8435	0	a	I do not know ,
8436	0	a	d
8437	0	a	what do you think ?
8438	0	a	Do you think that is takes into account overheads like us being well paid kind of a thing ?
8439	0	a	And the heating for the building , do you think our budget includes everything , all the costs that are going out ?
8440	0	a	So it looks well it looks like it is going to be fifty percent profit , you have still got all of the overheads to come out of that .
8441	0	a	Well .
8442	0	a	I think that was just the the physical .
8443	0	a	Yeah .
8444	0	a	So maybe increasing it , you would also have to increase the price that it is sold at .
8445	0	a	Yeah .
8446	0	a	Maybe fifty percent more .
8447	0	a	Yeah ,
8448	0	a	I think
8449	0	a	yeah
8450	0	a	I do not from the market research .
8451	0	a	But I think but you were saying that that is quite
8452	0	a	But I think in the remit that we were given , it was very specific .
8453	0	a	I think we have done what we were required to do ,
8454	1	a	and I think there will have to be another project team or a new project for us to look at at those kind of things .
8455	1	a	I do not think that is something we have to look at and find a way of raising the cash for .
8456	0	a	Yeah .
8457	0	a	No .
8458	0	a	Yeah ,
8459	0	a	it was
8460	0	a	I it is top secret .
8461	0	a	I think we have done very well to get within budget and it still makes such an innovative item
8462	0	a	that I think people are really going to want .
8463	0	a	Yeah .
8464	0	a	Yeah .
8465	0	a	It is a shame it wo not ever get made .
8466	0	a	I know .
8467	0	a	Maybe it will .
8468	0	a	Maybe it will .
8469	0	a	Who knows ?
8470	0	a	Yeah .
8471	0	a	Maybe they are going to steal our ideas and sell it .
8472	0	a	Maybe someone will r run down and patent it .
8473	0	a	it is it is it is a conspiracy going on here .
8474	0	a	the project has been evaluated well and truly .
8475	0	a	That is what it is .
8476	0	a	and we have got the meeting survey and questionnaire .
8477	0	a	There is a final questionnaire .
8478	0	a	Oh , so
8479	0	a	we have got about fifty minutes to catch up with everything that I fell behind with ,
8480	1	a	so I will be delegating in my role as Project Supervisor ,
8481	0	a	so good luck .
8482	0	a	In your
8483	0	a	yeah .
8484	0	a	Celebration , you did not talk about that .
8485	0	a	I think the celebration is the twenty five pounds .
8486	0	a	Either that or we will be dancing on the desks .
8487	0	a	Oh .
8488	0	a	Questionnaire .
8489	0	a	Okay .
8490	0	a	Is that it then ?
8491	0	a	Awesome .
8492	0	a	yeah ,
8493	0	a	just the last , I think .
8494	0	a	I think I have got minutes for two of the meeting and the last thingy .
8495	0	a	Questionnaire done .
8496	0	a	Oh ,
8497	0	a	I did not have to rate you on how much you influenced the meeting this time .
8498	0	a	Was that not the questionnaire for the how you felt you would done in your thing ?
8499	0	a	I do not think .
8500	0	a	Oh ,
8501	0	a	right .
8502	0	a	But do we not sometimes evaluate in these meetings too ?
8503	0	a	Yeah ,
8504	0	a	the the s
8505	0	a	yeah .
8506	0	a	I think yeah , questionnaire seven was the one I did just before the meeting .
8507	0	a	 
8508	0	a	, making a profit of fifty million Euros .
8509	0	a	Alright
8510	0	a	so twenty five .
8511	0	a	kay .
8512	1	a	So , it is go going to have to be be pretty damn trendy .
8513	0	a	So yeah ,
8514	0	a	I have
8515	0	a	The only the only remote controls I have used usually come with the television , and they are fairly basic .
8516	0	a	Yeah .
8517	0	a	Yeah .
8518	0	a	So
8519	0	a	Yeah , I was thinking that as well ,
8520	0	a	I think the the only ones that I have seen that you buy are the sort of one for all type things
8521	0	a	where they are ,
8522	0	a	yeah .
8523	0	a	Yeah the universal ones .
8524	0	a	Yeah .
8525	1	a	So presumably that might be an idea to put into .
8526	0	a	But but to sell it for twenty five you need a lot of neat features .
8527	0	a	Slim .
8528	0	a	For sure .
8529	0	a	Yeah .
8530	0	a	Yeah ,
8531	0	a	yeah .
8532	0	a	cause I mean , what twenty five Euros , that is about I dunno , fifteen Pounds or so ?
8533	0	a	And that is quite a lot for a remote control .
8534	0	a	, it is about that .
8535	0	a	Yeah ,
8536	0	a	yeah .
8537	0	a	well
8538	0	a	my first thoughts would be most remote controls are grey or black .
8539	0	a	As you said they come with the TV
8540	0	a	so it is normally just your basic grey black remote control functions ,
8541	0	a	so maybe we could think about colour ?
8542	0	a	Make
8543	0	a	that might make it a bit different from the rest at least .
8544	0	a	Uh huh .
8545	0	a	, and as you say , we need to have some kind of gimmick ,
8546	0	a	so I thought maybe something like if you lose it and you can whistle ,
8547	0	a	you know those things ?
8548	0	a	Because we always lose our remote control .
8549	0	a	Okay .
8550	0	a	The the keyrings , yeah
8551	0	a	yeah .
8552	0	a	Right .
8553	0	a	Okay ,
8554	0	a	that is cool .
8555	0	a	yeah ,
8556	1	a	being as a Marketing Exper Expert I will like to say like before deciding the cost of this remote control or any other things we must see the market potential for this product like what is the competition in the market ?
8557	1	a	What are the available prices of the other remote controls in the prices ?
8558	1	a	What speciality other remote controls are having and how complicated it is to use these remote controls as compared to other remote controls available in the market .
8559	0	a	Okay .
8560	1	a	So before deciding or before finalising this project , we must discuss all these things ,
8561	0	a	like
8562	1	a	and apart from this , it should be having a good look also ,
8563	0	a	because people really li like to play with it when they are watching movies or playing with or playing with their CD player , MP three player like any electronic devices .
8564	0	a	Okay .
8565	0	a	They really want to have something good , having a good design in their hands ,
8566	0	a	so , yes ,
8567	0	a	all this .
8568	0	a	Yeah .
8569	0	a	Okay .
8570	0	a	Kay .
8571	0	a	, what do we think a
8572	1	a	What do we think a good size would be for this ?
8573	0	a	Cause I
8574	0	a	I know as you add more buttons to the remote
8575	0	a	it sometimes gets so big and clunky and there is just like a hundred buttons on it , or you could have a really small slim one
8576	0	a	but then you could lose it easily .
8577	0	a	So ,
8578	0	a	we are looking for
8579	0	a	Kay .
8580	0	a	We are
8581	0	a	Sorry ,
8582	1	a	carry on .
8583	0	a	Yeah .
8584	0	a	Yeah .
8585	0	a	Then you lose it , yeah .
8586	0	a	Okay .
8587	1	a	Kind of , maybe more like a PDA kind of , just hand held ,
8588	0	a	like ,
8589	0	a	cause
8590	0	a	Yeah .
8591	0	a	For for
8592	0	a	remember we are trying to make it for twelve Euros fifty .
8593	0	a	No , I was not , no
8594	0	a	sorry
8595	0	a	I was not thinking of the screen of like a PDA
8596	0	a	but
8597	0	a	Okay .
8598	0	a	Okay
8599	0	a	well right
8600	0	a	we will have to I will
8601	0	a	we are k having another meeting in half an hour
8602	0	a	so
8603	1	a	we should all look into a bit
8604	0	a	, oh actually , no ,
8605	1	a	we will allocate .
8606	0	a	So you do the looking around at other remote controls .
8607	0	a	Yeah .
8608	1	a	, if you could maybe come up with sort of shapes and suggested shades or whatever ,
8609	0	a	and you could look into basically how how it is made IE like how you make it all in one , how what sort of materials are available to you whatever .
8610	0	a	And obviously , other instructions will come from the personal coach .
8611	0	a	Right .
8612	0	a	Which will probably just usurp what I said
8613	0	a	so
8614	0	a	Shapes and colours and basically how to make it attractive .
8615	0	a	So you want me to look at shapes and everything you said ?
8616	0	a	Yep .
8617	0	a	Okay .
8618	1	a	And you look at competition and design .
8619	0	a	Yep .
8620	0	a	Cool .
8621	0	a	Okay .
8622	0	a	Okay .
8623	0	a	So
8624	0	a	we have
8625	0	a	Wait for emails ?
8626	0	a	Okay , groovy .
8627	0	a	And no doubt we will get
8628	0	a	Sorry .
8629	0	a	Oh no , .
8630	0	a	Sorry
8631	0	a	it is okay .
8632	0	a	We will get warnings for next meetings as well .
8633	0	a	Okay .
8634	0	a	I shall
8635	0	a	I ca not imagine these are worth much .
8636	0	a	Okay .
8637	0	a	Fashion into electronic .
8638	0	a	 
8639	0	a	minutes from the last meeting which were essentially that we had decided on roles for each of you , however , there are some changes that I have got from on high
8640	0	a	that are a bit
8641	0	a	well w what I did not actually realise it was that the this is for a specific television .
8642	0	a	Okay .
8643	0	a	Okay .
8644	0	a	So the all in one idea goes out the window .
8645	0	a	And they require that the
8646	1	a	actually I will get to that at the end point number four ,
8647	1	a	we will get what you have got and then we can see what we can adapt from it .
8648	0	a	So , presentations ,
8649	1	a	were you anybody got , raring to go ?
8650	1	a	Raring to go ?
8651	0	a	Okay .
8652	1	a	Yeah .
8653	1	a	Yeah .
8654	0	a	Good stuff .
8655	1	a	Oh I need to plug you in .
8656	0	a	So how
8657	0	a	S
8658	0	a	Sh do you want me to hold it ?
8659	0	a	So , after that ?
8660	0	a	F eight .
8661	0	a	Wow .
8662	0	a	Just about .
8663	0	a	It is a inspired design .
8664	0	a	there we go ,
8665	0	a	just screw them on in .
8666	0	a	Gonna have to swap them round so now , it was function F eight .
8667	0	a	That is the wee blue one .
8668	0	a	f oh sorry F eight .
8669	0	a	Blue one F eight .
8670	0	a	Should do it , good one .
8671	0	a	Okay .
8672	0	a	Yeah .
8673	0	a	Yeah .
8674	0	a	, me again , Rajan the Marketing Expert .
8675	0	a	, as we have decided in the last meeting that I have to find out ,
8676	1	a	sorry ,
8677	1	a	yeah sure .
8678	1	a	Hold on , sorry .
8679	0	a	and if you just click that it will go ahead , one at a time .
8680	0	a	Yeah ,
8681	0	a	yeah .
8682	0	a	actually , sorry I have to see the other , sorry .
8683	0	a	Sorry , .
8684	0	a	Yeah , thank you .
8685	0	a	, yes , I have to look at the market potential for this product , , like consumer likings and everything , what is the potential for this product and are we able to achieve our a net profit or our aims or not ?
8686	0	a	Then
8687	0	a	Sorry .
8688	0	a	P press F five to start it first .
8689	0	a	Okay .
8690	0	a	Yeah , I can , okay .
8691	0	a	Jesus .
8692	0	a	then the methodology I adopted to find out all this was market survey .
8693	0	a	A a detailed market survey on consumers was done to find out their likings and dislikings , what they prefer what they not prefer , w what problems they do encounter in all this type of things .
8694	0	a	And what we got was , we found that if you , what they th what problems they are having with different remote controls available in the market .
8695	0	a	Seventy five percent of users they do find it that the remote controls available in the market are ugly .
8696	0	a	They are not so good looking .
8697	1	a	So , we have to put stress on this , we have to take care of this fact also like our design , should be appropriate , should be good looking for the consumers .
8698	0	a	And yes that is wi this
8699	0	a	will definitely , this can definitely put enhance our sales .
8700	0	a	and even the good thing about this is that eighty percent of users they are willing to pay high pay more for this good looking remote controls also .
8701	0	a	So even if the available market goes for the available
8702	0	a	even if the market goes for the available remote control is less even then we can sell it at twenty five Euros ,
8703	0	a	which maybe which may seem quite high but if our looks are are if the re remote control we design have a good better better look designs , then we can hope that consumers will prefer these g remote controls .
8704	0	a	Excellent .
8705	0	a	Then
8706	0	a	And the second thing , some some companies they think that they should have more and more functions of the users or in their remote controls ,
8707	1	a	but rather than those having more functions in the remote controls we should emphasise what actually consumer want , what they operate , rather than making it too complicated .
8708	0	a	Because mostly it has been found that fifty percent of the users they use only ten percent of the buttons ,
8709	0	a	so there is no point of having ninety percent buttons making the remote controls too bulky , too complicated too expensive a because I think I believe that technology is useful only if the consumers they want to use it .
8710	0	a	Otherwise there is no point of having all this type of things .
8711	0	a	So this will not only reduce the cost of our remote controls but it will increase our profit also .
8712	1	a	So we have to take care of this fact also .
8713	0	a	Then .
8714	0	a	it was function I want to go to .
8715	0	a	Oh you want to go back ?
8716	0	a	Just escape .
8717	0	a	, escape , okay
8718	0	a	thank you .
8719	1	a	Then if we look at this slide ,
8720	0	a	these are in your shared documents , you can see ,
8721	0	a	like
8722	0	a	, sorry .
8723	0	a	Okay .
8724	0	a	Okay .
8725	0	a	So , sorry
8726	1	a	I was just going to say ,
8727	0	a	what was the question for this ?
8728	0	a	Or is are you coming on to that ?
8729	0	a	Okay .
8730	0	a	t look all the market potential , what how we should design consu our remote controls , what they should be there so as to en enhance our profit , enhance our sales .
8731	0	a	So these percentages are are what ?
8732	0	a	Yeah , these are different age group persons
8733	0	a	like
8734	0	a	sorry ,
8735	1	a	I can open it in another way .
8736	0	a	Okay .
8737	0	a	, yes .
8738	0	a	Speech recognition .
8739	0	a	If we look at the costs whether the consumers they are willing to pay more for speech recognition in a remote control or not , we can find that they up to a thirty five years age group we have a very good disliking for this this point , like for speech recognition in a remote control .
8740	1	a	So we can emphasise on this point also like ,
8741	0	a	because it will definitely enhance our sales in this ag in this particular age group from fifteen to thirty five , and I and I think that most of the users of the rem TV are belong to this age group .
8742	0	a	So we should look
8743	0	a	Yeah .
8744	1	a	We are als we we are looking at who buys it as well .
8745	0	a	We can look at that that factor also , so yes .
8746	0	a	, which I think the twenty five to thirty five is usual , sort of .
8747	0	a	Yeah .
8748	0	a	So , and And then
8749	0	a	Yes .
8750	0	a	Fifteen to twe
8751	0	a	Okay .
8752	0	a	I think so .
8753	0	a	if we look at this data how how h how what are the problems the consumers are facing with the existing remote controls in the market .
8754	0	a	They find that thirt thirty five percent thirty four percent of the consumers they find too difficult to operate a remote control .
8755	1	a	So it should be in such a way that it should be easy to learn how to operate these remote controls and we should provide pl spe proper manuals for its use also so as that people consumers could easily learn .
8756	0	a	They need not to have any , much technical knowledge to see to know how to operate these remote controls .
8757	1	a	So this is also a very goo major factor to loo take into consideration to enhance our profits and sales .
8758	0	a	So this is all about market potential by me .
8759	0	a	, yes ,
8760	0	a	th thank you .
8761	0	a	Okay , thank you .
8762	1	a	, follow on with Helen ?

8807	0	a	Okay , so I am the interface design designer , User Interface Designer sorry , I am concerned with w what effect the apparatus should have on the user
8808	0	a	and I am I am also
8809	0	a	I want to point out that our motto , put the fashion in electronics , so obviously we as a company we want to make our products trendy and fashionable , it is a big concern of ours .
8810	0	a	Yeah .
8811	0	a	F five .
8812	0	a	, F five and escape will bring it back and just the left button for advancing .
8813	0	a	Escape .
8814	0	a	Okay , and how do I press n just the next button ?
8815	0	a	The arrow ?
8816	0	a	Okay .
8817	0	a	just a left left mouse button .
8818	0	a	So I looked at existing designs
8819	0	a	and also the information that Raj gave us was very useful about what people like , what people dislike .
8820	0	a	and what people fashionable , because we said people between twenty five and thirty five were the main buyers of of our TV I think .
8821	0	a	Okay .
8822	0	a	So what they like and what they find fashionable .
8823	0	a	Kay .
8824	0	a	And ergonomics ,
8825	0	a	we said ,
8826	0	a	I do not know I have not actually been able to do any of this myself , but maybe that comes up , I do not know .
8827	0	a	That can come under Arlo as well .
8828	0	a	And the findings , well the basic that was the basic function to send messages to the television set .
8829	0	a	That is what people want to do .
8830	0	a	, so they need to be included , , but I have got some pictures here of some leading ones .
8831	0	a	I do not know how to get to them ,
8832	0	a	do I press F five is it ?
8833	0	a	escape ?
8834	0	a	Oh okay , cool .
8835	0	a	if you if you escape then you can see your bar .
8836	0	a	I have not got my glasses on
8837	0	a	so I hope it is this one .
8838	0	a	These are two leading remote controls at the moment .
8839	0	a	okay .
8840	0	a	You know they are grey ,
8841	0	a	they have
8842	0	a	I mean this one is got loads of buttons , it is hard to tell from here what they actually do ,
8843	0	a	and they do not look very exciting at all .
8844	0	a	Kay .
8845	0	a	, personally I prefer this one just because it is looks easier use , it is a bit more sleek with more of this silver stuff ,
8846	0	a	, but there you go , that is what we are up against ,
8847	0	a	and I think we can do much better than that .
8848	0	a	Of course .
8849	0	a	hang on .
8850	0	a	We hope so .
8851	0	a	F five ,
8852	0	a	okay , sorry .
8853	0	a	Personal preferences .
8854	0	a	, well I think we need to l
8855	0	a	I think the ergonomics is quite important , Uh huh .
8856	0	a	Yeah , particularly if we have there was a bit in Raj is about RSI and things as well .
8857	0	a	Yeah .
8858	1	a	And I thought not too edgy and like a box , more kind of hand held more not as computery and
8859	0	a	or organic , yeah
8860	0	a	, more organic shape I think .
8861	1	a	Organic .
8862	1	a	simple designs , like the last one we just saw , not too many buttons
8863	0	a	and as Raj pointed out , only ten percent fifty percent of people only use ten percent of the buttons ,
8864	0	a	so I think what we can miss out on the buttons we can make up for in design and and how nice it looks .
8865	0	a	Sales , .
8866	0	a	Okay .
8867	0	a	, hand held and portable I think is portamint is important
8868	0	a	because TFT have just released I think is it a a remote control for presentations or and a big seven inch big screen , anyway , so
8869	0	a	Yeah , no seven inches is not that big
8870	1	a	but anyway so hand held and portable
8871	0	a	and m I thought about other functions for TV
8872	0	a	but as you pointed out people do not actually want that ,
8873	1	a	so maybe we forget about that .
8874	0	a	Yeah it is like a , yeah .
8875	0	a	It is .
8876	0	a	Right .
8877	0	a	And also the company want to keep it stuck to the TV for to keep down the production time .
8878	0	a	Yeah .
8879	0	a	It is for one TV
8880	0	a	oh right
8881	0	a	okay , sure .
8882	0	a	And so the last thing I thought w which I quickly mentioned in the other one
8883	1	a	was maybe a bit of a gimmick to set us apart from other people , like glow in the dark
8884	0	a	which does already e exist but it is not very widely used I do not think .
8885	0	a	Exactly .
8886	0	a	Yeah .
8887	0	a	Yeah .
8888	1	a	Easy finder with the a whistle function or something , or rechargeable station because it is a pain when you run out of batteries .
8889	0	a	Okay .
8890	0	a	Yeah .
8891	0	a	And I think that , yep , that is it .
8892	0	a	That is cool .
8893	0	a	So , I noticed your talk about speech recognition and whistling ,
8894	0	a	and I was just curious to know , have we done any research into how many people can whistle ?
8895	0	a	, or if
8896	0	a	is that a function we want in the remote ?
8897	0	a	I do not , but
8898	0	a	I
8899	0	a	I know a lot of people do right .
8900	0	a	Okay ?
8901	0	a	, I have not been able to
8902	0	a	, yeah
8903	0	a	or some sort of voice
8904	0	a	Yeah .
8905	0	a	, do you have trouble whistling ?
8906	0	a	Really ?
8907	0	a	Ooh .
8908	0	a	Yeah
8909	0	a	it just
8910	0	a	I mean it has to be a certain kind of whistle too , right ?
8911	0	a	That is costly though .
8912	0	a	Yeah , I suppose that is true .
8913	0	a	Well I suppo you could y
8914	0	a	you could have the
8915	1	a	you could have the basically instead of a whistle if it is got the voice recognition you could have it just , you know , where are you ? .
8916	0	a	Yeah .
8917	0	a	a much easier thing is just any loud noise like clapping , shouting , you know ,
8918	0	a	and then , what would the response be ?
8919	0	a	It beeps back at you or something ?
8920	0	a	Okay .
8921	0	a	Yeah .
8922	0	a	Sounds good .
8923	0	a	Yeah , something .
8924	1	a	Well , let me set this up .
8925	0	a	So I plug it in , press F five ?
8926	0	a	Function F five ?
8927	0	a	Or function F eight ?
8928	0	a	Okay .
8929	0	a	Function F eight for the the
8930	0	a	Yeah .
8931	0	a	Oh you need to twiddle the thingamibobsy thing .
8932	0	a	Okay .
8933	0	a	I think it is just to lock it in .
8934	0	a	It is got it .
8935	0	a	Okay .
8936	0	a	Okay .
8937	0	a	So as the Industrial Designer my job is to take an input from you guys ,
8938	0	a	so it is good you went first ,
8939	0	a	and I jotted down some notes as to what are the b needs and what kind of novel features we can add to differentiate our product from the others .
8940	0	a	Alright .
8941	1	a	Let is remember that .
8942	0	a	so Raj told us that consumers are willing to spend more for fancy products , and he also mentioned that the current products do not always match users' operating behaviour .
8943	0	a	, a lot of the buttons are not used ,
8944	0	a	and
8945	0	a	he mentioned that they are not fun to use .
8946	0	a	And a novel feature which we just brought up was this this automatic speech recognition feature or noise detection feature for when you lose the remote , there could be a little microphone on it , and any noise over a certain threshold it will pick up as a a distress signal from you and it will beep back and say you know
8947	0	a	oh here I am or something of this sort .
8948	0	a	But sure surely that would have to be sort of specific rather than above a threshold cause if you had a loud movie on you are likely to get it beeping back at you .
8949	0	a	Oh yeah ,
8950	0	a	yeah , that is true .
8951	0	a	Well maybe you could have a
8952	0	a	tha that would be a consideration to take into account yes .
8953	0	a	Sorry I did not mean to derail you there .
8954	0	a	Yeah well tha that is for later down the road ,
8955	0	a	and then as for the user interface it should be trendy , and not computery , right , so more low tech and not too many buttons .
8956	0	a	So I took these all into consideration and also I have some limitations from the boss .
8957	0	a	Right ,
8958	0	a	and practical limitations which I kind of threw out the window .
8959	0	a	And so I did a little research and unfortunately all I had to work on was our our corporate archives of the great products we have made before , which include , you know , space craft , coffee makers , and bullet trains
8960	0	a	Or or a high speed train .
8961	0	a	is that what that is ?
8962	0	a	Well that is cool .
8963	0	a	Right
8964	0	a	and having personally worked with all these products I have a great deal of experience with with industrial design of these .
8965	0	a	If you if you can build space craft you will have no problem with a remote control ,
8966	0	a	yeah .
8967	0	a	Right .
8968	0	a	Yeah sure .
8969	0	a	So ,
8970	0	a	I figured , just put them all together .
8971	0	a	You got a a caffeine powered space shuttle train transport to your TV , and as for the user interface problem , you know , too many buttons .
8972	0	a	Give it one button and and it is a you know , for the the cowboy in all of us
8973	0	a	I I am not quite sure what the the function is there but
8974	0	a	Yeah it is a g
8975	0	a	I mean you could have a
8976	0	a	you know a
8977	0	a	Right .
8978	0	a	Right okay .
8979	0	a	Well I like that design .
8980	0	a	Is that just switches on the speech recognition and it is entirely speech operated , is it ?
8981	0	a	Yeah .
8982	0	a	So I think I I missed the budget thing ,
8983	0	a	it was fifty million Euros ?
8984	0	a	And we gotta sell twenty five of them ?
8985	0	a	Right .
8986	0	a	Yeah .
8987	0	a	Yeah ,
8988	0	a	not a problem .
8989	0	a	Fifty million was prof
8990	0	a	As a profit .
8991	0	a	Okay .
8992	0	a	now it is
8993	0	a	fif fifty million Euros we have gotta
8994	0	a	we have g
8995	0	a	gotta make profit ,
8996	0	a	so we are making that at twelve and a half Euros a time .
8997	0	a	Oh okay ,
8998	0	a	so I I mixed those numbers .
8999	0	a	Okay .
9000	1	a	Well I guess more realistically then
9001	1	a	, we need a product that is got some kind of nifty outer casing , cheap plastic , you know , that should be just like a tenth of the price maybe or less .
9002	1	a	An energy source which would probably just be your regular batteries
9003	0	a	, we do not want to have it
9004	0	a	Okay .
9005	0	a	Would it be possible to have the rechargeable idea ?
9006	0	a	Is that is that going to mark up a lot ?
9007	0	a	Yeah .
9008	1	a	Or a little base station or something , .
9009	0	a	Yeah ,
9010	0	a	yeah , we could do that too .
9011	0	a	, I had not thought of that .
9012	0	a	Yeah .
9013	0	a	That might cost more though ,
9014	0	a	cause obviously with batteries we do not need to provide , well we provide the first batteries , but it is more , it is that is cheaper to just provide batteries .
9015	0	a	Yeah ,
9016	0	a	yeah .
9017	0	a	Right .
9018	0	a	I mean if you think about these base stations now it is essentially just a a lead with a sort of self connecting brake in it ,
9019	0	a	so I do not think it would up up the price that much .
9020	0	a	A battery in it , kind of .
9021	0	a	Right ,
9022	0	a	so so the unirs the user interface
9023	0	a	the canonical user interface for these would be just a bunch of buttons , but since we are a cutting edge company , we of course will have alternatives like speech recognition , whistling recognition and rocket power behind our product .
9024	0	a	Okay .
9025	0	a	Okay .
9026	0	a	Okay .
9027	0	a	and lastly the transmission interface is , just some engineering thing you do not have to worry about .
9028	0	a	Okay .
9029	0	a	so here is you know , a great schematic that my apprentice designer gave me .
9030	0	a	as you can see the the remote control have parts and those parts look like that
9031	0	a	and
9032	0	a	you know it is got a little operating procedure that looks something like that .
9033	0	a	And I suppose you all know how it works because we have all used it and we would not be in a company designing remote controls if we did not know what they were so
9034	1	a	personal preferences , I think programmable options which just require a small amount of memory ,
9035	0	a	non volatile memory ,
9036	1	a	just so the user can put in their favourite channels and maybe their preferred volume settings so that when they turn it on it is not blasting .
9037	0	a	that is a good idea actually I like the programmable options .
9038	0	a	Yeah , me too .
9039	0	a	Oh okay .
9040	0	a	And the , the bells and whistles that we mentioned you know , they take more budgeting , more technical expenditure of effort and it is also much more likely to not work if if we add these bells and whistles .
9041	0	a	Right .
9042	0	a	kay .
9043	0	a	Yeah .
9044	0	a	That is all I got .
9045	0	a	Kay ,
9046	0	a	thank you very much ,
9047	1	a	I will take that back .
9048	0	a	Ooh that is tight .
9049	0	a	Right , also so a notice I got not very long before the meeting , so did not manage to forward it on to you ,
9050	0	a	it is
9051	0	a	let is see ,
9052	1	a	I will find it myself ,
9053	0	a	Ta
9054	0	a	nah .
9055	0	a	Okay , I do not think we need to screw it in .
9056	0	a	Just push it .
9057	0	a	Yeah .
9058	0	a	We had that to dis include teletext because it is become outdated , and everybody uses the internet anyway .
9059	0	a	, dunno what Oracle would have to say with that but never mind .
9060	0	a	it is only for the television , which I am presuming means it is for a specific television , and instead of colours and sorta colour options , they want corporate colour and slogan somehow implemented in the new design .
9061	0	a	Okay .
9062	0	a	Corporate colour .
9063	0	a	Yellow .
9064	0	a	Okay .
9065	0	a	Yellow .
9066	0	a	I presume .
9067	0	a	, everything , all their sort of you know the corporate website and everything is yellow .
9068	0	a	And the logo the sort of slogan we put the fa fashion in electronics
9069	0	a	I do not know exactly how sort of incorpor
9070	1	a	I mean , I guess if you are going for a sort of globular shape you could kind of have it working its way round it or something .
9071	0	a	Yeah .
9072	0	a	, where am I ?
9073	1	a	Okay , so , we have to decide on which functions we are going to actually have .
9074	0	a	Okay .
9075	0	a	Kay .
9076	0	a	, now ,
9077	0	a	we had as listed options we had speech recognition potentially , flat screen interface , LCD interface we also want to limit the number of buttons
9078	0	a	so we will pretty much take that one as read .
9079	1	a	We will use the the basic functions for a television .
9080	0	a	No teletext .
9081	0	a	okay hold on .
9082	0	a	Although the the danger with that is , it could look a bit cheap .
9083	0	a	Not enough buttons you mean ?
9084	1	a	So sorta strike a balance between a a few and a
9085	0	a	or it looks like we are just cutting on the
9086	0	a	I do however have this from over my head , that they do not want teletext on it .
9087	0	a	Yeah .
9088	0	a	Well
9089	0	a	On the number of buttons , kind of functions and stuff .
9090	0	a	, okay .
9091	0	a	Okay , cool .
9092	1	a	maybe Raj you could find out what people would think about that ,
9093	0	a	or maybe they will send some information about that ,
9094	0	a	about what people ,
9095	0	a	whether people would require teletext in a remote teletext option in a remote control .
9096	0	a	About cost .
9097	0	a	Okay .
9098	0	a	Okay .
9099	0	a	So I take it your position Arlo
9100	0	a	is that the bells and whistles we have gotta come up with the a gimmick but not too complicated a gimmick .
9101	0	a	Yeah yeah .
9102	0	a	so I mean a a the sort of inkling I am getting from little bits of web chatter that I am getting sent is that they are quite interested in a TFT display , interactive display .
9103	0	a	However that does sound a bit like the more complicated design that rav
9104	0	a	sorry
9105	0	a	Raj said people did not like .
9106	0	a	Although I guess if there is a sort of
9107	0	a	If you think about standard interfaces that people use already , sort of Windows style drop down menus or whatever ,
9108	0	a	I think maybe that is a bit , going a bit far
9109	1	a	but you know like in a basic sense that you could have your basic selection of buttons , and if you hit a sort of menu at the top you have it goes to a different selection of buttons ,
9110	0	a	so it sorta keeps it simple .
9111	0	a	Yeah .
9112	0	a	Yeah .
9113	0	a	Okay .
9114	1	a	glow in the dark , is that sort of with a light inside it or is it sort of glow in the dark material ?
9115	0	a	Okay .
9116	1	a	Glow in the dark material I was thinking .
9117	0	a	So
9118	0	a	Yeah .
9119	0	a	, so I I guess that would be cheaper than a light I think .
9120	0	a	I
9121	1	a	may I say something about ?
9122	0	a	actually I think it is really really very important point as if we look at the market
9123	0	a	because people mor fifty percent people they find that the remote controls are often lost somewhere in the remote , in the room .
9124	0	a	Yeah .
9125	0	a	But
9126	0	a	yeah are lost and means they forget where they have kept the remote control last time .
9127	0	a	Often lost s was that ,
9128	0	a	yeah .
9129	0	a	Lost , yeah .
9130	0	a	But if we add speech recognition as well as glow in the dark then both these factors will help their locating the remote control ,
9131	0	a	like if they come and speak something at the remote control replies to something something and it glows in the dark .
9132	0	a	Both these factors both these points will help them to locate the where they have kept this remote control ,
9133	0	a	and this will definitely enhance our market sales ,
9134	1	a	so we should take it into consideration also .
9135	0	a	That is cool .
9136	0	a	That is cool .
9137	0	a	Okay , cool .
9138	0	a	speech recognition I take it
9139	0	a	I do not , I have
9140	0	a	I know of no products that use speech recognition well .
9141	0	a	Well .
9142	0	a	Oh it is
9143	0	a	They are act there
9144	0	a	there was a remote control that came out two years ago that had a some basic speech recognition on it .
9145	0	a	You could programme it with your channels and then you say you know like BBC one
9146	0	a	and it goes to that channel .
9147	0	a	Really ?
9148	0	a	Yeah , it did not work very well though because of this noise interference problem .
9149	0	a	They mentioned you know if the television says you are listening to BBC one .
9150	0	a	Yeah ,
9151	0	a	or a yeah an advert an advert for BBC two on BBC one will switch the channel for you kind of thing .
9152	0	a	Right , right ,
9153	0	a	and so there was a lot of this , you would be watching the TV and then all of a sudden it would it would pick up a noise and turn it off
9154	0	a	or you know or turn the volume off or something ,
9155	1	a	but if you can work around that that noise problem
9156	0	a	Right .
9157	0	a	Kay .
9158	0	a	Uh huh .
9159	0	a	Well what about
9160	0	a	this might get a bit too expensive actually ,
9161	1	a	but what about something that is built into the TV that you can press and it will send out a little signal you know like the ones that we ca not hear or something that that will activate the remote control starts to beep .
9162	0	a	, that is a good idea .
9163	0	a	So like a kind of backwards remote from the telly .
9164	0	a	If you find if y
9165	0	a	Yeah .
9166	0	a	Right and then it would do just you know , subtractive kind of cancellation of the noise .
9167	1	a	What you could do then would be you have a remote controlled by the TV speaker ,
9168	0	a	or not a remo
9169	0	a	I am sorry ,
9170	1	a	a microphone by the TV speaker and a transmitter there that sends back to your remote ,
9171	0	a	cause you ca not expect the the television manufacturers to to put that feature into their TVs .
9172	0	a	Yeah , that is the only thing , yeah .
9173	1	a	But yeah , then you have like the little se separate module by the TV speaker
9174	0	a	which
9175	0	a	Right , and then the remote control would know what is being produced by the television .
9176	1	a	That we should just stick on ,
9177	0	a	yeah .
9178	0	a	That comes with our remote control .
9179	0	a	Yeah .
9180	0	a	Yeah .
9181	0	a	And that is a sort of basic RF kind of frequency so it will be cheap .
9182	0	a	Right , right .
9183	0	a	Right , right .
9184	0	a	Yeah that is certainly possible
9185	0	a	then an another thing was about this losing the remote and trying to find it again .
9186	0	a	If you do have this sorta speech interface to it , you do not even need to find it .
9187	0	a	You just say you know , whatever you whatever you want the remote for , you know to change the channel or to turn the TV on and off , you just shout your command to it and it would do it for you if it is within you know , within hearing range .
9188	0	a	Uh huh .
9189	0	a	And you know it could be somewhere in the room y
9190	0	a	that you have no idea where it is
9191	0	a	and it would still do its job .
9192	0	a	That could also be built into the TV though , which might make our remote control a bit obsolete .
9193	0	a	Yeah .
9194	0	a	Well , hopefully we are we are ahead of the curve .
9195	0	a	It might do us out of a job .
9196	0	a	Yeah , okay .
9197	0	a	Okay .
9198	0	a	I like the whole sort of remote feedback thing .
9199	0	a	so I think rather than
9200	0	a	and that also kind of takes out the speech recognition in terms of the interference of it not working very well and things like that ,
9201	0	a	so I th
9202	0	a	yeah and expense and the time .
9203	0	a	And the expense .
9204	0	a	So I think if we are going to go
9205	0	a	well I mean like the thing about the there is the problem with the TFT or the LCD kind of thing is if you are also wanting the the kind of organic globby sort of feeling to it
9206	0	a	then you might have trouble incorporating the screen .
9207	0	a	, but I guess not
9208	1	a	I thin we will just we will just pretend that is not a problem .
9209	0	a	and how are you about the glow in the dark material ?
9210	0	a	Is that
9211	0	a	Contrast contra well .
9212	1	a	Maybe not even all of it
9213	0	a	cause we said colours and fashion w were important
9214	1	a	so maybe just like a little l line that is kind of around the outside
9215	1	a	and then you can make the rest a different colour .
9216	0	a	Yeah , no th the material is cheap but it is just the the glow in the dark material needs some light to charge it you know ,
9217	0	a	and then if you are , if you are sitting in the dark for too long it it wo not glow any more .
9218	0	a	Yeah , okay .
9219	0	a	So if it is dow it is d
9220	0	a	yeah .
9221	0	a	Or if it is down under the couch cushions which is where I usually find mine .
9222	0	a	Right .
9223	0	a	Right .
9224	0	a	Okay , well we can use
9225	1	a	we can still use the glow in the dark as a gimmick essentially ,
9226	0	a	if we are going to have to
9227	0	a	if we are going to have the logo on as well , bright yellow logo in our our slogan .
9228	0	a	Yeah ,
9229	0	a	cause what I thought , main
9230	0	a	Slogan , yeah .
9231	0	a	then you know they are going to be fairly brightly coloured anyway ,
9232	1	a	and we can have sort of a a a trimming as well , of the glow in the dark material , just as gimmickyness .
9233	0	a	Right .
9234	0	a	Cause
9235	0	a	yeah , that w more than finding it , that was more like
9236	0	a	you know if you are watching a film in the dark , you can still see the remote control .
9237	0	a	Alright , so n sorta if if if we are gon if we are going to go with the idea of of feedback , sort of remote finder , then that kind of stuffs that one out then .
9238	0	a	That was more of a a gimmick .
9239	0	a	Do you think ?
9240	0	a	it makes it fairly unnecessary then .
9241	0	a	Yeah , unnecessary .
9242	0	a	Okay .
9243	0	a	Yeah .
9244	0	a	, okay so scratch that .
9245	0	a	so we have got
9246	0	a	do we want to go with the TFT idea or the is that far too expensive ?
9247	0	a	Well I mean I think I think the sort of find the finder things I mean it is I could probably write the circuit diagram for that myself .
9248	0	a	yeah we are getting a lot of features now ,
9249	0	a	I I think
9250	0	a	Yeah .
9251	0	a	Well , I think a consideration too is that these remotes get abused a lot ,
9252	0	a	you know they get thrown around , there is a good chance the the TFT screen would break or get damaged .
9253	0	a	They are pretty fragile .
9254	0	a	So is that one of our definite requirements that they wa that it needs a TFT screen ?
9255	0	a	Yeah you think so ?
9256	0	a	Okay .
9257	0	a	Okay .
9258	0	a	no , I mean that was going on ravs Raj is sort of marketing research I guess .
9259	1	a	So we will stick with sort of programmability for the buttons that we do have .
9260	0	a	So that is sort of included in your sub module kind of stuff , you were finding out about teletext .
9261	0	a	Yeah .
9262	1	a	If you could find out that I think we are going to scratch the speech recognition as a bit of a expensive ,
9263	0	a	no ?
9264	0	a	Oh right
9265	0	a	, okay .
9266	0	a	Yeah .
9267	0	a	Totally , it takes cheap speech recognition ,
9268	0	a	she they wi
9269	0	a	Yeah .
9270	0	a	Oh .
9271	0	a	Oh no it is it is much cheaper than the TFT , it is just a microphone and some some integrated circuits .
9272	0	a	Is it not the circuits that cost
9273	0	a	Oh right
9274	0	a	, okay .
9275	0	a	And it would it would be a small vocabulary speech recognition system ,
9276	0	a	like a
9277	0	a	Okay .
9278	0	a	well that kind of takes back the RF the RF remote sort of idea as well .
9279	0	a	Five minutes .
9280	0	a	Okay .
9281	0	a	Decisions .
9282	1	a	, votes , let is vote .
9283	0	a	Who wants TFT ?
9284	0	a	No one does .
9285	0	a	Excellent ,
9286	1	a	so we will go with speech recognition , yeah ?
9287	0	a	, speech recognition , limited buttons , organic design .
9288	0	a	, that is cool .
9289	0	a	if it is not too expensive s
9290	0	a	I think it is a good gimmick .
9291	0	a	And what else was I thinking of that I have not written down and therefore fallen out my head ,
9292	0	a	programmability .
9293	0	a	Glow in dark .
9294	0	a	o okay .
9295	0	a	Yeah .
9296	1	a	And also , integrating the , remember to integrate the logo and the s slogan .
9297	0	a	Okay , so .
9298	1	a	can you put all these reports in the project documents folder if they are not already in there as well .
9299	0	a	So , it just helps me summarize them .
9300	1	a	Yeah yeah .
9301	1	a	Here ?
9302	1	a	Sure .
9303	0	a	And I will put any
9304	1	a	I am I am putting anything I do in there anyway ,
9305	0	a	so
9306	0	a	pro project documents .
9307	0	a	And where is it sorry ?
9308	0	a	Oh .
9309	0	a	On
9310	0	a	AMI scenario controller .
9311	0	a	So it should be when you save on your desktop , so it goes save as , or And then hit that little folder up thing again .
9312	0	a	it is in shared documents ?
9313	0	a	Projoct projector .
9314	0	a	Where am I ?
9315	0	a	Project documents , yeah
9316	0	a	, it is on your desktop as well .
9317	0	a	Again .
9318	0	a	All the way to the top , yeah that is up to desktop .
9319	0	a	Right and then project documents .
9320	0	a	Okay , cool .
9321	0	a	It is not giving anything .
9322	0	a	Shared documents .
9323	0	a	And I will tr
9324	0	a	getting strings of information ,
9325	1	a	I will try and forward any specific to anybody in particular ,
9326	0	a	as soon as I get them now , rather than I was about to sort of tell you about the changes before the meeting , and then the meeting turned up , so I did .
9327	0	a	Okay .
9328	0	a	Did you get my email ?
9329	0	a	Okay .
9330	0	a	Just making sure .
9331	0	a	Okay .
9332	0	a	So
9333	0	a	Okay .
9334	1	a	What I thought as well about the material is maybe not this kind of material , but maybe more like this kind of rubbery material ,
9335	0	a	it is a bit more bouncy , like you said they get chucked around a lot .
9336	0	a	, a bit more durable and that can also be ergonomic and it kind of feels a bit different from all the other remote controls .
9337	0	a	Yeah .
9338	0	a	The rubber rather than
9339	0	a	Yeah .
9340	0	a	More sort of flesh like than plasticky sort of .
9341	0	a	Wow .
9342	0	a	but we have to take care like
9343	1	a	But we have to take care of our children also
9344	0	a	if they
9345	0	a	means if children catch hold of your or if they chew it it should not be too harmful .
9346	1	a	So , whatever material we use it should be
9347	1	a	yeah .
9348	0	a	Oh no , ethics , that is going to cost us money .
9349	1	a	So we have to safety point of view also , we have to take care .
9350	0	a	Okay , safety .
9351	0	a	Oh I think wi with the more organic shape of it it wo not be as it wo not as have many sharp corners as that , so that is something good ,
9352	0	a	I dunno , I mean
9353	0	a	That is a good idea .
9354	0	a	Yeah .
9355	0	a	It sme
9356	0	a	smells good for children .
9357	0	a	We could go comp
9358	0	a	yeah .
9359	0	a	Yeah .
9360	1	a	We could go completely out of the box and make the thing a big red ball foam ball .
9361	1	a	And it is got the thing on the inside .
9362	1	a	And there is no buttons at all , it is always on , and just yell at it , and it works .
9363	0	a	That sounds ,
9364	0	a	yeah it is going to have to be it is going to be have a big yellow foam ball , yeah
9365	0	a	, sorry .
9366	0	a	And then ch children will love it .
9367	0	a	Interesting .
9368	0	a	Oh yellow , yellow ball .
9369	0	a	Yeah , d with the colour , does it have to be all yellow , do you know ?
9370	0	a	No .
9371	0	a	Right .
9372	0	a	Please God no .
9373	0	a	Well , I would not th I mean ,
9374	0	a	my reaction to an all yellow remote control would not be anything other than horror , so
9375	1	a	I think just having it
9376	0	a	surrounding the logo .
9377	0	a	Yeah .
9378	1	a	Small logo with the like a small yellow strip or y yellow with the logo in it .
9379	1	a	Having a little bit .
9380	0	a	Okay cool .
9381	0	a	Yeah .
9382	0	a	, okay .
9383	0	a	Cool .
9384	1	a	And I will see if I can argue with boss about putting the
9385	0	a	what was it ?
9386	0	a	We put we put fashion into
9387	0	a	Whoops ,
9388	0	a	it is not working .
9389	0	a	Ca not believe I have forgotten it .
9390	0	a	We put the fashion in electronics
9391	0	a	Oh yeah , that is a good one that .
9392	0	a	I bet that will catch on well .
9393	0	a	Yeah so .
9394	0	a	Okay , any last worries , queries ?
9395	0	a	Okay .
9396	0	a	Yeah .
9397	0	a	Twelve thirty .
9398	0	a	S s
9399	0	a	I know what you are thinking .
9400	0	a	Okay then , lunchtime ,
9401	0	a	yay .
9402	0	a	That is good .
9403	0	a	Okay , that felt a bit more like a something with order and and reason to it than the last one .
9404	0	a	This is quite fun actually .
9405	0	a	Wow .
9406	0	a	Has anybo
9407	0	a	oh .
9408	0	a	I really do not
9409	0	a	Yeah ,
9410	0	a	yeah .
9411	0	a	Has anybody pressed okay ,
9412	0	a	it vibrates .
9413	0	a	It is pretty cool .
9414	0	a	Yep .
9415	0	a	Wow you have your first page .
9416	0	a	I was just writing really big .
9417	0	a	Yeah , got small writing .
9418	0	a	Yeah I have been using up the pages .
9419	0	a	I have finished the meeting now .
9420	0	a	 
9421	0	a	we are
9422	0	a	So the meeting will have about the same format as the last time .
9423	0	a	So switching over I have just left my first two screens .
9424	0	a	mailed you the minutes of the last meeting just to save time .
9425	0	a	Okay .
9426	0	a	Cool .
9427	0	a	and is there any questions you have that arised from last meeting that are particularly bothering you ?
9428	0	a	N
9429	0	a	No ?
9430	0	a	Okay , cool .
9431	0	a	No , I do not think so .
9432	0	a	No .
9433	1	a	Then we shall start with a presentation from Raj .
9434	1	a	Yeah .
9435	0	a	Hi , me Raj , again .
9436	1	a	in this meeting I I am going to discuss about the trend watching ,
9437	0	a	how these trends is going to affect our market potential and how important is this .
9438	1	a	So we have to look on this .
9439	0	a	First of all methodology .
9440	0	a	The met methodology to find out the trend was incl was done in a way
9441	0	a	We have done a rec not only a recent remote control market survey , but we also considered the latest fre fashion trends of the market , because we think that this is also a factor which will affect our sales and profit .
9442	0	a	So what are our findings ?
9443	0	a	In our in our findings we have seen that
9444	0	a	when we did our remote control market survey we found that people l people do have preference for tho fancy mobi f remote controls which look and feel very good , rather than having a functional look and feel good .
9445	0	a	So this sh this clearly indicates their preference for the design their outlook of the remote controls .
9446	0	a	So we should take into
9447	1	a	we should consider this factor as the most important factor ,
9448	0	a	because this factor is twice as important , the second factor which is further ti twice the as important as the sec as the third factor .
9449	0	a	So this factor becomes the most important factor in our surv in our mark means in take in designing our rem remote controls .
9450	0	a	The last one is the most important one , is it ?
9451	0	a	Oh , sorry .
9452	0	a	No the first one is the the outlook of the mobile , the it should have a fancy outlook , the fancy design rather than just having a functional look and feel good , it should have a fancy look and foo feel good .
9453	0	a	Okay .
9454	0	a	Okay .
9455	0	a	The second most important aspect is that remote control should be a technologically innovative .
9456	0	a	We must have some technological advancement in the remote control tha rather than just putting it as it is as the other remo remote controls are .
9457	1	a	So it should be technologically innovative like glow in the dark or speech recognition , something like that .
9458	0	a	So that indicates our technological advancement .
9459	0	a	And the third most important aspect in the ta to take into consideration is that it should be easy to use , like it should not be too much co complicated , there should not be too many buttons on this mobi remote control , it should not be too complicated like this way .
9460	0	a	And it should be
9461	1	a	and customers should be provided with manuals that is easy to understand in their local language , something .
9462	0	a	So that they could know how to use these remote controls .
9463	0	a	When we did f fashions , recent fashion our recent fashion update shows that
9464	0	a	yeah ?
9465	0	a	Y
9466	0	a	yeah
9467	0	a	yeah ,
9468	1	a	we have to ,
9469	0	a	because d you can see how people have related their clothes , shoes , and everything with fruits and vegetables , because the g world is now changing it is trend towards organic , becoming more and more organic ,
9470	0	a	becoming
9471	0	a	Yeah .
9472	0	a	Sorry .
9473	0	a	I was just reading fruit and vegetables .
9474	0	a	Hard to know how we are going to incorporate that .
9475	0	a	Okay .
9476	0	a	Yeah .
9477	0	a	We should make a big sponge lemon ,
9478	0	a	and then it would be it would be yellow .
9479	0	a	Yeah .
9480	0	a	So
9481	0	a	Yeah .
9482	0	a	Th that is very good .
9483	0	a	It is
9484	0	a	Yeah .
9485	1	a	So something like that we we should do .
9486	0	a	Glow in the dark .
9487	0	a	Okay .
9488	0	a	And people
9489	0	a	the f feel of the material is expected to be spongy rather than just having a plastic look , hard look .
9490	0	a	Well , that is good .
9491	0	a	That is what we kind of predicted anyway .
9492	0	a	Yeah .
9493	0	a	Yeah .
9494	0	a	So so that they could play with it while handi while handling it .
9495	0	a	Okay .
9496	1	a	So that should also be taken into consideration .
9497	0	a	Okay .
9498	0	a	So these are my views .
9499	0	a	Okay .
9500	0	a	Okay , the spongy , not real spongy ,
9501	0	a	you can
9502	0	a	Do you think like rubber would be good or does it really want to be like gel kind of stuff ?
9503	0	a	Okay .
9504	0	a	So No it ca y a
9505	1	a	The rubber which is good for health and which is quite disposable that we can take into co
9506	0	a	Yeah .
9507	0	a	Quite disposable .
9508	0	a	Okay .
9509	0	a	Cause we It should not be have any harm to the environment also , because our company is very well for taking all these concerns into consideration , so we do not want to have any harm to the society ,
9510	0	a	so
9511	0	a	So that is all .
9512	0	a	Oh okay .
9513	0	a	Alright , okay .
9514	0	a	Uh huh .
9515	0	a	Okay .
9516	0	a	Fashion .
9517	0	a	Cool .
9518	0	a	kay .
9519	0	a	Fruit and veg , well there you go .
9520	0	a	Just what I think of when I think of a remote control .
9521	0	a	A remote control ?
9522	0	a	Yeah .
9523	0	a	And were there any factors that were not important in the survey , that they said we do not want ?
9524	0	a	Or was it just
9525	0	a	Okay .
9526	0	a	S we did not find out any such point .
9527	0	a	yes , there could be , but we could not find out any , so
9528	0	a	Yeah .
9529	0	a	Mm mm mm mm .
9530	0	a	Cool .
9531	0	a	Mm mm mm mm mm .
9532	0	a	F , what is it ? .
9533	0	a	Function F eight .
9534	0	a	yeah .
9535	0	a	Okay .
9536	0	a	No signal .
9537	0	a	Oh no , .
9538	0	a	Is that ?
9539	0	a	Okay ,
9540	0	a	and then F five , right ?
9541	0	a	Okay .
9542	0	a	No , it is got it is got it .
9543	0	a	Yeah ,
9544	0	a	yeah ,
9545	0	a	yeah .
9546	0	a	Yeah .
9547	0	a	Excuse me .
9548	0	a	, yeah .
9549	0	a	okay , so the interface concept .
9550	0	a	Yeah .
9551	0	a	The interface specification ,
9552	0	a	what people
9553	0	a	how they interact with it basically , I think .
9554	0	a	so the method , we looked at existing designs ,
9555	0	a	what are the
9556	0	a	what is good about them , what is bad about them , I looked at their flaws ,
9557	1	a	so we are going to look at their flaws , everything .
9558	0	a	and what the survey told us and what we think would be good , so a bit of imagination .
9559	0	a	kay .
9560	0	a	the findings , I have got some pictures to show you as well .
9561	0	a	either .
9562	0	a	Yeah .
9563	0	a	Okay , so most remote controls use graphical interface , where you have got s buttons and you point it rather than having the output as a a stream of text or something .
9564	0	a	okay .
9565	0	a	and we also found that there is inconsistent layout , which makes it confusing .
9566	0	a	So I think for our remote control There is some inconsistency already in ec existing in between remote controls , but I think standard kind of shape and play and those kind of but buttons like the the top right for on and off or something , I think , people find that important,cause then it is easy to use .
9567	0	a	Right , okay .
9568	0	a	Yeah .
9569	1	a	And we have got some pictures of some new remote controls to show you .
9570	0	a	Do I press Escape F five ?
9571	0	a	Or just
9572	0	a	Escape , okay .
9573	0	a	Excellent .
9574	0	a	no just escape
9575	0	a	should
9576	0	a	Kay .
9577	0	a	, oh I still have not got my glasses on .
9578	0	a	Yeah , okay .
9579	0	a	So these are the some of the pictures of existing ones .
9580	0	a	Wow .
9581	1	a	I will just walk you through them .
9582	0	a	This one is a voice recognition .
9583	0	a	And that is the kind of idea we are going for .
9584	0	a	Looks pretty complicated .
9585	0	a	There is an LCD thing ,
9586	0	a	which we thought could
9587	0	a	I thought could get a bit confusing and a bit expensive as well for us .
9588	0	a	Right , okay .
9589	0	a	This one is got a kind of scroll like a mouse ,
9590	0	a	which
9591	0	a	Yeah .
9592	0	a	, like the middle button .
9593	0	a	Okay .
9594	0	a	and But I am not exactly sure how you would use that ,
9595	0	a	like would the computer come
9596	0	a	Uh huh , that is like the LCD one ,
9597	0	a	is it ?
9598	0	a	But the one below that has got like a little scroll function on the side .
9599	0	a	it is kind of like scrolling
9600	0	a	right , well ,
9601	0	a	if I s if I am thinking of the right one , I have got the same thing in front of my monitor , you scroll it and the when you reach the sort of menu item that you require , you press the middle of the scroll .
9602	0	a	Right , okay .
9603	0	a	But I presume that the functions must come up on the TV screen .
9604	0	a	Yeah , presumably .
9605	0	a	I think that is what that is .
9606	0	a	Yeah .
9607	0	a	So these are just a few ideas .
9608	0	a	Again that is just quite boring shape , grey , looks quite space agey , but too many buttons , I think on that one .
9609	0	a	Yeah , looks like looks like something out of a jet .
9610	0	a	it looks threatening .
9611	0	a	Yeah , it does look kind of dangerous .
9612	0	a	It looks like
9613	0	a	yeah .
9614	0	a	this one I thought was really cool .
9615	0	a	It is w it is got the programmability function that we talked about .
9616	0	a	You can put it in there , it is for your kids , and it is quite an organic shape
9617	0	a	and the little circle around there is pretty cool .
9618	0	a	Okay .
9619	0	a	And that is really easy to use , bright ,
9620	0	a	so I like this one lot for our design .
9621	0	a	I think something like that would be good .
9622	0	a	Wow .
9623	0	a	Yeah , I m I mean the one thing I think about about these ones is these kl secured areas , I have seen a lot of them with the the cover missing .
9624	0	a	Of course yellow .
9625	0	a	Right
9626	0	a	, yeah .
9627	1	a	So like have it hinge rather than sort of clip on or whatever .
9628	0	a	Yeah , that is true .
9629	0	a	Yeah .
9630	1	a	so maybe that could be built into one of the things and it comes up on the TV or something .
9631	0	a	And this one , the over sized one ,
9632	0	a	I do not know about you , but I think it is a bit too gimmicky .
9633	0	a	I do not think that will sell very well .
9634	0	a	Yeah .
9635	0	a	I mean is that not sort of to assist the blind or something , is it ?
9636	0	a	Strange .
9637	0	a	I guess so .
9638	0	a	I do not know .
9639	0	a	I think that is a bit
9640	0	a	Yeah exactly .
9641	0	a	Then d blind do not watch TV .
9642	0	a	No they do , they do .
9643	0	a	They listen to it .
9644	0	a	They do ?
9645	0	a	The LCD and the other stuff
9646	0	a	, I think .
9647	0	a	Yeah .
9648	0	a	Yeah .
9649	0	a	And this one is just pointing out .
9650	0	a	I like some of these things the the raised symbols and everything ,
9651	0	a	but pointing out that this one the volume it is kind of pressing down , but it would actually go up , because of the shape .
9652	0	a	Right , okay .
9653	0	a	So that could
9654	0	a	that is a bit confusing .
9655	0	a	but the buttons on this I think are
9656	0	a	it is just showing you how you can have different different buttons .
9657	0	a	They do not have to be all the same .
9658	0	a	So that is quite cool .
9659	0	a	Kay
9660	0	a	but people tend to recognise certain shapes to do certain things anyway , do not they ?
9661	0	a	Brilliant .
9662	0	a	Yeah , exactly .
9663	0	a	F five .
9664	0	a	Yes .
9665	0	a	So there are some of the findings .
9666	1	a	So we need to combine those ones
9667	0	a	and I have just got an e mail from our technical department saying that they have broken through with some new speech recognition software that you can program in .
9668	0	a	That is handy .
9669	0	a	yeah it is , just in time , very handy .
9670	0	a	so
9671	1	a	I think maybe incorporating that in our design would be good .
9672	0	a	It is
9673	0	a	you program it like you say , record , and then , play , and then , record , play machine , and stuff like that ,
9674	0	a	so that is
9675	0	a	And it is much
9676	0	a	Yeah .
9677	0	a	Okay .
9678	0	a	So that is quite cool .
9679	0	a	personal preferences just some imagination , the raised symbols I thought were good , the LCD
9680	0	a	, it does look smart , but I think maybe for our budget ,
9681	0	a	do you think that would be a bit too expensive to have the
9682	0	a	Yeah .
9683	0	a	And the speech recognition , cause I think we are definitely going for the speech recognition ,
9684	0	a	are we ?
9685	0	a	Uh huh .
9686	0	a	But in our market survey we have seen that people are willing to pay more , but they want the quality , they want f fancy look , they want some new design , something new .
9687	0	a	Okay .
9688	0	a	Uh huh .
9689	0	a	yeah .
9690	0	a	But our budget , we have
9691	0	a	Yeah .
9692	0	a	It is still it is still got to get within our twelve fifty , you know .
9693	0	a	Yeah .
9694	0	a	So even if we increase our cost little bit , within some limits , and we give something new technological advancement as well as new design with fancy outlook , I think we will meet the requirements and we will be able to have a good sales in the market .
9695	0	a	Uh huh .
9696	0	a	Okay .
9697	0	a	I am not sure if the if for twenty five Euros per twelve Euros fifty m manufacturing cost , .
9698	0	a	Okay .
9699	0	a	Ben bana
9700	0	a	Yeah .
9701	0	a	I ca not see tha
9702	0	a	Although , th I mean to be to be sure they have got
9703	0	a	I mean they are going crazy with the LCD technology now ,
9704	0	a	so that you have got your LCD TVs and everything
9705	0	a	so maybe the small
9706	0	a	But I mean like I I the black and white , I guess , it just does not look funky enough .
9707	0	a	The LCD .
9708	0	a	Yeah .
9709	0	a	No .
9710	0	a	but , I mean , like even mobile phones or whatever have now have colour LCD screens ,
9711	0	a	w I ju
9712	0	a	I mean
9713	0	a	I would not know about the costs of them .
9714	0	a	Yeah .
9715	0	a	S
9716	0	a	Uh huh .
9717	0	a	But price price not withstanding , is it too complicated , is it going to be too much just overload ?
9718	0	a	But but the thing is when you use a remote control , you never look at it ,
9719	0	a	right ?
9720	0	a	You are looking at the TV
9721	0	a	and and it is
9722	0	a	It just seems kind of like a a needless th
9723	1	a	So which vegetable ?
9724	0	a	Okay .
9725	0	a	Twelve fifty .
9726	0	a	And the
9727	0	a	i it will be easy because there will be , on LCD s screen , there will be different frent icons , they can just click ok
9728	0	a	okay ,
9729	0	a	whatever they wa
9730	0	a	yeah .
9731	0	a	Yeah , that is the thing ,
9732	0	a	because
9733	0	a	Yeah .
9734	0	a	Possibly .
9735	0	a	Yeah .
9736	0	a	Yeah .
9737	0	a	That is true , yeah .
9738	0	a	And one of the survey findings was that they want it easy to use , so I think I am not sure about the LCD .
9739	0	a	Right .
9740	0	a	It is a it is great , it is a good idea , but for our budget and for the thing we are trying to go for eas easy to use , it is not the thing we should go for , I think .
9741	0	a	Child friendly
9742	0	a	, I thought this was good ,
9743	0	a	as you pointed out the the bit , it often goes missing especially with children ,
9744	0	a	but it is a good shape
9745	0	a	and the organic is kind of
9746	1	a	we could make a vegetabley kind of round shape , I think .
9747	0	a	Yeah .
9748	0	a	Well I mean we could make a
9749	0	a	Yeah .
9750	1	a	Yeah , I know , carrot .
9751	0	a	Well , si since we are going for the the k the sort of company colours , I think your lemon was not that far
9752	0	a	s
9753	0	a	And if it does not work you know , we have just made a lemon .
9754	0	a	The the lemon .
9755	0	a	Yeah .
9756	1	a	Well what are the options ?
9757	0	a	Oh .
9758	0	a	But we do not want it to be
9759	0	a	Yeah .
9760	0	a	the child friendly , yeah .
9761	0	a	Easy to use , it seems quite easy to use .
9762	0	a	I like the d the different shapes of the buttons and stuff .
9763	0	a	I think that is a good idea to go for .
9764	0	a	I like I like the colourful buttons as well .
9765	0	a	Yeah .
9766	0	a	And the mouse one , I thought it was a good idea ,
9767	0	a	because people use mo mice mouses now with the scrolling thing .
9768	0	a	Yeah .
9769	0	a	I mean we are marketing to
9770	0	a	sort of twenty five to thirty five , so most people will have come in contact with that kind of use .
9771	0	a	Yeah .
9772	0	a	S
9773	0	a	yeah .
9774	0	a	So they would be able to use that ,
9775	0	a	as I said I think i I would presume it would come up on the screen .
9776	0	a	Yeah .
9777	0	a	so there you go .
9778	0	a	And that means tha that means you get to bump that bit to the TV maker , so
9779	0	a	Kay .
9780	0	a	Yeah .
9781	0	a	So that is the user interface design .
9782	1	a	So okay , I will take this out now then .
9783	0	a	Okay .
9784	0	a	so
9785	0	a	I guess there are a lot of options that we are going to have to choose from among ,
9786	1	a	and I will I will give you the , I guess , technical considerations for those .
9787	0	a	There you go .
9788	0	a	Yeah , looks like it .
9789	0	a	Yeah , I was just thinking the self same thing .
9790	1	a	And I am going to use the whiteboard ,
9791	0	a	just cause we have not used it .
9792	0	a	Right .
9793	0	a	So ,
9794	1	a	the way I am going to do this is we are going to take a look at some old remote controls , see how they work , reuse the the vital kind of essential pieces of it , and then we will throw in our new innovations and keep it all within budget .
9795	0	a	So yeah , looking inside a a very simple remote control .
9796	0	a	Magic man .
9797	0	a	this is what they sent me .
9798	0	a	Kay .
9799	0	a	Here is the competition , I suppose .
9800	0	a	you open it up , there is a circuit board inside , and there is a a chip , a processor , the TA one one eight three five , which receives input from the buttons ,
9801	0	a	and ch
9802	0	a	Right ,
9803	0	a	it is very
9804	0	a	they are very cheap remote .
9805	0	a	So this is a standard off the shelf kind of a chip , is it ?
9806	0	a	Right .
9807	0	a	This remote costs nothing , you know .
9808	0	a	so that takes a signals from the buttons and translates it into a sequence of pulses that it then sends to the to the amplifier , which is made of some transistors and amplifiers , op amps , and then that gets sent to the to the LED light , which I can kind of see is that little red light bulb at the end , and that sends out the infrared light signal to the television .
9809	0	a	Oh here it is .
9810	0	a	so this is kind of the the bear essentials that we need to have in our remote control ,
9811	0	a	because it it defines the
9812	0	a	R
9813	0	a	no
9814	0	a	, I mean this is a very old one , so now with the new technology
9815	0	a	this is a a minimally small and cheap thing to make .
9816	0	a	Okay .
9817	0	a	So can we make them to pretty much any size we like or is there a minimum or ?
9818	0	a	They gotta be
9819	0	a	Almost a key ring .
9820	0	a	Right .
9821	0	a	So this is what we need to have for certain .
9822	0	a	Okay .
9823	0	a	So you know , as we said , we got the outer casing ,
9824	1	a	which we have to decide , you know , what is it going to be ,
9825	0	a	the board we have to use basically the same set up , processor , we will probably use the more advanced processor than they had , amplifier and transmitter are all standard .
9826	0	a	so for the casing , this an e mail I got from our manufacturing team , you know , we have a bunch of options from wood , titanium , rubber , plastic , whatnot , latex , double curved , curved .
9827	0	a	So lots of choices ,
9828	1	a	what do we think ?
9829	0	a	or sponge , I guess , is not on there , right .
9830	0	a	Kay .
9831	0	a	Well .
9832	0	a	Organic sponge .
9833	0	a	Well , I mean like la latex has a kind of spongy feeling to it ,
9834	0	a	does not it .
9835	0	a	I am not sure about the sponge .
9836	0	a	Yeah .
9837	0	a	yeah , it is very elasticy for sure .
9838	0	a	Yeah .
9839	0	a	And that would k also give it kind of durability
9840	0	a	and
9841	0	a	and ther that is also f sorta relatively cheap to cast .
9842	0	a	Yeah .
9843	0	a	Yeah
9844	0	a	so
9845	0	a	Okay so , here are a a plastic , latex
9846	0	a	Oh right .
9847	1	a	so maybe s a sort of plastic initial plastic with a a latex kind of sheath ?
9848	0	a	Oh right
9849	0	a	, okay .
9850	0	a	I like the rubber
9851	0	a	, the stress balls , I think , you know , that could be a bit of a gimmick like it is good to hold
9852	0	a	and
9853	0	a	Yeah .
9854	0	a	I do not know what that stuff is .
9855	0	a	So something with give to it .
9856	0	a	Yeah .
9857	0	a	Okay .
9858	0	a	And that might be quite durable and easy to chuck around .
9859	0	a	And
9860	0	a	and the colour is yellow , right ?
9861	0	a	Yellow , okay .
9862	0	a	Yeah ,
9863	0	a	y yellow incorporated , yeah .
9864	0	a	Or at least incorporating , yeah .
9865	0	a	I mean I forgot
9866	0	a	i
9867	0	a	we are sort of
9868	0	a	I do not know what other standard silver kind of Other parts or
9869	0	a	I think
9870	0	a	Yeah , the buttons w like , cause there is going to be the the cover the the rubber or the plastic casing and then the buttons in probably two different colours
9871	0	a	or i if we are having buttons actually ,
9872	0	a	I don
9873	0	a	Yeah .
9874	0	a	Mm' kay .
9875	0	a	So yellow for the body ,
9876	1	a	and then what colour for the buttons ?
9877	0	a	So multi coloured buttons .
9878	1	a	I quite like the multi coloured buttons myself .
9879	0	a	You do have ones like play could be green or on and off is red , and stuff like that ,
9880	0	a	yeah .
9881	0	a	Yeah
9882	1	a	or yeah a limit maybe even just a limited multi colour
9883	1	a	so it it does not look too childish , perhaps .
9884	0	a	Makes it easy to use .
9885	0	a	Yeah , that is true , because that blue one did look quite hardish .
9886	0	a	Yeah .
9887	0	a	Okay .
9888	0	a	Although I mean this also comes to shape as well .
9889	0	a	I mean if we are going to make it a novel
9890	0	a	I mean double curved sounds good to me if we are talking about sorta ergonomic and easy use , a bit comfier , you know .
9891	0	a	Okay .
9892	0	a	Yeah .
9893	0	a	Yeah .
9894	1	a	kay so the shape we want to go how exactly ?
9895	1	a	Maybe double What about a banana ?
9896	0	a	Yeah ?
9897	1	a	Okay , like we could have a big banana shaped remote control ,
9898	0	a	cause it is yellow fruit ,
9899	0	a	right ?
9900	0	a	Oh i it does not matter which end you point , I guess .
9901	1	a	Like an hour glass kind of figure ,
9902	0	a	is that what you are thinking of ,
9903	0	a	or just like a It is not
9904	0	a	Yeah .
9905	0	a	Yeah it is , yeah , that that would be that is sort of comfortable to hold , easy to hold
9906	0	a	so you do not drop it .
9907	1	a	We could make novelty remote controls .
9908	0	a	Well , yeah ,
9909	0	a	I mean like
9910	0	a	Yeah ,
9911	0	a	yeah .
9912	0	a	and a lemon might be a little hard to grip .
9913	0	a	Yeah .
9914	0	a	But then how would you point it ?
9915	0	a	How would you point it ?
9916	0	a	What
9917	0	a	Yeah .
9918	0	a	Yeah .
9919	1	a	We could have a little LEDs on each end .
9920	0	a	They only cost pennies .
9921	0	a	Yeah , I appreciate this idea , because then this this will help us in our advertisement also and we can relate with fruits and vegetables , the people is choices .
9922	0	a	That what our data shows that ,
9923	0	a	so this w this w
9924	0	a	the fashion trend shows that fruits and vegetables ,
9925	0	a	like people now
9926	0	a	Spongy .
9927	0	a	Huh ?
9928	0	a	y I am
9929	0	a	I am not sure about the banana idea .
9930	0	a	So a spongy banana re Yeah .
9931	0	a	Rubber banana .
9932	0	a	I mean that that th
9933	0	a	does
9934	0	a	it does seem a bit again childish maybe .
9935	0	a	Okay .
9936	0	a	Yeah .
9937	0	a	Okay , okay .
9938	1	a	I think maybe just draw on the kind of fruit and vegetable shape .
9939	0	a	And what else did you say about fashions ?
9940	0	a	What was trendy ?
9941	0	a	And spongy , yeah .
9942	0	a	S
9943	0	a	And sponginess .
9944	0	a	See
9945	1	a	So maybe an an unidentifiable fruit or fiable fruit or vegetable like so it would have a stem perhaps
9946	0	a	and a
9947	1	a	maybe a it would be s axially symmetric .
9948	0	a	Yeah .
9949	0	a	Yeah .
9950	0	a	Maybe , yeah .
9951	0	a	Huh .
9952	0	a	Like what is what is that ,
9953	0	a	I do not even know the name of it , some kind of , you know where it is like looks like a little snowman kind of thing .
9954	0	a	I do not know the name of that .
9955	0	a	So it would look like this kind of .
9956	0	a	Yeah , that is what I was thinking .
9957	0	a	Like a gourd almost , or a squash of some sort ?
9958	0	a	Yeah ,
9959	0	a	and it has a a clear top and bottom
9960	0	a	so y
9961	0	a	so you could say , you know , it transmits from this end .
9962	0	a	Yeah , maybe that is what they are .
9963	0	a	Cause that you can hold it in like the bottom bit
9964	0	a	and
9965	0	a	Yeah .
9966	0	a	Yeah , why the hell not .
9967	0	a	Let is
9968	0	a	that will make us fifty million Euros .
9969	0	a	I do not know .
9970	0	a	What do you guy
9971	0	a	What do you think ?
9972	0	a	No .
9973	0	a	Well ,
9974	0	a	I guess it is kind of dra
9975	1	a	you do not necessarily have to have it sort of clearly identified as a fruit just to have that kind of fruitish shape ,
9976	0	a	yeah ?
9977	1	a	Yeah , we can relate it by advertising or
9978	0	a	Yeah .
9979	0	a	Yeah .
9980	0	a	Yeah .
9981	0	a	Yeah , then only we can relate it with something .
9982	0	a	Yeah .
9983	0	a	Exactly .
9984	0	a	Okay , so double curved , single curved , what do we feel ?
9985	0	a	Okay .
9986	1	a	Or we can do something , we can design two three shapes and we can have a public survey , let the public choose what they want .
9987	0	a	Uh huh .
9988	0	a	There is a good man .
9989	0	a	There is a good idea .
9990	0	a	Okay .
9991	1	a	Okay , I guess , since you are the marketing guy .
9992	1	a	Yeah , sure .
9993	0	a	We will
9994	0	a	Okay , we could do that .
9995	1	a	I will be happy to do that .
9996	0	a	Okay .
9997	1	a	And buttons would , did we say ?
9998	1	a	different shapes of buttons ?
9999	0	a	I l
10000	0	a	I su
10001	1	a	I mean for the specific functions , you know , up and down , play , stop .
10002	0	a	Okay , so
10003	0	a	so buttons .
10004	0	a	They have got , I mean , they have got standard sort of intuitive things that are always used .
10005	0	a	Okay , just like that .
10006	0	a	Yeah .
10007	0	a	That is cool .
10008	0	a	I like it .
10009	0	a	Okay .
10010	0	a	With the scroll wheel or no ?
10011	0	a	Okay
10012	1	a	I could put the microphone here .
10013	0	a	Yeah , what about the scroll wheel and speech recognition ?
10014	0	a	speech recognition , I think ,
10015	0	a	so we need a microphone presumably .
10016	0	a	Okay there is the microphone .
10017	0	a	Yeah .
10018	1	a	Where should I put the microphone ?
10019	1	a	Okay , well we can do some user test with scroll wheels , right ?
10020	0	a	Okay .
10021	0	a	I mean ho h h wel
10022	0	a	are we sure that scroll wheel does give ease of use ?
10023	0	a	Glad , we are not doing this for real .
10024	0	a	Yeah , I am not sure .
10025	0	a	I mean those ideas I saw were just for inspiration , I think .
10026	0	a	yeah ,
10027	0	a	I can
10028	0	a	no I am not sure .
10029	0	a	I couldn
10030	0	a	Yeah .
10031	0	a	Yeah .
10032	0	a	And I think if this this new software for the sound recognition is the microphone
10033	1	a	I would put it sort of sub centrally , so it is
10034	0	a	Yeah .
10035	0	a	Yeah .
10036	0	a	Okay .
10037	1	a	So should the microphone be just anywhere on it or
10038	0	a	Kay there is the mic .
10039	0	a	Yeah .
10040	0	a	So it can be sort of held and w
10041	0	a	We really need really going to need to hold it , if it is going to be voice recognition .
10042	0	a	That is cool .
10043	0	a	n well we can
10044	0	a	Whoops .
10045	0	a	Oops .
10046	1	a	So let is not use the whiteboard any more .
10047	0	a	Yeah .
10048	0	a	Upsidaisy .
10049	0	a	Oops , sorry .
10050	0	a	Okay .
10051	0	a	And so what else was there ?
10052	0	a	the
10053	0	a	What about the glow in the dark thing , the strip around it ?
10054	1	a	Are we just going to leave that ?
10055	0	a	You still like it .
10056	0	a	I s I still like it .
10057	0	a	but that is me .
10058	0	a	Cause we have got the technological innovation with the speech recognition system .
10059	0	a	Right .
10060	0	a	Yes , or maybe it is just going a bit too far .
10061	0	a	I mean we are pushing it probably with funny fruit shapes .
10062	0	a	Cause it could
10063	0	a	Yeah .
10064	0	a	do not want to sort of overkill .
10065	0	a	Especially with yellow .
10066	0	a	I dunno .
10067	0	a	Cause I mean like if we
10068	0	a	I mean how good is the speech recognition thing ?
10069	0	a	Do we want to go for buttons at all ,
10070	1	a	do we want to just have a device that maybe sits and pretends it is a fruit ?
10071	0	a	Yeah ,
10072	0	a	you know , and then you just tal
10073	0	a	I mean like everybody is got fruit bowl in front of the telly .
10074	0	a	Then you put it in the fruit bowl ?
10075	0	a	They can work from a
10076	0	a	You do not have to hold it .
10077	0	a	Yeah .
10078	0	a	I it could even encourage healthier habits for television watchers ,
10079	0	a	you know they have fruits all round them .
10080	0	a	Yeah .
10081	0	a	Yeah .
10082	0	a	Make them make them think of fruit , yeah .
10083	0	a	Now just make sure they do not eat the remote .
10084	0	a	Yeah .
10085	0	a	I mean some
10086	0	a	I
10087	1	a	l like think of a fruit that could sit sort of independently on its own like , I dunno , an apple .
10088	0	a	Yeah , do we need buttons ?
10089	0	a	Then it is just apple so sort of
10090	0	a	, yellow apples though .
10091	0	a	Yeah .
10092	0	a	I quite like the shape .
10093	0	a	I quite like the design of that ,
10094	0	a	cause that could sit on its own and it is quite got a quite steady base .
10095	0	a	Yeah .
10096	0	a	Okay ,
10097	0	a	yeah , that is good .
10098	0	a	Groovy .
10099	0	a	Okay .
10100	0	a	and as we say we n we do not want to be too ridiculous with the fruit things you know .
10101	0	a	But yeah
10102	0	a	But yeah , about the speech thing , it does not have to be hand held or close .
10103	0	a	Yeah , .
10104	0	a	It can sit at a distance and pick it up still .
10105	0	a	Yeah .
10106	0	a	Okay .
10107	0	a	So I mean like you could actually
10108	0	a	Yeah , gives you the options .
10109	0	a	Or we can
10110	1	a	we can do one thing , we can just have a remote control and casings of different different shapes , different fruit shapes in such a way that a any casing can be could be fit into this mobile general piece .
10111	1	a	So whatever people want , like if somebody want it in banana shape , we will put that casing onto that mobile phone , okay ,
10112	0	a	it will look l
10113	0	a	yeah .
10114	0	a	So a selection of casings .
10115	0	a	Yeah ,
10116	0	a	cause you said about disposable ,
10117	0	a	did not you ?
10118	0	a	You said about disposable earli people want disposable things
10119	1	a	so we could do that , like have a choice .
10120	0	a	In that w
10121	0	a	S s sorry ?
10122	0	a	like if this is a like if this is a mobile phone we will design casing in such a way like half of , we need not to have a full cover , we will just have a half of cover ,
10123	0	a	okay ?
10124	0	a	If somebody wants it i in banana shape , we will fit banana shape casing onto that , so it will give a banana shape look .
10125	0	a	It kind of fi it fits with f fits with marketing
10126	0	a	Like like mobiles ,
10127	0	a	yeah .
10128	0	a	Yeah .
10129	0	a	Yeah .
10130	0	a	If somebody wanted in apple shape we will design that , we will put we will put apple shape casing on that .
10131	0	a	It will give apple shape look .
10132	0	a	Okay .
10133	0	a	So in that way you can have any , that means whatever you want ,
10134	0	a	without yeah .
10135	0	a	Okay .
10136	0	a	We still need the buttons in the same places thought ,
10137	0	a	do not we ?
10138	0	a	Oh , that is the other side .
10139	0	a	Yeah ,
10140	0	a	button will be on the upper side , buttons will be the on the upper side .
10141	0	a	You can standardise those ,
10142	0	a	I mean .
10143	0	a	Yeah , buttons will be on the upper side , lower side we will just put the casing , so half of that will be look the Yeah , not not the upper side .
10144	0	a	Oh , okay .
10145	0	a	Oh , half a fruit .
10146	0	a	Oh , okay , okay .
10147	0	a	So from lower you can ,
10148	0	a	it means while you are holding of from this side
10149	0	a	you c
10150	0	a	you can have banana look or apple look , whatever .
10151	0	a	Okay , okay .
10152	0	a	So in that way we need not to d have different different shape mobiles everything , we will just design casings fruit shape .
10153	0	a	Okay .
10154	0	a	Yeah yeah .
10155	0	a	I think tho I think if you are going to have a facia then you would want to have it so that it does go over the buttons ,
10156	0	a	cause when
10157	0	a	if you think about it if they are wanting it , cause they want to look at it , if they are using it , and what they want to look at is facing away from them .
10158	0	a	And
10159	0	a	Yeah , .
10160	0	a	It does not really
10161	0	a	You know cause that would be in the palm of their hand and they would not be able to see it ,
10162	1	a	unless you have sort of you got the buttons options on one side , and you get the facia on the other side with a microphone so that you can place it face down .
10163	0	a	Yeah .
10164	1	a	And you have got the facia , and you can just talk at the
10165	0	a	Maybe .
10166	0	a	Okay , so
10167	0	a	Yeah ,
10168	0	a	s I guess we decided on material ,
10169	0	a	right ?
10170	0	a	So that that spongy latex rubber everything feel , and the colours we got down ,
10171	1	a	and the shape , maybe we will just make it kind of mix and match type of shape or
10172	0	a	Yeah .
10173	0	a	So you have narrowed it down to half a dozen options .
10174	0	a	Yeah .
10175	0	a	Yeah .
10176	0	a	Yeah .
10177	0	a	Yeah .
10178	0	a	Well , because
10179	0	a	Well , I I am not sure if we should go so far in the whole fruit thing ,
10180	1	a	because I think we should maybe just take the inspiration from the fruit
10181	0	a	and because what
10182	0	a	Yeah ,
10183	0	a	w I think wh wha would
10184	0	a	we are trying to get to twenty five , thirty five year olds who want it quite trendy as well they said .
10185	0	a	Okay ,
10186	1	a	so we stick with what we have got there .
10187	0	a	They wanted something that looks fancy
10188	0	a	and I think maybe fruit could be a bit of a too much of a gimmick ,
10189	1	a	but something ergonomically shaped and organic , like good to hold , based on fruits and natural things like that ,
10190	0	a	because al already we are going a bit gaudy with the yellow , you know .
10191	0	a	kay .
10192	1	a	I mean we could make it nice pale yellow .
10193	0	a	Well , it is kind of gotta be our company is yellow .
10194	0	a	Okay .
10195	0	a	Okay .
10196	0	a	Okay .
10197	1	a	So again I mean like we could have , I mean , we could quite easily have the the main body be a different
10198	0	a	colour , but have
10199	0	a	kind of going round , yeah .
10200	0	a	Yeah .
10201	1	a	Maybe we could have that pale yellow and then an outside bit bright yellow with , you said , the logan the slogan .
10202	0	a	Because
10203	0	a	Yeah .
10204	0	a	I mean e even if
10205	0	a	I mean not necessarily that the the whole body has to be of the company colour ,
10206	0	a	so you know blue and yellow tend to go to we well together .
10207	1	a	So you have the main body blue with the yellow logo and slogan running up one side of it kind of thing .
10208	0	a	Yeah .
10209	0	a	Yeah .
10210	0	a	Uh huh .
10211	0	a	W sort of
10212	0	a	It is I think it is basically the more you move
10213	0	a	i
10214	0	a	it , it is got a wee thing inside that just kind of powers it .
10215	0	a	Great .
10216	0	a	as for the energy source , you know , almost every remote control uses just batteries , but we do not have to be limited by that .
10217	0	a	We can use a hand dynamo .
10218	0	a	I do not know what that means ,
10219	0	a	we crank it ?
10220	0	a	Right , it is like those watches that you c
10221	0	a	So , this might be an idea for something that people really want to grab , you can shake it if it is out of power .
10222	0	a	yeah .
10223	0	a	Oh , a d a dynamo ?
10224	0	a	Yeah .
10225	0	a	Yeah , like with those watches that you kind of twist .
10226	0	a	Yeah , I like that ,
10227	0	a	yeah .
10228	0	a	Yeah .
10229	0	a	Yeah that is quite cool .
10230	0	a	Okay .
10231	0	a	So if it if it is not working , I guess people is natural reaction anyway is to just shake the thing .
10232	0	a	Okay .
10233	0	a	But
10234	0	a	But but do you think that it will be a good idea to use dynamo , tha these type of cells ?
10235	0	a	Because then people have to , well like if the cell is out of bat
10236	0	a	Yeah , to
10237	0	a	mo
10238	0	a	Yeah .
10239	0	a	You shake it and scream at it .
10240	0	a	Yeah .
10241	0	a	Yeah , it is , yeah .
10242	0	a	It does leave them with an obligation to Especially if they want to use it sp specifically as voice activated .
10243	0	a	Yeah ,
10244	0	a	because most of the people
10245	0	a	Yeah .
10246	0	a	Then if it is just sitting on the
10247	0	a	Okay , okay .
10248	0	a	Right .
10249	0	a	Yeah , then they have to pick it up and then activate it
10250	0	a	and then
10251	0	a	Yeah .
10252	0	a	That is true .
10253	0	a	Okay .
10254	0	a	Right what are the other options ?
10255	0	a	Yeah .
10256	0	a	there is solar power .
10257	0	a	, solar power will w also not be a good idea ,
10258	0	a	because then they have to keep m their mobiles outside in solar energy , and the days when there is no sola sunlight
10259	0	a	Yeah .
10260	0	a	Yeah .
10261	0	a	I am I am with Raj on that ,
10262	0	a	I think , you know ,
10263	0	a	I have got I have got no
10264	0	a	I have got a north facing house , there is not really ever sun coming in my window .
10265	0	a	Okay , so probably just
10266	0	a	Yeah .
10267	0	a	What we w
10268	0	a	yeah .
10269	0	a	But w like just normal light ?
10270	0	a	And we are a very environmentally friendly company , are not we as well ?
10271	0	a	Yeah .
10272	1	a	I think we should a rechargeable battery will be a good idea .
10273	0	a	Oh that is true .
10274	0	a	They can they can recharge it .
10275	0	a	I mean I w
10276	0	a	I w
10277	0	a	that idea that I thought just on the basis of like ridding them of batteries and that kind of bother
10278	1	a	is having a ,
10279	0	a	yeah ,
10280	1	a	having a rechargeable stand , so that not only it doubles as a stand , but for using it as recharging it , but also for using it as sound recognition .
10281	0	a	Yeah .
10282	0	a	Yeah .
10283	0	a	Yeah .
10284	0	a	Kay .
10285	0	a	Like like a hand
10286	0	a	like one of those portable phones kind of thing .
10287	0	a	Yeah that kind of thing .
10288	0	a	Yeah , that is
10289	0	a	Yeah , exactly .
10290	0	a	Okay .
10291	1	a	So a rechargeable battery .
10292	0	a	Yeah .
10293	0	a	Yeah .
10294	0	a	Okay .
10295	0	a	Rechargeable .
10296	0	a	the user interface , the buttons , I guess we talked about this already .
10297	0	a	What is chip on print ?
10298	0	a	What is
10299	0	a	Sorry , never mind .
10300	0	a	th the
10301	0	a	the electronics , basically the more features we add
10302	0	a	Oops , this one .
10303	0	a	So the more features we add the fancier chips we need to buy and put in , which adds to the cost as you can expect .
10304	0	a	But I think we can keep it all under budget .
10305	0	a	So yes ,
10306	0	a	so the speech thing you said our our techno our research and development department came up with some break through .
10307	0	a	So just in time .
10308	0	a	Yeah ,
10309	0	a	and if we if we are just having buttons and the speech then we are getting our cheapest option of chipping .
10310	0	a	Just in time .
10311	0	a	Right , right .
10312	0	a	That is good .
10313	0	a	woah .
10314	0	a	Yeah ,
10315	0	a	and keeping the LCD screen out .
10316	0	a	Okay , we are we are
10317	0	a	kind of we are kind of
10318	0	a	Excuse m
10319	0	a	I have just deleted that whole thing .
10320	0	a	we are kind of running out of time ,
10321	1	a	so if you could
10322	0	a	Was that you ?
10323	0	a	that was your bit is covered ,
10324	0	a	I just dele
10325	0	a	I just accidentally deleted what I was supposed to say next .
10326	0	a	Huh ?
10327	0	a	Oh yeah
10328	0	a	that was that was it .
10329	1	a	excuse me , Bri
10330	0	a	You just touch the pad , yeah .
10331	0	a	, yeah .
10332	0	a	So control F eight , right ?
10333	1	a	Try flipping the screen down .
10334	0	a	Oh , yeah .
10335	0	a	Yeah , mine seems to have turned off .
10336	0	a	I ca not do anything .
10337	0	a	And I just touch the pad .
10338	0	a	No .
10339	0	a	No ?
10340	0	a	That is great .
10341	0	a	It is actually shut down .
10342	0	a	It is on , but there is nothing on the screen .
10343	0	a	Okay , now what we have
10344	0	a	our next meeting is in half an hour
10345	1	a	and what I would like you guys to do is work on giving me a model in clay .
10346	0	a	Kay .
10347	0	a	Oh ,
10348	0	a	I get to do it , too .
10349	0	a	Yeah .

10352	0	a	Oh neat .
10353	0	a	Yeah .
10354	0	a	So , you know I mean , luckily we chose a nice simple shape .
10355	0	a	Yeah .
10356	0	a	Yeah ,
10357	0	a	yeah .
10358	0	a	and further instructions will be sent by your personal coaches .
10359	0	a	Okay .
10360	0	a	Okay .
10361	0	a	Save everything to the shared documents , is that right ?
10362	0	a	Oh .
10363	0	a	yeah ,
10364	0	a	I hope I can recover this , cause I have accidentally deleted it .
10365	0	a	Yeah .
10366	0	a	Which does not really help me much .
10367	0	a	I think , I have saved mine already .
10368	1	a	Yeah , can you save that send that last one again , please , Raj ,

10389	0	a	Project Documents is on the desktop .
10390	0	a	Right , that is great .
10391	0	a	But I cou ca not open that , because it w asks for some username or password .

10488	1	a	Will you guys first with your prototype before we get to the good news ?
10489	0	a	we have budget problems .
10490	1	a	Yeah ,
10491	0	a	there is good news ?
10492	0	a	Oh .
10493	0	a	Oh .
10494	0	a	Cutbacks .
10495	0	a	I am afraid you are all sacked .

10498	0	a	Okay , have you got a presentation to make ?
10499	0	a	No .
10500	0	a	Okay .
10501	0	a	No , not mine yet .
10502	0	a	Okay
10503	0	a	so it is just your your show .
10504	0	a	Oh .
10505	1	a	maybe we should bring so that the camera can see .
10506	1	a	Yeah .
10507	0	a	Okay .
10508	0	a	Sure .
10509	0	a	Okay .
10510	0	a	We made three for you .
10511	0	a	Three ?
10512	0	a	Oh .
10513	0	a	one is based on the banana , one is based on the tomato
10514	0	a	and the other one is st
10515	1	a	Look .
10516	0	a	Tomato ?
10517	0	a	What tomato ?
10518	0	a	I do not recall a tomato .
10519	0	a	Oh yeah ,
10520	0	a	well yeah , we had v some red left over .
10521	0	a	So .
10522	0	a	I see , okay .
10523	0	a	Okay ,
10524	0	a	so this is the non to non no buttons one , or as few buttons as possible , mainly speak recognition .
10525	0	a	The yellow there is the
10526	0	a	the slogan , yeah ,
10527	0	a	that we need to incorporate , it is very simple .
10528	0	a	Logo .
10529	0	a	Okay , brilliant .
10530	0	a	If you do need buttons , you can flip it over , and there is some there , but mainly it is speech recognition .
10531	0	a	Okay .
10532	0	a	Okay , so the buttons would be like , you know individual users , or
10533	0	a	Yeah .
10534	0	a	Yeah .
10535	0	a	Yeah and
10536	0	a	yeah they might project things onto the screen which you can do on there .
10537	0	a	Alright , okay .
10538	0	a	I am not sure about that .
10539	0	a	and this one is the one w more like the one w that we looked at earlier .
10540	0	a	Right .
10541	1	a	Yeah , you guys can have a look at that if you want .
10542	0	a	That is groovy .
10543	0	a	Yeah .
10544	0	a	can I have
10545	0	a	Oh sorry s
10546	0	a	Well I like the feel of it , I like the feel of it .
10547	0	a	Yeah , sure .
10548	0	a	that one is
10549	0	a	Oh no , it is delicate .
10550	0	a	At Oh dear .
10551	0	a	That is that is already got its stand that one .
10552	0	a	That is it stand .
10553	0	a	Alright , okay .
10554	0	a	It does also lie flat , but that is the that yellow stand there represents the the charging stand .
10555	0	a	Okay , brilliant .
10556	0	a	the black on the back is the slogan .
10557	0	a	Okay , nice and obvious there , if it is standing up , I guess ,
10558	0	a	yeah .
10559	0	a	yeah , that
10560	0	a	Well , we did think of that .
10561	0	a	Yeah , if it is standing up it is it is on there ,
10562	0	a	but also we are going to have the company name on the front , which is the little black kind of line in the middle .
10563	0	a	Oh right , okay , brilliant .
10564	0	a	Like that from its centre .
10565	0	a	So and that is the transmit the LED thing .
10566	0	a	These are the s two scroll ones which we thought could be channel up and down and volume up and down .
10567	0	a	We n were were not sure about putting them there , because i it is it kind of could get bashed .
10568	0	a	Where you are , yeah , were you are holding it kind of
10569	0	a	Yeah .
10570	0	a	Well , if you hold it ,
10571	1	a	you can you all can hold it ,
10572	0	a	is
10573	0	a	it does actually feel quite ergonomic , if you have got small hands .
10574	0	a	Yeah .
10575	0	a	, obviously I do not think that is real sized .
10576	0	a	Okay .
10577	0	a	It would have to be a bit bigger .
10578	0	a	Yeah , okay .
10579	0	a	Yeah , scale model , yeah .
10580	0	a	Okay .
10581	0	a	that is a speaker at the top , so you can speak into it like a little walkie talkie as well for speak recognition .
10582	0	a	and
10583	0	a	then the buttons .
10584	0	a	Yeah kind of self explanatory , just buttons whenever you need them .
10585	0	a	Tried to keep it simple .
10586	0	a	Oh that is the charging base prongs at the bottom .
10587	0	a	We used those .
10588	0	a	And then the big red button in the middle is the on and off one .
10589	0	a	Alright , excellent .
10590	0	a	It is not in the traditional place , but it is quite an obvious place .
10591	0	a	Okay .
10592	0	a	No .
10593	0	a	It is out of the way as well , I suppose , so .
10594	0	a	Excellent .
10595	0	a	So there we go
10596	0	a	and and we have the banana based one too .
10597	0	a	Oh yeah ,
10598	0	a	yeah .
10599	0	a	Yep .
10600	0	a	This one is , I suppose for the younger audiences .
10601	0	a	Okay , so so Barney the banana .
10602	0	a	A a more friendly type of
10603	0	a	Right , right .
10604	0	a	It is to induce more television watching I suppose or
10605	0	a	Yeah .
10606	0	a	excellent , just what we need .
10607	0	a	Yeah .
10608	0	a	Say it for the camera .
10609	0	a	Lo Sort of Loch Ness banana .
10610	0	a	Right , right .
10611	0	a	Cool
10612	0	a	yeah .
10613	0	a	Well , nice to have options at least .
10614	0	a	Yeah .
10615	0	a	Yep .
10616	0	a	Kay and
10617	0	a	Oh there are issues , oh there are issues .
10618	0	a	So are there any improvements or issues or
10619	0	a	Oh .
10620	0	a	It wo not stand .
10621	1	a	Just let it lie down ,
10622	0	a	it wont stand .
10623	0	a	main problem that we have unfortunately being finance .
10624	0	a	, let is just enter in the evaluation criteria .
10625	0	a	unfortunately the unit we are currently going to produce minus the extra scroll buttons , it is going to cost us fourteen point six Euros .
10626	0	a	Oh .
10627	0	a	So we have to
10628	0	a	rea
10629	0	a	Sorry ,
10630	0	a	I have accidentally highlighted somehow
10631	0	a	What is on the on the left ?
10632	0	a	Okay .
10633	0	a	There we go .
10634	0	a	Oh god ,
10635	0	a	why is it doing that ?
10636	0	a	There we go .
10637	0	a	Ooh .
10638	1	a	So basically , in order to save our two Euros I was thinking that we could have essentially the same shape , but just have it flattened .
10639	0	a	More like a traditional remote control .
10640	0	a	Yeah , I mean it is already got a kind of cool shape ,
10641	1	a	so but it would not have to be curved sort of in and out .
10642	0	a	And by doing so
10643	0	a	Oh no , hold on .
10644	0	a	Does not save us quite as much .
10645	0	a	I do not know what is going on with this again .
10646	0	a	W why is the double curved two of them ?
10647	0	a	Is i
10648	0	a	Oh , good point .
10649	0	a	And double curve on both sides ?
10650	0	a	Curve .
10651	0	a	Yeah , this is double curve ,
10652	0	a	no ?
10653	0	a	This is double curve .
10654	0	a	That is sort of curve in and out .
10655	0	a	It
10656	0	a	This one is single curve .
10657	0	a	Cause this is single curve , this is curved on both sides .
10658	0	a	So double curve .
10659	0	a	No ,
10660	0	a	I think it means double curved as in like a single curve on that bottom half , and the double curved would be if it was that similar curve upward .
10661	0	a	Like an S shape .
10662	0	a	Okay .
10663	0	a	Okay , I might be wrong though .
10664	0	a	Like this , one curve on this side , one curve on that side .
10665	0	a	I do not think that counts as a curve , I think that is just a shape .
10666	0	a	Okay .
10667	0	a	A curvature is like the this case .
10668	0	a	Maybe .
10669	0	a	Okay .
10670	0	a	Cause that is the the biggest expense there , right .
10671	0	a	Yeah , and why why I have got it two ,
10672	0	a	I do not know , I ca not seem to select any more however .
10673	0	a	got two of them
10674	0	a	Okay .
10675	1	a	Well we can work around that Cut things out .
10676	0	a	Right .
10677	0	a	No .
10678	0	a	But you think it should be one .
10679	0	a	It is meant to be one ,
10680	0	a	yeah ,
10681	0	a	I do not know why I put two in there ,
10682	0	a	but
10683	1	a	Hold on till I find it ,
10684	0	a	I think this shift button might be stuck again .
10685	0	a	Okay .
10686	0	a	No maybe the shift button is stuck in .
10687	0	a	Yeah .
10688	0	a	okay , so that would take away three , which would give us
10689	0	a	Oh that is fine .
10690	0	a	Should
10691	1	a	you can do one thing .
10692	0	a	Yeah , so we are
10693	0	a	We should fire the accountants .
10694	0	a	Eleven eleven Euros sixty .
10695	0	a	Cool .
10696	0	a	Cool .
10697	0	a	We cou Oh not quite , have the scroll wheel , unfortunately .
10698	1	a	So we could even add something .
10699	0	a	What ?
10700	0	a	Yeah .
10701	0	a	Fire the accountants .
10702	1	a	yeah , we could add things .
10703	1	a	Maybe if you click back in that bottom right cell , where you are starting from , and then use the arrow keys .
10704	0	a	Does that work ?
10705	0	a	No .
10706	0	a	Yeah , I know , that just extends it as well .
10707	0	a	I do not know .
10708	1	a	You just select one box outsi
10709	0	a	yeah , this box .
10710	1	a	Then move it with the help of this
10711	0	a	Okay .
10712	0	a	It One of the buttons is sticking , I do not know .
10713	0	a	Just just
10714	0	a	Okay , just a minute .
10715	0	a	Okay .
10716	1	a	No input , like this .
10717	0	a	Shift .
10718	0	a	No it is not .
10719	0	a	No , it is cause the the shift button is stuck , or something .
10720	0	a	Yeah , it is not working .
10721	0	a	Is it the other shift button maybe ?
10722	0	a	Did you try both shift buttons ?
10723	0	a	It could be the other side .
10724	0	a	Should we ask Meli
10725	1	a	Should we ask our technical expert Melissa ?
10726	0	a	Yeah .
10727	0	a	No that is fine .
10728	0	a	we have worked out what it would be anyway .
10729	0	a	Yeah .
10730	0	a	Cancel .
10731	0	a	Piss off .
10732	0	a	That is too bad .
10733	0	a	Oh well , never mind .
10734	0	a	Right , so that is finances
10735	0	a	and I dunno what we
10736	1	a	what could we reckon we could add ?
10737	0	a	Well I suppose that is our that is that is our design that we have got .
10738	1	a	Well maybe we could add something ,
10739	0	a	but maybe if
10740	0	a	What do you th
10741	0	a	We are trying to save money , so .
10742	0	a	Yeah , if we are happy with the design there is no point in spending money , if we do not have to .
10743	0	a	So
10744	0	a	Yeah .
10745	1	a	But if there is anything you think we have missed out there , then , you know , feel free to add it .
10746	0	a	Maybe
10747	0	a	I mean obviously it would be bigger
10748	0	a	so there might be more space for the the slogan on the front ,
10749	0	a	because it is not in an ideal place right now .
10750	0	a	Yeah yeah .
10751	0	a	Well that is that is
10752	0	a	Okay , so project evaluation .
10753	0	a	We have under twelve Euros fifty .
10754	0	a	Project process , how do we think that went ?
10755	0	a	Are we happy ?
10756	0	a	Okay .
10757	0	a	Oh .
10758	0	a	Yeah I think we have a a winning product .
10759	0	a	Evaluation .
10760	0	a	Oh we have been writing this up for m months .
10761	0	a	I think it went quite smoothly .
10762	0	a	room for creativity , were we happy with that ?
10763	0	a	No , I mea
10764	0	a	I think it means sort of individually .
10765	0	a	W I think we were very creative .
10766	0	a	Oh right
10767	0	a	, okay .
10768	0	a	Yes , no , maybe ?
10769	0	a	Okay .

10865	0	a	Yeah .
10866	1	a	Oh could you pass the tomato please .
10867	0	a	So .
10868	0	a	Sorry .
10869	0	a	Thank you .
10870	0	a	So now is the final evaluation , final evaluation of the of our product .
10871	0	a	How we are going to means at what standard what standard
10872	0	a	whether it meets our standards or not .
10873	0	a	How mu
10874	0	a	What rating we will give to these products .
10875	0	a	So of course this is will be a team work ,
10876	0	a	w
10877	0	a	we together have to decide wha what rating we will give to this product and everything .
10878	0	a	Okay .
10879	1	a	So what methodology I will tell you on what basis we are going to discuss all this .
10880	0	a	We will give the rating to this product based on the user requirements , whether it meets the user requirements or not , this product .
10881	0	a	Then trends , whether it is as fashion trends or not ?
10882	0	a	Means because we have already stated that people do prefer fashionable things nowadays .
10883	0	a	So this is also an important factor for our evaluation also .
10884	0	a	Then marketing strategy of the company .
10885	0	a	As we have already discussed that our company is quite in the market , not only in terms of providing quality products , not only in pro providing latest technologies , but also in terms of providing environmental s
10886	0	a	Yeah .
10887	0	a	Sorry .
10888	0	a	Sorry ,
10889	1	a	carry on .
10890	0	a	So
10891	0	a	but also in terms of providing environmental safe products ,
10892	0	a	yeah like keeping keeping in mind all the safety issues .
10893	0	a	So
10894	0	a	Now comes the criteria rating with seven point scale .
10895	0	a	Okay .
10896	0	a	I am having this scale this scale ,
10897	1	a	so we have to do it on a board .
10898	0	a	Okay .
10899	0	a	Alright , okay .
10900	0	a	The board working again , is it ?
10901	0	a	the user requirem I think .
10902	0	a	Do we have the the marker for the board ?
10903	0	a	There it is .
10904	0	a	Thank you .
10905	0	a	So .
10906	0	a	So these are the three crite criterias for our evaluation of our product .
10907	0	a	First of all comes user requirement .
10908	0	a	So we will see whether this product meets all user requirements or not .
10909	0	a	I
10910	0	a	I will
10911	0	a	first I would like to have your views , what do you think whether it meets all user requirements or not ?
10912	0	a	S
10913	0	a	So what do you think you will personally give .
10914	0	a	I think
10915	0	a	Yeah , it did .
10916	0	a	It had all the basic buttons that they needed as well as the new technology that people said they wanted .
10917	0	a	Yeah .
10918	0	a	so .
10919	0	a	When the user requirement is essentially just to operate the TV ,
10920	0	a	so yeah ,
10921	0	a	of course we have not actually got a working model yet .
10922	0	a	Does it work ?
10923	0	a	Yeah .
10924	0	a	So .
10925	0	a	I would say seven .
10926	0	a	Seven .
10927	0	a	Seven is good , yeah , is not it ?
10928	0	a	I ca not
10929	0	a	True or false ?
10930	0	a	No sorry tr one is true .
10931	0	a	One , yeah .
10932	0	a	one is means highest ranking ,
10933	0	a	okay .
10934	0	a	Yeah .
10935	0	a	But I think highest ranking is seven ,
10936	0	a	or one ?
10937	0	a	Okay , right right .
10938	0	a	No it is it is
10939	0	a	like true is one end , and false is the oth
10940	0	a	Oh , I will go for a one .
10941	0	a	No that is false .
10942	0	a	Okay , so one .
10943	0	a	So it is one for from your point of view .
10944	0	a	Yep .
10945	0	a	And what do you say our Industrial Expert ?
10946	0	a	d you can you can tell on on the like
10947	0	a	I think she has given her views on the basis of design , because she was our i Interface Expert .
10948	0	a	It is hard to know .
10949	0	a	I
10950	0	a	I give it a two .
10951	0	a	Okay .
10952	1	a	But you can give your views based on technology ,
10953	0	a	whether the technology meets the requirements of the customers or not ?
10954	0	a	Two .
10955	0	a	yeah ,
10956	0	a	I think
10957	0	a	i
10958	0	a	it might even exceed it .
10959	0	a	But I guess there is a kind of a shortage of buttons .
10960	0	a	I am going to give it a two .
10961	0	a	Two .
10962	0	a	And what about you , Brian ?
10963	0	a	You will go for one .
10964	0	a	Basic requirements but of the pro of the project .
10965	0	a	Okay .
10966	0	a	for me personally it is everything fine , it may be having good design , it may be meeting all the requirements of the customers like technology wise , price wise ,
10967	0	a	but there is one thing which limits the customers ,
10968	0	a	like we are having only two , three designs , like we are having one banana design and the other one is orange ,
10969	0	a	and
10970	0	a	yeah , lower end .
10971	0	a	yellow .
10972	0	a	Yeah th Come on that was the tha
10973	0	a	Kay .
10974	0	a	And the third one is what you ge that is not a f fruit look .
10975	0	a	Uh huh .
10976	0	a	But if a person does not like banana , or orange , you are limiting him .
10977	0	a	Uh huh .
10978	0	a	No , do not buy our product , because we are l we like this only .
10979	0	a	Okay .
10980	0	a	So we are showing our preference for particular fruits , two or three kinds rather ,
10981	0	a	and
10982	0	a	Yeah .
10983	0	a	Being fruitist .
10984	0	a	Is that no is that not trends ?
10985	0	a	So .
10986	0	a	no , personally as a Marketing Expert
10987	0	a	I do not believe that ,
10988	0	a	because whatever companies they launch their products in the shape of fruits , they give a range of products , a range of shapes , like if we see , look at the smallest thing , toffee chocolates , they give a variety of different things .
10989	0	a	Some children like to buy banana shape , some apple shape , some even pineapple shape , some orange shape .
10990	0	a	So you can what shape a person will like .
10991	0	a	So in this case giving only one or two choices we are lim limiting our customers .
10992	0	a	And by limiting them , we are limiting our sales , limiting our profit also .
10993	0	a	Uh huh .
10994	0	a	But in electronics , I think , it is not q always quite so you do not always have so many choices as with chocolates .
10995	0	a	I think , you know , if you are going to buy a TV maybe a company will have That you are going to choose from , a company will have two or three choices , but they are different designs .
10996	0	a	We were coming up with one product .
10997	0	a	maybe .
10998	0	a	Okay but I will I will personally wo not give it beyond three .
10999	0	a	No , I mean obviously your opinion ,
11000	0	a	I am just trying to
11001	0	a	Okay .
11002	0	a	So we can
11003	0	a	Yeah , on an average we can think three , four sevenths , maybe .
11004	0	a	He is a tough cookie .
11005	0	a	Three or four ?
11006	0	a	, no sorry ,
11007	0	a	it should be No
11008	0	a	sorry , sorry , sorry , sorry ,
11009	0	a	we are doing a very wrong thing .
11010	0	a	Six .
11011	0	a	Five or six .
11012	0	a	What are we doing ?
11013	0	a	Adding them up ?
11014	0	a	Oh .
11015	0	a	What are we doing ?
11016	0	a	We are going to average them ?
11017	0	a	Okay .
11018	0	a	Yeah ,
11019	0	a	yeah , we are taking everything ,
11020	0	a	and that is
11021	0	a	I have taken it very wrongly .
11022	0	a	So seven fourths .
11023	0	a	Yeah
11024	0	a	three four four two six seven seven sev
11025	0	a	Yeah one pe exactly .
11026	0	a	About one point
11027	0	a	f one point eight .
11028	1	a	So we can say one or two .
11029	0	a	Okay .
11030	0	a	Okay .
11031	1	a	because it is one point eight two , so we will do two .
11032	0	a	Oh I see .
11033	0	a	Yeah round it up to two .
11034	0	a	Yeah .
11035	0	a	Okay , yeah .
11036	0	a	So where were the trends .
11037	0	a	So trends .
11038	0	a	Can you explain what you want us to write there ?
11039	0	a	How it how conforms to the current trends ?
11040	0	a	Kay .
11041	0	a	Sorry ?
11042	0	a	Yeah , again the the fashion trends , this also like whether it it will be fashionable to have these products in the as a fruit shape or something .
11043	0	a	Okay .
11044	0	a	Well going on the specifications that we had , that fruit and vegetables are quite popular , and that people like something that is good to look at and not many buttons , I would give it , well , because it is hard to make a fruit good to look at , that that looks cool , you know , so I would actually give it a three .
11045	0	a	Tha three or four , I am not sure .
11046	0	a	Three .
11047	0	a	Okay .
11048	0	a	Go for three .
11049	0	a	Yeah .
11050	0	a	That is fine .
11051	0	a	Okay .
11052	0	a	As far as the technology it its' got the latest trends in speech technology , but it is missing the screen , as we said , but it does have the push buttons , or the scroll buttons , but it does not have that fancy solar power or the the vibrating energy mechanism .
11053	0	a	So I give it a a four .
11054	0	a	I would give it a kind of middle of the road for for technology .
11055	0	a	Yeah , I am sort of pret
11056	0	a	Just the fruit does me in
11057	0	a	, I mean it might it might be trendy to some , but I am just not swallowing the fruit ,
11058	0	a	so
11059	0	a	also I would have liked to have seen the LCD screen in it .
11060	0	a	Yeah .
11061	0	a	so yeah I would say about four as well .
11062	0	a	personally I wi
11063	0	a	I think that in terms of trends , these products are quite good , like , these products are in fruit shape ,
11064	0	a	because that wha people now
11065	0	a	our fashion trend shows that people like everything all f everything that is being advertised , like clothes , shoes , and everything is being advertised in the form of fruits and vegetables , or getting them or showing some association with them .
11066	0	a	So and in this way our product is good .
11067	0	a	And the second thing , now people do not want any complicated or bulky products and ours is quite simple and quite handy .
11068	0	a	So that is also ef that also
11069	0	a	Our product meets the f the fashion trends of the market .
11070	0	a	And yes .
11071	0	a	It is cus spongy also .
11072	0	a	So they can play with it , it is quite good .
11073	0	a	So then I think , maybe I can give it two .
11074	0	a	So four five ten thirteen thirteen .
11075	0	a	So we can
11076	0	a	Is it fine ?
11077	0	a	So what about company strategy ?
11078	0	a	Okay .
11079	0	a	Yeah .
11080	0	a	Well it was yellow .
11081	0	a	Yeah , the company strategy , okay .
11082	0	a	there was lot of discussing , that was good .
11083	0	a	I feel I got my say .
11084	0	a	so I would give the company strategy a two .
11085	0	a	Well , I think it is the the remote control conforms to the the company strategy .
11086	0	a	Okay .
11087	0	a	Yeah ,
11088	0	a	yeah .
11089	0	a	Is that the question ?
11090	0	a	Is it ?
11091	0	a	Okay .
11092	0	a	Okay , so
11093	0	a	one or two .
11094	0	a	Yeah .
11095	0	a	One .
11096	0	a	Okay , just leave it , it is fine .
11097	0	a	I will go with two .
11098	0	a	So what about you , Brian ?
11099	0	a	Yeah , and me also , like , this product me me me this meets all company strategy
11100	0	a	like our product should be as per customers' requirement , as per latest technology , and it should be environmental safe .
11101	0	a	yeah ,
11102	0	a	a three .
11103	0	a	Pretty much kept to the company strategy , so I would go for a a one , as we not only kept it , but we were limited by Cool , groovy .
11104	0	a	So since our product meets all these requirements , so I would also prefer to give it rank one .
11105	0	a	So four six six
11106	0	a	half .
11107	0	a	So one and a half .
11108	0	a	Yeah , one .
11109	0	a	So we can say two or one
11110	0	a	Okay .
11111	0	a	A two .
11112	0	a	So th seven seven .
11113	0	a	overall we are getting two something ,
11114	1	a	but we can round it as two .
11115	0	a	Yep .
11116	0	a	Okay .
11117	0	a	Yeah .
11118	0	a	So I think overall evaluation of our product is quite good .
11119	0	a	S
11120	0	a	Okay .
11121	0	a	Cool .
11122	1	a	So we can launch it .
11123	1	a	Yeah .
11124	0	a	Brilliant .
11125	0	a	Woo hoo .
11126	0	a	In which case we are done .
11127	0	a	Cause we have evaluated and we are within budget .
11128	0	a	Cool .
11129	0	a	So
11130	0	a	yeah .
11131	0	a	 
11132	0	a	Okay .
11133	0	a	So , this is first meeting of this design project .
11134	1	a	and I like to show you the agenda for the meeting ,
11135	0	a	I do not know if it was sent round to all of you .
11136	0	a	, yeah .
11137	0	a	Maybe not .
11138	0	a	I did not receive it yet .
11139	0	a	Anyway ,
11140	0	a	this is the the plan for today is meeting is firstly just to introduce the project briefly , although I am sure you have actually got some of the information already .
11141	0	a	Then the main purpose is to so that we get to know each other a little bit more .
11142	0	a	then we want to practice using some of the tools that we will be using during the the course of the design project and the meetings , specifically the whiteboard over there .
11143	0	a	then we need to go through the specifics of our project plan
11144	0	a	and discuss
11145	0	a	come up with some preliminary ideas about it .
11146	0	a	And then that is it .
11147	0	a	So we have got twenty five minutes to do that , that is until eleven twenty five .
11148	0	a	S so any any questions ?
11149	0	a	Is i
11150	0	a	not at this point .
11151	0	a	so sh .
11152	0	a	Not at this point .
11153	0	a	So this is our project .
11154	0	a	What we are aiming to do is to create a new remote control for a television .
11155	0	a	we want it to be something original , something trendy and also something user friendly , so it has to be quite intuitive that people are able to use this product .
11156	0	a	The method that we are going to use to complete the project , that has three components as such .
11157	0	a	There is the functional design of the the remote control .
11158	0	a	We are going
11159	0	a	the way we will do that I think is to to work individually initially and then come together for meetings to to work on that .
11160	0	a	similarly with the conceptual design , we will start off by working individually with our own expertise on our own laptops and then we will bring what we have done together .
11161	0	a	and then the detailed design will come after that .
11162	0	a	We will pull it all together .
11163	0	a	I am a bit confused about what is the difference between the functional design and conceptual design ?
11164	0	a	i is it just more detail , as I understand it ?
11165	0	a	Right .
11166	0	a	I think it th w we are talking the the functional design is more your area of things where you will be we want to look at what functions we need in the remote control and what what specific things
11167	0	a	it it has to do
11168	0	a	but the conceptual design is perhaps bigger than that and includes the how people are going to use it and and that kind of thing .
11169	0	a	How how it will be done .
11170	0	a	So
11171	0	a	whe where do we identify the components of our product ?
11172	0	a	I think it is it is in the conceptual design phase that we identify the
11173	0	a	it is in the conceptual design phase that we identify the components of our product ?
11174	0	a	Okay .
11175	0	a	I think we will we will start that initially with the functional design already
11176	0	a	but then
11177	0	a	yeah .
11178	0	a	Okay , so that is just a brief overview of the p the the project itself .
11179	1	a	what I would like us to do now is simultaneously introduce ourselves and start using some of the tools that we are using for for the project ,
11180	0	a	specifically the whiteboard .
11181	0	a	So
11182	1	a	each person in turn , I would like us to go up to the whiteboard ,
11183	0	a	the pen is just underneath it there
11184	1	a	and draw your favourite animal and then tell everyone what the f your favourite characteristics of that animal are and while you are doing that tell us your name , what your role is and perhaps how your animal relates to the role that you are taking in this project .
11185	0	a	Why are you looking at me ?
11186	0	a	Do I have a choice ?
11187	0	a	Okay .
11188	1	a	Would you like to go first ?
11189	0	a	Oh , yeah ,
11190	1	a	p put them in pockets .
11191	0	a	Ooh ooh , things falling everywhere .
11192	0	a	Right , okay .
11193	0	a	Cool .
11194	0	a	You do not have to hurry , we have got plenty of time .
11195	0	a	Okay .
11196	0	a	So , my name is Cat
11197	0	a	and I am really not very good at this whole drawing malarkey
11198	0	a	so
11199	0	a	Okay .
11200	0	a	It is got no eyes .
11201	0	a	Oh , good point .
11202	0	a	, the eyes always ruin it .
11203	0	a	Right .
11204	0	a	Okay , what do it is eyes like ?
11205	0	a	Okay , cool .
11206	0	a	this is a rabbit .
11207	0	a	I thought it might be a cat .
11208	0	a	Yeah
11209	0	a	well origi
11210	0	a	at first I thought it was going to be cat .
11211	0	a	Yeah , I do not think it is furry enough ,
11212	1	a	so we will make it a fluffy rabbit .
11213	0	a	Yeah now I now I understand now , yeah .
11214	0	a	Yeah
11215	0	a	I can see by the ears .
11216	0	a	Yeah .
11217	0	a	Okay , right ,
11218	0	a	it is a fluffy rabbit , blue .
11219	0	a	Rabbits do not come in blue
11220	0	a	but you know .
11221	0	a	okay
11222	0	a	and I like it because it is small
11223	0	a	and it is fluffy .
11224	0	a	And one day you will be able to getical genetically modify them and they will come in pink .
11225	0	a	Okay ?
11226	0	a	I am the
11227	0	a	I need my notebook ,
11228	0	a	ooh
11229	0	a	top banana .
11230	0	a	Excellent ,
11231	0	a	and what is your what is your role within the team ?
11232	0	a	Thank you .
11233	0	a	Okay , cool ,
11234	0	a	I am the Marketing Expert
11235	0	a	so like
11236	0	a	I am going to be doing the apparently according to the little guy in the computer that knows everything the user g requirements specification of the functional design , trend watching in the conceptual design and product evad valuation in the detailed design
11237	0	a	so yeah .
11238	0	a	Okay .
11239	1	a	And more about yourself ,
11240	0	a	you are from ?
11241	0	a	Kay .
11242	0	a	I am from Leicester , second year .
11243	0	a	what else do you want to know ?
11244	0	a	I like sports yeah , aerobics , kickboxing , spinning
11245	0	a	and
11246	0	a	not with rabbits , no no .
11247	0	a	But not with rabbits .
11248	0	a	And vets , I like vets as well .
11249	0	a	And yeah
11250	0	a	and I like cocktails , especially pink ones .
11251	0	a	Okay ?
11252	0	a	Cool .
11253	0	a	Cool .
11254	0	a	Excellent , to match the rabbit .
11255	0	a	Okay .
11256	0	a	so my name is Maarika .
11257	0	a	Where is the pen ?
11258	0	a	Okay .
11259	0	a	There is a an
11260	0	a	if you have not enough room there is an eraser there
11261	0	a	and you can rub it off .
11262	0	a	Yeah , well ,
11263	1	a	or I can make it smaller .
11264	0	a	so
11265	0	a	I am the Interface Designer in this project
11266	0	a	and my favourite animal ,
11267	0	a	I m
11268	0	a	I mean I am not so sure because I am not so so very familiar with all kinds of animals ,
11269	0	a	but I do like dogs .
11270	0	a	Oh , sorry , maybe I should have should not have said it beforehand but
11271	0	a	well , there are different kinds of dogs , but
11272	0	a	okay .
11273	0	a	That is not bad at all .
11274	0	a	it looks like a dog .
11275	0	a	Yep .
11276	0	a	Okay .
11277	0	a	Is a bit more impressive than my rabbit .
11278	0	a	I think it needs four legs if it is going to walk though .
11279	0	a	Yeah ,
11280	0	a	maybe it has some colourful patches , yeah .
11281	0	a	yeah
11282	0	a	and I do like dogs because they are good friends to people
11283	0	a	and they are loyal .
11284	0	a	the other legs are on the other side .
11285	0	a	well that is compared to some other animals like cats .
11286	0	a	they are really much more fun because they are not so independent .
11287	0	a	yeah
11288	0	a	maybe maybe the fact that they protect their home as well ,
11289	0	a	yeah .
11290	0	a	what it has to do with with my role in the project is hard to say .
11291	0	a	I hope to be loyal to the project and not to n not to let people doing similar projects know the details of our project or something , yeah .
11292	0	a	And where where are you from ?
11293	0	a	Estonia .
11294	0	a	I am from Estonia
11295	0	a	, yep .
11296	0	a	so is there anything else you would like to know ?
11297	0	a	Oh , right , my roles ,
11298	0	a	so in the different stages of the design , so at first I will be responsible for for yeah , designing the technical functions of the of the remote control then in the in the conceptual design stage I need to come up with interface concept and then in the last stage I will be responsible for the int infa for the user interface design .
11299	0	a	Okay , that is it .
11300	0	a	Thank you .
11301	0	a	Okay I will do some
11302	1	a	I will rub the features and let the drawing stay .
11303	0	a	Kay
11304	0	a	my name is Gaurav .
11305	0	a	my favourite animal
11306	0	a	one of my favourite animals is a cow .
11307	0	a	I have got no idea how to draw a cow .
11308	0	a	Good luck .
11309	0	a	this is going to be
11310	0	a	Yeah , that will do .
11311	1	a	They are not just like a big round body and then some really skinny legs and then just some horns .
11312	1	a	Okay , so let let me draw the body first .
11313	0	a	Big , round body , really skinny legs
11314	0	a	and they have got a long tail and a long face .
11315	0	a	It is eating .
11316	0	a	It looks like Eeyore .
11317	0	a	And there is some grass there .
11318	0	a	Yeah .
11319	0	a	So this is what I like about cows that they just keeps sitting there eating grass , they do not disturb anybody they are kind of Buddhist in a way .
11320	1	a	Horns , draw some horns .
11321	0	a	So yeah , I like cows .
11322	0	a	my my role in the project is the industrial designer , so I am supposed to design all the details of of the product ho how it works and whatever it will take during the functional role
11323	0	a	, what are the various functions that have to be performed by it during the conceptual design ,
11324	0	a	what are the various components of it
11325	0	a	and finally ,
11326	0	a	I am not too sure what was the last part .
11327	0	a	the detailed design ,
11328	0	a	I I guess it will again be the identification of the components and how they integrate with each other .
11329	0	a	I am from India .
11330	0	a	I am doing my PHD in Psycholinguistics , I sit at the Department of Psychology .
11331	0	a	Yeah .
11332	0	a	Excellent .
11333	0	a	Thank you .
11334	0	a	Thanks .
11335	1	a	Right , now now it is my turn obviously .
11336	0	a	Okay , here is a space .
11337	0	a	That does not look like a cow , does it ?
11338	0	a	No way .
11339	0	a	It looks very very cute .
11340	0	a	Yeah , I like the cow .
11341	0	a	I am Jen .
11342	0	a	Yeah .
11343	0	a	I like dogs too , but I ca not do that already because I ca not draw a dog as well as you can .
11344	0	a	I like
11345	0	a	Is that a lizard ?
11346	0	a	Is there a difference ?
11347	1	a	If you right click on it
11348	1	a	you can
11349	0	a	Yeah , I was looking at the website ,
11350	0	a	and the other things that they have made and I like put down some like inspirational words like that I got from looking at the pictures .
11351	0	a	Wow .
11352	0	a	It is a gecko .
11353	0	a	, a gecko , okay .
11354	0	a	okay .
11355	0	a	Yeah .
11356	0	a	Is a ar are they also like lizards or are they
11357	0	a	yeah , they are .
11358	0	a	They are
11359	0	a	Yeah , they are l
11360	0	a	it is a kind of lizard .
11361	0	a	And I I like geckos because they remind me of warm places and , and where I was living in Cambodia they used to live in my house and they were on the ceiling and they would make little gecko noises in the evening .
11362	0	a	Uh huh .
11363	0	a	I hope you do not like snakes ,
11364	0	a	do you ?
11365	0	a	Okay .
11366	0	a	I do not like snakes .
11367	0	a	I come from Australia and we have nasty snakes .
11368	0	a	That is where I am from , Australia .
11369	0	a	I am from Melbourne
11370	0	a	and I am your Project Manager for today and my role is basically to keep things going and make sure that you all work together in a productive way , so that by the end of the day we come up with a great product .
11371	0	a	Wonderful .
11372	0	a	Okay .
11373	0	a	Thank you .
11374	1	a	So , let is see what is next in the PowerPoint presentation .
11375	0	a	So , I have just thought
11376	0	a	yeah
11377	1	a	I have just thought about this that we could even put it much more professionally as
11378	0	a	there we go .
11379	0	a	Okay , so this is the overall budget for our project .
11380	0	a	We have got
11381	0	a	we are planning to sell these remote controls for
11382	1	a	let is make that go away ,
11383	0	a	that means we have got five minutes .
11384	0	a	we are planning to sell the remote controls for twenty five Euros each .
11385	0	a	and with that we are aiming for a profit of fifty million Euros .
11386	0	a	And that is selling them on the international market , not just in the UK .
11387	0	a	so to do that our finance people estimate that we need production costs of maximum twelve and a half Euro so that we can reach that profit target .
11388	1	a	So that is something to keep in mind while you are designing .
11389	0	a	Okay .
11390	0	a	This is
11391	1	a	let me just skip ahead to see
11392	0	a	that is the last thing ,
11393	0	a	okay .
11394	0	a	We have only got a couple of minutes .
11395	1	a	Does anyone have any first ideas to bounce around about what we are thinking of this remote control ?
11396	0	a	Yep .
11397	1	a	I am just wondering whether whether there is like any special feature that we want to have w want this remote control have as opposed to the already existing ones .
11398	1	a	I think that is probably something that w it is best if we take away with us , but if we all have a think , when we go away from the meeting , what specific things could be included in this remote control that that are out of the ordinary .
11399	0	a	I think i in the beginning one thing was that was mentioned was that it should be trendy , user friendly and original
11400	0	a	so I think your point is relevant as far as the originality is concerned ,
11401	0	a	that we should provide some features that are quite unique to this .
11402	0	a	Something something new .
11403	0	a	So the motto is we put the fashion in electronics
11404	0	a	and so it is something that is sleek and stylish
11405	0	a	but it is still functional , you know ?
11406	0	a	So I am kind of thinking , you know like those phones that they have , the new generation ones , where they do not actually have any buttons on them and stuff like that .
11407	0	a	Uh huh .
11408	0	a	Alright .
11409	1	a	You know , so something heading towards that ,
11410	0	a	so it is not overly
11411	0	a	I mean I do not know what h most of the buttons do on my remote controls , so I figure how many do you need , you know ?
11412	0	a	Okay .
11413	1	a	So perhaps some sort of menu based thing , or
11414	1	a	Something that is a little less crowded than this ,
11415	0	a	like I mean you know , theoretically you can do all kinds of things with your TV , right ?
11416	0	a	But what do most people do ?
11417	0	a	They turn it on , they watch certain specified channels , you know , and then they turn it off again .
11418	0	a	Yeah .
11419	0	a	Yeah .
11420	0	a	Yeah .
11421	0	a	There is a lot of functionality in there that is not used ninety percent of the time , but will be used ten percent of the time ,
11422	0	a	yeah .
11423	0	a	Sometimes they play a movie .
11424	0	a	Yeah ,
11425	0	a	so
11426	0	a	there is no need to have buttons on it to do that ,
11427	0	a	maybe to do
11428	0	a	Yeah .
11429	0	a	Yeah .
11430	0	a	So ,
11431	0	a	no .
11432	0	a	Yep .
11433	1	a	It could be one button for a menu or something , if you really need to go and do that .
11434	0	a	And then use the
11435	0	a	So , if you are the kind of sad case that knows how your remote control works , then you know that is fine and you can do it on the screen rather than everybody else having to have those buttons , which just confuse them .
11436	0	a	Excellent .
11437	0	a	Cause like if you look at the train , it is just very like , there is no extra bits on it , the train on the website
11438	1	a	and I dunno if you can put it up on the thing
11439	0	a	but it is just like a long like thing used for mu moving people ,
11440	0	a	but it looks really pretty too .
11441	0	a	Oh I have not had a look yet ,
11442	0	a	yep .
11443	0	a	Great .
11444	0	a	Any other immediate thoughts before we move along ?
11445	0	a	we can aim for
11446	1	a	I mean we can think about all these little things , but we can aim for something wi that gives a high battery life ,
11447	0	a	although I do not think that it is a huge problem for remote controls anyway , battery life , every now
11448	0	a	and then you need to replace the batteries .
11449	0	a	Yeah .
11450	0	a	Yeah
11451	0	a	but I mean e even though it has to be re original we should not go like too far away from from the usual ones , because otherwise the new users will just have a lot of problems
11452	0	a	with l learning , yeah ,
11453	0	a	yeah .
11454	0	a	Yeah .
11455	0	a	A big learning curve , yeah .
11456	0	a	Yeah .
11457	0	a	So , i it should kind of fit in as well ,
11458	0	a	and the stereotype of a
11459	0	a	yeah .
11460	0	a	It is like those fancy websites that you ca not access because you have no idea how to get in , but the designers thought they were great .
11461	0	a	Okay ,
11462	0	a	so we need to wrap it up now , so that we can go away and get on with some of this .
11463	0	a	we have got another meeting in thirty minutes ,
11464	0	a	so
11465	0	a	you are
11466	0	a	you will be getting specific instructions once you go back to your workspace , but im
11467	0	a	basically you are looking at the working design , you are looking at the technical functions design , and for you it is the user requirements specification , like you said at the start .
11468	0	a	Alright .
11469	0	a	Okay ?
11470	0	a	Thanks for that .
11471	0	a	Okay .
11472	0	a	Thank you .
11473	0	a	I will see you in half an hour .
11474	0	a	Carry the laptops back again .
11475	0	a	Do we need to unplug things ?
11476	0	a	 
11477	0	a	All hooked up .
11478	0	a	Okay , so
11479	0	a	now we are here at the functional design meeting .
11480	0	a	hopefully this meeting I will be doing a little bit less talking
11481	0	a	than I did last time cause this is when you get to show us what you have been doing individually .
11482	0	a	The agenda for the meeting , I put it in the sh shared documents folder .
11483	0	a	I do not know if that meant that you could see it or not .
11484	0	a	Did anyone ?
11485	0	a	No .
11486	0	a	No .
11487	0	a	Oh well .
11488	1	a	I will try and do that for the next meeting as well
11489	0	a	so if you check in there , there is a shared project documents folder .
11490	0	a	and it should be in there .
11491	0	a	wi on on a what ?
11492	0	a	Oh project project documents , yeah ,
11493	0	a	yeah ,
11494	0	a	yeah ,
11495	0	a	okay .
11496	0	a	Project documents , yeah .
11497	1	a	So I will put it in there .
11498	0	a	Oh okay , yeah .
11499	0	a	Is it best if I send you an email maybe , to let you know it is there ?
11500	0	a	Yep .
11501	0	a	Yes , I think so .
11502	1	a	I will do that next time .
11503	1	a	I will act as secretary for this meeting and just take minutes as we go through , and then I will send them to you after the meeting .
11504	0	a	The main the main focus of this meeting is your presentations that you have been preparing during the time , so we will go through each of you one by one .
11505	0	a	then we need to briefly discuss the new project requirements that were sent to us .
11506	0	a	I just sent
11507	0	a	at the last minute ,
11508	0	a	I am sorry about that ,
11509	1	a	but we can see how that affects what you were you were doing .
11510	0	a	Yeah ,
11511	0	a	the last minute , yeah ,
11512	0	a	yeah .
11513	0	a	Yeah .
11514	0	a	and
11515	0	a	then we need to , by the end of the meeting come to some kind of decision on who our target group is going to be and what the functions of the remote control
11516	0	a	that is the
11517	0	a	the main goal is to come up with those two things , target group and functions of the remote control .
11518	0	a	And we have got forty minutes to do that in .
11519	0	a	So
11520	0	a	I would say
11521	0	a	yeah ?
11522	0	a	As who it is that we are going to be trying to sell this thing to ,
11523	0	a	yeah .
11524	0	a	You said targ target groups ,
11525	0	a	what does that mean ?
11526	0	a	okay , kay .
11527	0	a	Okay .
11528	0	a	So are
11529	0	a	Okay .
11530	0	a	So we need to
11531	0	a	yeah , we need to have a fairly defined group that that we want to focus on and then look at the functions of the dem remote control itself .
11532	0	a	So with that I think it is best if I hand over to you .
11533	1	a	Does anyone have a preference for going first ?
11534	0	a	You want to go first ?
11535	0	a	Okay ,
11536	1	a	so we need to unplug my laptop and plug in yours .
11537	0	a	Alright .
11538	1	a	I can go first ,
11539	0	a	yeah .
11540	0	a	I assume we just pull it out ?
11541	1	a	Just before you start , to make it easier , would you three mind emailing me your presentations ?
11542	1	a	Once we you do not have to do it now
11543	1	a	but when once you go back ,
11544	0	a	just so that I do not have to scribble everything down .
11545	0	a	Right .
11546	0	a	so f from the
11547	0	a	Right sure .
11548	0	a	Okay , yeah , afterwards , yeah
11549	0	a	, okay .
11550	0	a	okay .
11551	0	a	So n with with regard to the working design of this remote control I have identified a few basic components of the remote and se from the design , functional design perspective
11552	0	a	w
11553	0	a	I c
11554	0	a	we can now know wha what exactly the components are and how how they work together with each other .
11555	0	a	So
11556	0	a	this is the method that I will mostly be following in my in my role .
11557	0	a	the identification of the components ,
11558	0	a	and since since I am dealing only with the technical aspects , I would need feedback from the marketing person and from the user interface person .
11559	0	a	we will then integrate this into the product design at a technical level and basically update and come up with a new design , so it is a cyclical process .
11560	0	a	Okay , so
11561	0	a	these were the basic findings from today .
11562	0	a	The last three bullets have been integrated from the last minute email .
11563	0	a	I just quickly jotted them down .
11564	0	a	so
11565	0	a	basically the
11566	0	a	as I told you the identification of how the remote control works and what are the various parts to it and what are the different processes and how the parts communicate with each other .
11567	0	a	okay ,
11568	0	a	so e the mee email said that teletext is now outdated , so we need to do away with that functionality of the remote control .
11569	0	a	also the remote control should be used only for television , because incorporating other features makes it more comp complex .
11570	0	a	And the reason why teletext is outdated because of internet and the availability of internet over television .
11571	0	a	How however , our our remote control would only be dealing with the the use for television , in order to keep things simple .
11572	0	a	also the management wants that our design should be unique
11573	0	a	it
11574	0	a	so it should incorporate colour and the slogan that our company has it as its standard .
11575	0	a	Okay , so he he here is a functional overview of the remote control .
11576	0	a	there is basically an energy source at the heart which feeds into the chip and the user interface .
11577	0	a	The user interf interface communicates with the chip ,
11578	1	a	so I will basic go over to the
11579	0	a	Okay .
11580	0	a	So
11581	0	a	if if this is our energy source and this is a cell , it communicates it feeds energy into the into the chip , which basically finds out h how how to do everything .
11582	0	a	There is a user interface here .
11583	0	a	So whe when the user presses a button , it feeds into the chip and the chip then generates a response and takes the response to an infrared terminal ,
11584	0	a	which then
11585	0	a	so the output of the chip is an infrared bit code , which is then communicated to the remote site , which h has an infrared receiver .
11586	0	a	the there can be a bulb here or something to indicate whether the remote is on or communicating .
11587	0	a	so these are the essent
11588	0	a	so a all the functionality of the remote control , whatever new functions that we need to do , make the chip more complicated and bigger , basically .
11589	0	a	Okay .
11590	0	a	so
11591	0	a	i in my personal preferences
11592	0	a	I am hoping that we can ke keep the design as simple and clear as possible .
11593	0	a	This would help us to upgrade our technology at a future point of time .
11594	1	a	And also if we can incorporate the latest features in our chip design , so that our remote control does not become outdated soon
11595	1	a	and it is compatible with mot most televisions .
11596	0	a	That is about it .
11597	0	a	So anything that you would like to know or
11598	0	a	No , I do not have any idea about what each component costs .
11599	0	a	Okay .
11600	0	a	Thanks .
11601	0	a	Do you have any i idea about costs at this point ?
11602	0	a	Br
11603	0	a	Okay .
11604	0	a	yeah .
11605	1	a	Cause that is something to consider , I guess ,
11606	0	a	if we are if we are using more advanced technology , it might increase the price .
11607	0	a	Yeah .
11608	0	a	Certainly , yeah .
11609	0	a	So so tha
11610	0	a	yeah ,
11611	0	a	we definitely need to operate within our constraints , but unfortunately I I do not have any data , so I just identified the functional components for that .
11612	0	a	Yeah .
11613	0	a	That is fine .
11614	0	a	Are there any more questions ,
11615	0	a	or shall we just skip straight to the next one
11616	1	a	and then we can discuss all of them together at the end ?
11617	0	a	Yeah , I think that will do .
11618	1	a	I think we need like some general discussion at the end probably .
11619	0	a	Yeah , okay .
11620	0	a	Yeah .
11621	1	a	Okay , so do you want to
11622	0	a	Yes ,
11623	0	a	shall shall we pull this up ?
11624	0	a	I think that has to come out of there .
11625	1	a	Yeah , I think since since we were discussing some design issues then
11626	1	a	I I
11627	1	a	I would like to continue
11628	0	a	okay ,
11629	0	a	yeah .
11630	0	a	Yeah .
11631	0	a	kay .
11632	0	a	Yeah .
11633	0	a	Thanks .
11634	0	a	Yeah , I thought those last minute things , they are going to hit you the worst .
11635	0	a	Oh i
11636	0	a	Okay , I hope
11637	0	a	wait .
11638	0	a	Should it just
11639	0	a	There is just nothing .
11640	0	a	I it will take some time .
11641	0	a	It ta takes a little
11642	0	a	Oh , and have you
11643	0	a	you need to then also press on yours , function F eight , so the blue function key at the bottom and F eight .
11644	0	a	Oh right , right , right ,
11645	0	a	Okay .
11646	0	a	Nothin
11647	0	a	okay , something is coming up .
11648	0	a	Oh , there it is , yeah .
11649	0	a	Now it is coming ,
11650	0	a	computer no signal .
11651	0	a	It will come up ,
11652	0	a	it
11653	0	a	no signal .
11654	0	a	No signal ?
11655	0	a	Why ?
11656	0	a	Oh .
11657	1	a	Maybe again ?
11658	0	a	Okay , adjusting .
11659	0	a	Yeah
11660	0	a	yeah , it says something now ,
11661	0	a	adjusting
11662	0	a	Okay .
11663	0	a	My my computer went blank now .
11664	0	a	Adjusting .
11665	0	a	But I do not see anything I do not see anything on my computer now .
11666	0	a	There we go , there we go .
11667	0	a	This is the problem , but
11668	0	a	Oh , that is strange .
11669	1	a	Oh , if you press if you press function and that again
11670	0	a	there is there is usually three modes , one where it is only here , one where it is only there , and one where it is both .
11671	0	a	Okay .
11672	1	a	And one more time .
11673	1	a	Okay , so one more time .
11674	0	a	now it is
11675	0	a	okay .
11676	0	a	No ?
11677	0	a	No .
11678	0	a	Should
11679	1	a	yeah just wait for a moment ,
11680	0	a	adjusting .
11681	0	a	Oh okay .
11682	0	a	Okay , that is fine , that is good .
11683	0	a	Okay .
11684	1	a	Okay , let is start from the beginning .
11685	0	a	So I am going to speak about technical functions design just like some some first issues that came up .
11686	0	a	kay ,
11687	0	a	so the method I was adopting at this point , it is not for the for the whole period of the all the project
11688	0	a	but it is just at th at this very moment .
11689	0	a	my method was to look at other remote controls , so mostly just by searching on the web and to see what functionality they used .
11690	0	a	And then after having got this inspiration and having compared what I found on the web just to think about what the de what the user really needs and what what the user might desire as additional functionalities .
11691	0	a	And yeah , and then just to put the main function of the remote control in in words .
11692	0	a	so the findings were that the main function of the remote control is is just sending messages to the television set ,
11693	0	a	so this quite straightforward .
11694	0	a	And w some of the main functions would be switching on , switching off , then the user would like to switch the channel for example just m changing to the next channel to to flip through all all of the possible channels , or then the other possibility would be that she might just want to choose one particular channel , so we would need the numbers .
11695	0	a	And and also the volume is very important .
11696	0	a	I als
11697	1	a	okay .
11698	0	a	Sorry ,
11699	1	a	cou could you go back for a second ?
11700	0	a	switching on off channel , volume ,
11701	0	a	okay , that is great .
11702	0	a	Kay .
11703	0	a	among the findings I found that m m most of the curr presently available remote controls also include other functionalities in their design , like operating a VCR , but they do not seem to be able to deal with DVD players , but then there are surely there are many other functionali functions that could possibly be added to them , but according to the last minute update actually we do not want to have all this complicated functions added to our design .
11704	0	a	So my personal preferences would be to keep the the whole remote control small just like the physical size .
11705	0	a	And then it must be easy to use , so it must follow some conventions like whereabouts you find the on off button and maybe the colour tends to be red or something .
11706	0	a	then
11707	0	a	yeah , the must have buttons would be on off and then the channel numbers and then the one that allows us to go to the next or the previous channel , and then volume has to be there .
11708	0	a	But then other functionalities could be just
11709	1	a	there could be a menu button and you could change things on the screen then , for example brightness and similar functions could be just done through the menu .
11710	0	a	And yeah ,
11711	0	a	the last question I had about whether we wanted to incorporate n more functionalities
11712	0	a	, the answer was already no because of the last minute update .
11713	0	a	So at the for the time being that is that is all .
11714	0	a	If you have questions
11715	0	a	Yeah ,
11716	0	a	and also it is it is other question
11717	0	a	is because there are so many different
11718	0	a	And there are so many different things that could possibly be included because besides video and DVD there are the video CDs and whatever , so it might be problematic to to choose between all these possible things .
11719	0	a	Yeah .
11720	0	a	If
11721	0	a	I mean that was the the directive that came through from management ,
11722	1	a	but if we had a a decent case for that we really think it is important to include video and DVD , I could get back to them and see .
11723	0	a	It is w it is just whether it is worth arguing about .
11724	0	a	Yeah .
11725	0	a	Okay .
11726	0	a	Are there any questions for clarification of Maarika before we go on to the next one ?
11727	0	a	So in the u user interface requirements we we have been able to identify what are the basic buttons that we do want .
11728	0	a	but
11729	1	a	so so at this stage , how we go about implementing those button we will not identify
11730	1	a	or I mean in we can completely do away with buttons and have some kind of a fancy user interface or something like that .
11731	1	a	But is is there any any thoughts on that ?
11732	0	a	Right .
11733	0	a	well , I think the buttons are still kind of the most easy for the user to use ,
11734	1	a	I mean what other options would you have ?
11735	1	a	A little screen or something ,
11736	0	a	but this would be really
11737	0	a	kind of I think a lot of learning for the user and
11738	0	a	and I mean the user just wants to get get a result quickly , not to spend time in like giving several orders I dunno .
11739	0	a	Yeah ,
11740	0	a	and it will make the costs
11741	0	a	yeah .
11742	0	a	Right .
11743	1	a	I think I th I would I would think the put the buttons ,
11744	1	a	but if if you have other proposals .
11745	0	a	I think the co costs will also play a big role when we come to know about them .
11746	1	a	So well we can probably wait until t we have more knowledge on that .
11747	0	a	Yeah .
11748	0	a	Yeah .
11749	1	a	i if the if the costs allow , we can have like an LCD display
11750	0	a	and with
11751	0	a	because we do want something fancy and fashionable as well .
11752	0	a	So yeah ?
11753	0	a	Cool .
11754	0	a	Yep .
11755	0	a	Sure ,
11756	1	a	we can discuss that maybe after the next one .
11757	0	a	Cool .
11758	1	a	Do you want to
11759	0	a	yeah .
11760	1	a	Do you want to give me the little cable thing ?
11761	0	a	Yeah .
11762	0	a	am I going in the right direction ?
11763	0	a	No .
11764	0	a	Wait .
11765	0	a	Okay , here it comes .
11766	0	a	Oh , I am getting hungry .
11767	0	a	Okay , here you are .
11768	0	a	Cool .
11769	0	a	, that is why it wo not meet .
11770	0	a	Okay , cool .
11771	0	a	You set ?
11772	0	a	we need to do the function key thing so that it comes up on here .
11773	0	a	Yep , cool .
11774	0	a	Okay ,
11775	0	a	functional requirements .
11776	0	a	Alright , yeah .
11777	0	a	Hello .
11778	0	a	try to press
11779	0	a	oh , okay ,
11780	0	a	yep .
11781	0	a	Is it plugged in prop
11782	0	a	it is working ?
11783	0	a	Okay .
11784	0	a	It is working .
11785	0	a	Excellent .
11786	0	a	Cool
11787	0	a	, okay .
11788	0	a	So what I have , wh where I have got my information from is a survey where the usability lab observed remote control use with a hundred subjects and then they gave them a questionnaire .
11789	0	a	so it was all about , you know , how people feel about the look and feel of the remote control , you know .
11790	0	a	What is the most annoying things about remote controls and the possibility of speech recognition and LCD screens in remote control .
11791	0	a	Not that they actually gave me any answers on the LCD screens ,
11792	0	a	so I should have taken that bit out ,
11793	0	a	but anyway .
11794	0	a	okay , so .
11795	0	a	What they found is that people do not like how current remote controls are ,
11796	1	a	so you know , definitely you should be looking at something quite different .
11797	0	a	seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly .
11798	0	a	the other twenty five percent have no fashion sense .
11799	0	a	eighty percent of users would spend more to get you know , a nice looking remote control .
11800	0	a	current remote controls , they do not match the user behaviour well , as you will see on the next slide .
11801	0	a	I dunno what zapping is ,
11802	0	a	but
11803	0	a	Oh , right .
11804	0	a	It is switching between channels , sort of randomly going through .
11805	0	a	But you have that little thing that comes up at the bottom and tells you what is on .
11806	0	a	okay , fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons , so that is going back to what , you know , we were saying earlier about , you know , do you need all the buttons on the remote control , they just make it look ugly .
11807	0	a	Right .
11808	0	a	Okay ?
11809	0	a	Cool .
11810	0	a	so this is my little graph thing .
11811	0	a	Ooh , that is a bit difficult to see .
11812	0	a	k
11813	1	a	Okay , well , I can send it to all of you .
11814	1	a	If you explain it to us it will be fine .
11815	0	a	Yeah .
11816	0	a	What it is is
11817	0	a	it is cones , cause I thought they would be more exciting .
11818	0	a	but
11819	0	a	ooh where is it go ?
11820	0	a	Back .
11821	0	a	I liked the , I liked the litt
11822	0	a	ooh come back .
11823	0	a	Oh .
11824	0	a	No .
11825	0	a	Oh yes , cool .
11826	0	a	Okay , I am going to stop playing with the little pointy thing .
11827	0	a	okay , so like
11828	0	a	what it shows is how much things are used relatively and what you can clearly see from that is the thing that is used most is the channel selection .
11829	0	a	Okay .
11830	0	a	What you ca not see is volume selection , it is a little bit higher than all the others .
11831	0	a	that is the next one along , yeah ?
11832	0	a	Yeah , so what the graph shows is that , you know , power , channel selection and volume selection are important , and the rest of them , you know , nobody really uses and so that is the the numbers along the top represent their like their importance , you know ,
11833	0	a	so on a scale of one to ten , how important is that
11834	0	a	and , you know , channel selection and volume selection are absolutely essential , and the power , well it is not quite so essential , apparently , although I do not understand how it could not be ,
11835	1	a	and everything else , I think , you know , you can forget about having those buttons on the remote control ,
11836	0	a	cause they are just not needed , and they are not used .
11837	0	a	Okay .
11838	0	a	This is the bit that the email messed up for me and that is what I was fiddling about with at the beginning of the thing .
11839	0	a	Okay , cool .
11840	0	a	So okay ,
11841	0	a	so this is what people find annoying about remote controls .
11842	0	a	that they get lost , that the you know , they are not intuitive and that they are bad for repetitive strain injury .
11843	0	a	I think if you are watching enough TV to get repetitive strain injury from you know , watching TV , then that is the least of your problems , but you know , it is up there .
11844	0	a	The remote control .
11845	0	a	that yeah .
11846	0	a	Okay , so I mean the the RSI thing would be that , like when you have the computer keyboards and you keep your wrists up would be something that encourages you want something with an ergonomic t design that encourages good use of the remote control and you know , not straining your wrists watching TV .
11847	0	a	Right .
11848	0	a	Yes .
11849	0	a	Okay , cool .
11850	0	a	Right ,
11851	0	a	sorry
11852	0	a	this is pink because I was copying and pasting the table , and I did not have time to white it out again .
11853	0	a	That is alright .
11854	0	a	okay ,
11855	0	a	but that shows how people whether they would pay more for voice recognition software .
11856	0	a	So you can see from that that , you know , younger people to the age of thirty five are quite likely to pay quite a lot more
11857	0	a	f
11858	0	a	well quite are quite likely to pay more for voice recognition software , whereas as people get older , they are a bit more sceptical about it and they are less willing to to try it .
11859	0	a	so clearly voice recognition is something to think about ,
11860	0	a	but you know I d I do wonder how well that would work given that a TV , you know , tends to be people talking
11861	0	a	and , you know , how are you going to stop it from just flipping channels whilst watching TV .
11862	0	a	Right .
11863	0	a	okay ?
11864	0	a	Cool .
11865	0	a	okay ,
11866	0	a	so these are my personal preferences .
11867	0	a	So you have sleek , stylish , sophisticated , you know , so something that is , you know , a bit cool .
11868	0	a	you know , functional , so it is useful , but minimalist .
11869	0	a	there is a there is an important thing that , you know , people use when , you know , when you are filling up your home , you know , a lot of people fill up their home with bits of crap , basically , you know , and you have got all this stuff , and you are just like , what the hell is that , who is ever going to use it ?
11870	0	a	You know , so things should either be functional or beautiful or preferably both ,
11871	1	a	so I think we need to aim for both .
11872	0	a	okay , then a long battery life , like you were talking about earlier and , you know , I was thinking that solar power would be quite cool because , you know , your remote control just sits there ,
11873	1	a	and you could just sit it in the sunshine and save the environment a bit .
11874	0	a	and then like a locator , so
11875	0	a	you know , kind of like you have for a mobile phone or
11876	0	a	not a mobile phone
11877	0	a	Yeah , that is it , you know .
11878	0	a	Some kind of a ring ,
11879	0	a	some
11880	0	a	Right .
11881	0	a	Keys and things like that ,
11882	0	a	yeah .
11883	0	a	Whistle and it screams at you , yeah .
11884	0	a	I know , it is weird .
11885	0	a	My flatmate and I were talking about this on the way into uni this morning
11886	0	a	and I was like I need to get one for everything .
11887	1	a	So yeah , so maybe something where you clap and then it beeps ,
11888	0	a	something
11889	1	a	a kind of sound that you do not often hear on the TV , you know ,
11890	0	a	cause you do not want your remote control beeping every five minutes , cause you you would then deliberately lose it by throwing it out the window or something .
11891	0	a	So okay ?
11892	0	a	Cool .
11893	0	a	That is me .
11894	0	a	That is you , excellent .
11895	0	a	Okay , that is great ,
11896	0	a	thanks .
11897	0	a	that is very good , very interesting .
11898	1	a	I am just going to tick yes .
11899	0	a	So , we have got about ten , fifteen minutes to discuss
11900	0	a	I think one of the very interesting things that came up in Ka Kate Cat Cat is presentation was this this issue of like voice recognition being more popular with younger people .
11901	0	a	Cat is .
11902	0	a	Ca .
11903	1	a	So if we need to have a target group then I think as far as the m motto of our company is concerned , if we want to have something sleek and you know , good looking
11904	1	a	we are better off targeting a younger audience then you know , people who are comparatively elderly .
11905	0	a	Yeah ,
11906	0	a	I mean that is the thing is that it did not say in the survey , you know , whether , you know , these are the people that will pay more for a more stylish remote control , but I am assuming , you know , yes .
11907	0	a	Right .
11908	0	a	Right .
11909	0	a	Bu but but the survey did say that f things like voice recognition are more popular with them , so if you want to put in something stylish , then th it will certainly be more popular with this
11910	0	a	i with the younger people as compared to older people ,
11911	0	a	yeah .
11912	0	a	Yeah .
11913	0	a	Yeah .
11914	0	a	Then again I guess the th where it was most popular was the fifteen to twenty five bracket and the I do not know how often they are buying televisions .
11915	0	a	Right ,
11916	0	a	and
11917	0	a	Right .
11918	0	a	Well , that is when you go to uni , is not it ?
11919	0	a	So , you know
11920	0	a	Yeah .
11921	0	a	Yeah ,
11922	0	a	but you do not have much money , generally .
11923	0	a	Yeah .
11924	0	a	Yeah ,
11925	0	a	you share a television or something that
11926	0	a	yeah .
11927	0	a	I would have thought it is it is more that twenty five to thirty five , when people are really moving out
11928	0	a	and they have got their first job
11929	0	a	and they want their nice toys and
11930	0	a	O oh it is on
11931	0	a	sorry ,
11932	0	a	we unplugged it .
11933	0	a	Right .
11934	1	a	But still , if if you can go back to that slide
11935	0	a	and , how popular was it ?
11936	0	a	Oh , oh , okay .
11937	0	a	Oh , I have unplugged it .
11938	1	a	Do you want me to
11939	0	a	Yeah .
11940	1	a	Here , let me
11941	0	a	Yeah .
11942	0	a	That is alright ,
11943	1	a	if you can just look it up on your computer ,
11944	0	a	wh people between twenty five to thirty five , how popular was
11945	0	a	so it was sti still still quite popular amongst them .
11946	0	a	Seventy six point three percent .
11947	0	a	It was seventy something , yeah
11948	0	a	, yeah .
11949	0	a	Yeah .
11950	0	a	So even they are seventy six percent , is that high amount ?
11951	0	a	Alright .
11952	0	a	Yeah , I kn I mean I know what you are saying about the fifteen to twenty five year olds ,
11953	0	a	but I mean it has been proven that that people of that age group have a higher disposable income because they do not have like
11954	0	a	I mean , you know , if you are at university , you are paying your rent , but you do not have a mortgage , you do not have a life insurance policy , you do not normally have a car ,
11955	0	a	yeah , so .
11956	0	a	Yeah .
11957	0	a	Yeah ,
11958	0	a	they have got no commitments and usually not a car and all of those things .
11959	0	a	Kids .
11960	0	a	Yeah .
11961	0	a	You are still learning to drive actually , so that just costs more than a car ,
11962	0	a	but yeah .
11963	0	a	Yeah .
11964	0	a	So you are more likely to b
11965	0	a	Yeah .
11966	0	a	so
11967	0	a	I mean like it is an age group to target , really , I think .
11968	0	a	Yeah ,
11969	0	a	and if we are if we are talking twenty five Euros as a price , that is not unaffordable , even for young people .
11970	0	a	No ,
11971	0	a	I mean that is what , that is like fifteen Pounds ?
11972	0	a	You know , I think
11973	0	a	Yeah ,
11974	0	a	I d I do not know many people without a TV .
11975	0	a	Yeah .
11976	0	a	Yeah this this is not unaffordable , but the problem is whether people need it , whether they do have a TV to use its full Yeah .
11977	0	a	Yeah .
11978	0	a	Yeah .
11979	0	a	But do they
11980	0	a	But the TVs are often kind of someone is old TV that is
11981	0	a	and be a bit strange to have a fancy rome remote .
11982	0	a	We did not have a TV last year , and everyone thought we were off our heads , you know .
11983	0	a	Common ,
11984	0	a	the students
11985	0	a	yeah ,
11986	0	a	yeah .
11987	0	a	The s the stu
11988	0	a	yeah , and the remote control
11989	0	a	might not
11990	0	a	yeah ,
11991	0	a	it might not even function with the old TV .
11992	0	a	Yeah , I d well we have we have got quite a d decent TV .
11993	0	a	Bu but even even in the case of twenty five to thirty five it is quite popular , right ?
11994	0	a	So are are are
11995	0	a	Yeah ,
11996	0	a	we are still
11997	0	a	yeah .
11998	0	a	Yeah .
11999	0	a	Or w maybe we can just kind of
12000	0	a	Yeah ,
12001	1	a	but at the same time I think maybe we can we can just decide to to have both of these groups as our target ,
12002	0	a	because actually I mean they are all still re young people .
12003	0	a	Yeah .
12004	0	a	I think I think the fact that , you know , ninety one point two percent of fifteen to twenty five year olds are saying yes , I would pay more for a voice recognition remote control , does say quite a lot really .
12005	0	a	Yeah .
12006	0	a	You know , so I mean that and the disposable income
12007	0	a	and I do not think it is something to ignore , you know .
12008	0	a	Yeah .
12009	0	a	Yeah .
12010	0	a	Is not a massive difference , you know .
12011	0	a	Yeah .
12012	1	a	Yeah , if we ta if we take fifteen to thirty five ,
12013	0	a	but that then does imply that we should try and incorporate voice recognition .
12014	0	a	No , do totally .
12015	0	a	Yeah .
12016	0	a	Is that going to have a an implication for the technical specs ?
12017	0	a	I was having a a general outlook on m most like sophisticated features , but voice recognition itself
12018	0	a	I am not very sure about , because one of the p things that Cat pointed out was how do we go about implementing it ?
12019	0	a	and Yeah .
12020	0	a	You do have it in your mobile phone though , do not you ?
12021	0	a	Because you have like
12022	0	a	I mean every mobile phone now has like call this person
12023	0	a	and it calls them .
12024	0	a	Yeah .
12025	0	a	But how frequently do we use it anyway and h ho how good is it ,
12026	0	a	you know voice recognition softwares are still quite
12027	0	a	Yeah .
12028	0	a	Yeah .
12029	0	a	Yeah .
12030	0	a	I do not know .
12031	0	a	Yeah .
12032	0	a	With but with a TV remote it is going to be quite limited if we are t saying the main things people want to do is on off channel five ,
12033	1	a	louder ,
12034	0	a	tha that should be relatively simple .
12035	0	a	An
12036	0	a	Yeah .
12037	0	a	Yeah .
12038	0	a	Right .
12039	0	a	S
12040	0	a	so
12041	1	a	y you would maybe need a code word .
12042	0	a	Right .
12043	0	a	Okay .
12044	0	a	O
12045	0	a	Right .
12046	0	a	Do you know what I mean ?
12047	1	a	So like when you say change , except that is being said quite a lot on TV , so maybe like , you know , remote .
12048	0	a	I mean how often do people say remote on TV ?
12049	0	a	Although I only watch Charmed , so really I would not know
12050	1	a	but like so you would just say remote five , you know , remote ten , remote one two nine .
12051	0	a	Yeah .
12052	0	a	Right .
12053	0	a	Yeah .
12054	0	a	Okay ,
12055	0	a	so it seems like a feasible thing to implement for for a limited
12056	0	a	yeah .
12057	0	a	Yeah .
12058	0	a	Yeah ,
12059	1	a	but maybe if you want to look into that just to just to check .
12060	1	a	, so if we go for the the fifteen to thirty five age group
12061	0	a	and then of course we are going to get th anyone who is older than thirty five who wants to look young and hip and trendy and has the money , then they will they will still go for the same advertising .
12062	0	a	Yeah
12063	0	a	but
12064	0	a	Yeah ,
12065	0	a	yeah sure ,
12066	0	a	yeah ,
12067	0	a	yeah .
12068	0	a	Yeah .
12069	0	a	I do not think there is a lot of voice recognition remote controls .
12070	0	a	Yeah ,
12071	1	a	w well now the v the voice recognition if if it works wonderfully w we could possibly do away with all buttons ,
12072	0	a	but I think this is not really the right moment yet ,
12073	0	a	because people are just so used to buttons and ,
12074	0	a	yeah
12075	0	a	it is it is kind of safer , so we we need both , so the voice recognition would be just an extra , it would not really reduce the size of the remote .
12076	0	a	Yeah ,
12077	0	a	I think we need both .
12078	0	a	W
12079	0	a	What
12080	0	a	Yeah .
12081	0	a	What wh what I was thinking is that there is this separation between what the channels are on TV and how they are numbered on the remote control .
12082	0	a	If we can do with away with that , our product can be really popular
12083	1	a	in the sense that a person can say , I want to watch ITV one instead of saying that I want to go onto channel number forty five .
12084	0	a	Uh huh .
12085	0	a	Yeah , that would be another way to do it .
12086	0	a	Uh huh .
12087	1	a	Yeah , so if if something like that can be incorporated ,
12088	0	a	some kind of
12089	0	a	So that if that was in the the voice recognition , that would be great .
12090	0	a	Yeah , but then the code word would be even more important , because I mean Sky advertise on every channel , do not they , you know ,
12091	0	a	so then it would be you would be watching Charmed , and then the Sky advert would come on and it would change to Sky .
12092	0	a	Yeah .
12093	0	a	Yeah .
12094	0	a	Watch Sky
12095	0	a	and yeah .
12096	0	a	Yeah , yeah , and that would be really annoying .
12097	0	a	Alright .
12098	0	a	Yeah , that is
12099	0	a	Right .
12100	0	a	But that is definitely a possibility .
12101	1	a	Yeah
12102	1	a	but m
12103	1	a	but on the other hand , remote control is not as close to you
12104	1	a	you probably might just just speak into it and and the TV would be already further away , so it might not pick up the other things coming from there .
12105	0	a	Yeah .
12106	0	a	Yeah .
12107	0	a	Do you not think that defeats the object of having voice recognition on a remote control though ?
12108	0	a	Yeah , you know , so you have to have the remote control .
12109	0	a	So that you can yell at it ,
12110	0	a	yeah .
12111	0	a	It is more like if you lost it and it is down the sofa sometime , you can yell at it and it will just change it , you can look for it later , yeah .
12112	0	a	Yeah .
12113	0	a	Alright .
12114	0	a	Yeah ,
12115	0	a	but then the remote control I think I mean
12116	0	a	the idea is kind of it is it is not that it is sitting there on on top of the television , because then you could already yell at the television and you would not you you would not need the remote control , so the remote control is still something you keep n near yourself .
12117	0	a	Yeah ,
12118	0	a	yeah ,
12119	0	a	I suppose nearer to you
12120	0	a	but a b like if you have surround sound then
12121	0	a	Yeah .
12122	0	a	yeah and it might become very difficult from a distance for the television to understand what you are saying because of the noise factor for the remote control
12123	0	a	being cl I mean it will it will .
12124	0	a	Yeah ,
12125	0	a	yeah ,
12126	0	a	yeah .
12127	0	a	Yeah .
12128	0	a	No ,
12129	0	a	but
12130	0	a	I I
12131	0	a	I was just defending the the fact why why we want to keep the remote control close to us , a and not to yell at it from the distance .
12132	0	a	Yeah .
12133	0	a	Yeah .
12134	0	a	Yeah .
12135	0	a	Yeah .
12136	1	a	So wh another thing that can be used is that there can be a beeper button on the TV , so you can go and press that button and and the remote control , wherever it is , it will beep , so we we can probably come to know where it is .
12137	0	a	That is
12138	0	a	but then if you are buying the remote separately ,
12139	1	a	but y you could have something , but
12140	1	a	i if it was something that you could like stick onto the TV or something , some like a two p if you bought it in a two part pack , so one part attaches to the TV .
12141	0	a	Okay .
12142	0	a	Oh yeah ,
12143	0	a	yeah .
12144	0	a	Right ,
12145	0	a	yeah ,
12146	0	a	yeah ,
12147	0	a	yeah .
12148	0	a	Okay , yeah , .
12149	0	a	Yeah , cause it is it is quite important that you do not lose the the bit to locate the remote control .
12150	0	a	The l
12151	0	a	Well that is right ,
12152	0	a	but it solves the problem of having different noises .
12153	0	a	Alright , yeah .
12154	0	a	Yeah , definitely
12155	0	a	, yeah .
12156	0	a	Yeah .
12157	0	a	Okay ,
12158	1	a	I think we are going to have to wrap this up .
12159	1	a	But if we go away with that that kind of general specification in mind that we are looking at fifteen to thirty five year olds , we want it to look simple , but still have the buttons so it is easy to use , but only those key buttons , the major buttons and then one sort of menu one , and then voice recognition included as an option
12160	0	a	but that obviously needs a little bit more working out as to whether it is really feasible and some of those problems we were mentioning .
12161	0	a	The major ones , yeah .
12162	0	a	Right .
12163	0	a	Okay .
12164	0	a	What we have to do now is to go back to our little places , complete our questionnaire and some sort of summarisation , which y you will get immediately by email .
12165	1	a	Send me your presentations so that I can use them to make the minutes ,
12166	0	a	and then we have got a lunch break and after lunch we go back to our own little stations and have thirty minutes more work .
12167	1	a	I will put the minutes in that project documents folder , but I will send you an email when I do it , so that you know .
12168	0	a	So where exactly is this i
12169	0	a	, okay .
12170	0	a	It should be on your desktop , so on the
12171	0	a	yeah .
12172	0	a	Yeah .
12173	0	a	Yeah .
12174	1	a	So I will put it
12175	1	a	I will put them there as soon as I have written them .
12176	0	a	Did you find it ?
12177	0	a	It is just
12178	0	a	yeah ,
12179	0	a	yeah .
12180	0	a	Yeah ,
12181	0	a	yeah
12182	0	a	in that one ,
12183	0	a	right
12184	0	a	yeah .
12185	0	a	Yeah , and email them round .
12186	0	a	Oh , so y you want our PowerPoint presentations in there , hey ?
12187	0	a	Okay .
12188	0	a	Yeah ,
12189	0	a	that would be great .
12190	0	a	Oh so so we will just put them i there ,
12191	0	a	we we
12192	0	a	yeah ,
12193	0	a	w we wo not even okay .
12194	0	a	Oh yeah , put them in there .
12195	0	a	Yeah , then you do not have to email them .
12196	0	a	There you go .
12197	0	a	But is everyone is called functional requirements ?
12198	0	a	Okay , so that is good .
12199	0	a	No , they are all called something slightly different .
12200	0	a	No .
12201	0	a	Technical requirements and something something , yeah .
12202	0	a	Yeah .
12203	0	a	That is me done .
12204	0	a	So , if you put them in there , we will all be able to see them and refer to them if we need to .
12205	0	a	as to where we are going from here , you are going to look at the components concept .
12206	0	a	Right .
12207	0	a	Yeah ?
12208	0	a	Whatever that means .
12209	0	a	Yeah .
12210	0	a	Yeah .
12211	0	a	I guess I will find out .
12212	0	a	You will be looking you will be looking at the user interface concept , on something conceptual and you are watching trends to see how we go
12213	1	a	and surely voice recognition will fall off the map or something that we will keep keep our options op ?
12214	0	a	Components ,
12215	0	a	yeah .
12216	0	a	something conceptual , yeah .
12217	0	a	Wha what was it again that I was supposed to look into ?
12218	0	a	Sorry ,
12219	0	a	but the next meeting are we going to have it right after lunch
12220	0	a	or shall we prepare
12221	0	a	our
12222	0	a	To prepare ,
12223	0	a	okay ,
12224	0	a	yeah , that is good .
12225	0	a	No ,
12226	0	a	we have we have
12227	0	a	after lunch we have thirty minutes to ourselves to prepare ,
12228	0	a	so that is fine ,
12229	0	a	w before lunch we just have to complete the questionnaire and some sort of summary .
12230	0	a	Okay .
12231	0	a	Okay ?
12232	0	a	Right on time .
12233	0	a	Cool .
12234	0	a	Okay ,
12235	0	a	so you can
12236	0	a	 
12237	0	a	Excellent .
12238	0	a	So
12239	0	a	I sent you the agenda , it was on the in the project documents .
12240	0	a	I do not know if you got a chance to just have a look at it .
12241	0	a	Anyway , it is the meeting is going to follow more or less the same structure as last time , so we will go round each of you in turn and you can give your presentations on what you have been up to .
12242	0	a	and at the end of that we need to discuss what you have come up with , so that we can make a decision on the key remote control concepts ,
12243	0	a	so that is
12244	0	a	we need to know about the components' properties , materials , the user interface and any trends that the Marketing Expert has been watching .
12245	0	a	Right .
12246	0	a	Okay .
12247	1	a	, do you want to start again ?
12248	0	a	Let me
12249	0	a	we have got forty minutes .
12250	0	a	Okay .
12251	0	a	Right s
12252	0	a	so I have not made a PowerPoint presentation ,
12253	0	a	yeah ,
12254	1	a	I I thought I will use the whiteboard instead .
12255	0	a	You have not made a PowerPoint , okay .
12256	0	a	, okay , so
12257	0	a	basically I will start off by
12258	0	a	I thought I will use the whiteboard because we have so many different options
12259	1	a	and what we can do is that we can start rubbing off the options that we do not require and putting in the options that are m or highlighting or underlining them or something like that .
12260	0	a	Let is hope the pen holds out .
12261	0	a	Okay , so I will start again with a brief introduction to connect that anyway brief introduction to the insides of a remote control
12262	1	a	and then we can probably discuss the various components .
12263	0	a	Yeah .
12264	1	a	Yeah .
12265	0	a	Okay ,
12266	0	a	so w what you see here is so
12267	0	a	this is the outside of the remote , right ?
12268	0	a	If you open it , you have a circuit board here , right , and this is the chip that I was talking about last time .
12269	0	a	This basically sends information to a tr transistor here , which then sends the information to an LED device here .
12270	0	a	If you flip the printed circuit board , and this is th the most important point here , everything else is kind of
12271	0	a	Okay , so if you flip the circuit board , this is what it looks like .
12272	0	a	So you see for example a particular button attaches to a particular place on the PCB
12273	0	a	and
12274	0	a	on pressing this button I a circuit completes , the information goes to the chip , which is somewhere here and the chip that tra then translates the code into an infra infrared radiation , which goes goes out through there .
12275	0	a	Yeah .
12276	0	a	So the important point that I read over the website was that the configurations of these printed circuit circuit boards are quite cheap to make , you can ge get them printed as you want to , so w we can have a configuration irrespective of the cost , the way we want to have .
12277	0	a	Right ?
12278	0	a	So that is the important point here , so these are the different options that we have .
12279	0	a	Okay .
12280	1	a	So the batteries , I will start with the battery , right ?
12281	0	a	So they can be simple which is like the normal batteries in our the cells ,
12282	0	a	yeah ?
12283	0	a	thes
12284	0	a	these are the kind different kind of batteries that the company makes , right ?
12285	0	a	So .
12286	0	a	Yeah .
12287	0	a	And dynamos .
12288	0	a	yeah ,
12289	0	a	yeah .
12290	0	a	Does that mean like a wind up one ?
12291	0	a	A wind up remote .
12292	0	a	So I do not know if even if you want to consider this ,
12293	0	a	but these are the different things that the company makes ,
12294	0	a	so th they will
12295	0	a	they will
12296	0	a	since they will come internally from the company , they will be eas cheaper , all these options .
12297	0	a	Okay .
12298	0	a	So the third one is the kinetic energy ones .
12299	1	a	You could make the hand dynamo into an exercise bike , and then people could exercise whilst watching TV .
12300	0	a	Yeah .
12301	1	a	And charging their remote ,
12302	0	a	yeah .
12303	0	a	Yeah ,
12304	1	a	and stop worrying about the whole RSI from the remote thing , cause that is just
12305	0	a	Yay .
12306	0	a	Yeah , it is a good option .
12307	0	a	So what was what was this k ka
12308	0	a	Okay .
12309	0	a	The the kinetic energy one is that e they are usually modern watches , since our hand keeps moving , it keeps the watch ticking .
12310	0	a	yeah .
12311	0	a	But I dunno i if it is a good idea for a remote control , because it will just lie there for a long while sometimes .
12312	0	a	For a remote , cause you
12313	0	a	Yeah .
12314	0	a	But as soon as you pick it up it moves and then again it re recharges or something .
12315	0	a	Yeah .
12316	0	a	And the fourth option is the solar cells , which are also made by the company .
12317	0	a	Environment friendly .
12318	1	a	Okay so I will list things
12319	1	a	and then we can come back and discuss what what we think from everybody is perspective .
12320	0	a	Yeah .
12321	0	a	There are different cases that can be provided .
12322	0	a	They can be basically the shape of the cases , they can be flat , they can be curved with one sided curved and one side flat , and they can be curved with on both the sides .
12323	0	a	These are the three options , right ?
12324	0	a	Yeah , would it be flat on both the sides , would be curved from one side , or whatever there were different kind of supplements available , like it can be in plastic , rubber , wood , or titanium , right ?
12325	0	a	Wo wo wood .
12326	0	a	you mean this would be like the the overall shape of the remote control , yeah ,
12327	0	a	Yeah , , .
12328	0	a	Okay .
12329	0	a	Did you say wool ?
12330	0	a	Wood .
12331	0	a	Wood , wood .
12332	0	a	Yeah .
12333	0	a	Oh right .
12334	0	a	A fluffy remote .
12335	0	a	Not wool .
12336	0	a	Yeah , you will understand why when we get to my presenta .
12337	0	a	Oh really ?
12338	0	a	Okay .
12339	0	a	Huh .
12340	0	a	the
12341	0	a	so we can use even a certain titanium is also used in the company to make some space design equipment , so it is kind of it will be probably nicer to use , because it relates to the overall image of the company , but it cannot be used on a double curved surface .
12342	0	a	If we choose this , we cannot use titanium .
12343	0	a	For for these two we can use titanium , wood , rubber , or plastic .
12344	0	a	Yeah ?
12345	0	a	okay ,
12346	0	a	the interface options now .
12347	0	a	So
12348	0	a	we can have push buttons , like most remotes do and our company is an expert in making push buttons .
12349	0	a	Ooh .
12350	0	a	we can have scroll wheels like the ones on mouse pointers
12351	0	a	Yeah ,
12352	0	a	yeah , something like that .
12353	0	a	Sony .
12354	0	a	Sony Ericsson mobile phones has it .
12355	0	a	So , and they have
12356	0	a	they can even have an an integrated push button inside the scrolling thing .
12357	0	a	Okay .
12358	0	a	The scroll plus push .
12359	0	a	So this is something that has been recently developed by the company , in the last decade , so not too recent .
12360	0	a	And LCDs , we can have LCDs .
12361	0	a	So these two are recent and and this is q quite old .
12362	0	a	The various electronic options are
12363	0	a	so th this concerns firs first of all the the chips
12364	0	a	I I showed you at so there is
12365	0	a	there is a chip behind this one , right ?
12366	0	a	The PCB is inexpensive , so we can put put in whatever we want , but the various integrated circuit options are , we have either a simple one or a regular or advanced .
12367	0	a	And the price goes up as we go down , obviously .
12368	0	a	okay , so the good thing about wh wh why why we would want to use advanced u why we might want to use advanced
12369	0	a	is that LCDs can only come with the advanced chip .
12370	0	a	the
12371	0	a	we need regular or advanced for scroll wheels .
12372	0	a	Right ?
12373	0	a	and the chip basically includes the infra infrared sender .
12374	0	a	Yeah .
12375	0	a	besides this in electr under electronics also the company has started making a sample sender , which is did not explained what i what it was ,
12376	0	a	but I am guessing that
12377	0	a	so they have a sample sender and a sample speaker .
12378	0	a	So I am guessing that the sample speaker is probably something like you know , as soon as you press a button , it it give gives you feedback , one five or whatever .
12379	0	a	Yeah , on .
12380	0	a	and
12381	0	a	I dunno whether sample sender sender has to do something with voice recognition or not , but anyway .
12382	0	a	So , these are the different options that we have .
12383	0	a	Okay , so
12384	0	a	th that is that is basically
12385	1	a	now now I think that we can integrate you know , the user interface and the marketing things in that , keep taking out things from this and underlining things that are important , yeah .
12386	0	a	Yeah .
12387	0	a	Excellent .
12388	1	a	Do you want to stay somewhere near the board , so that if we need to
12389	0	a	you can sit down , but just we might need you to leap up .
12390	0	a	Okay .
12391	1	a	Yeah ,
12392	1	a	yeah , sure .
12393	1	a	Sure .
12394	1	a	Yeah .
12395	0	a	What are you , PowerPoint , or
12396	0	a	Okay .
12397	0	a	Okay .
12398	0	a	I have some PowerPoint , yeah .
12399	0	a	Right .
12400	0	a	Oh .
12401	0	a	Do you think these pens can give you cancer of the hand ?
12402	0	a	Some sort of radiation ?
12403	0	a	Yeah .
12404	0	a	Kay .
12405	0	a	No it is got its little camera in there , plug it in .
12406	0	a	Okay .
12407	0	a	Is a
12408	0	a	Ugly .
12409	0	a	Yeah , it should should do it .
12410	0	a	Yeah .
12411	0	a	Right , interface concept .
12412	0	a	Okay .
12413	0	a	to be honest actually , I mentioned some some of the things which which could fit on the on the this talk this time ,
12414	0	a	I m
12415	0	a	I mentioned them already in the previous talk .
12416	0	a	That is fine .
12417	0	a	So yeah , this time I might not have them on the slides
12418	0	a	but I
12419	0	a	I can just mention them aw again .
12420	0	a	Okay .
12421	0	a	So I thought I would also include the definition of user interface so it is the aspects of a of of a computer system or programme which can be seen by the user
12422	0	a	and and which
12423	0	a	the mechanisms that the user uses to control its operation and input data .
12424	0	a	So this would p includes things like shape and size and buttons and voice recognition as well , and colour , and so on .
12425	0	a	the method I employed this time was a again having a look to related products and mainly on the internet and then analyse them from the point of view of user fen friendliness and also whether their appearance was was pleasant .
12426	0	a	and then this this
12427	0	a	this can help us to decide which features we want to incorporate in our product .
12428	0	a	So some findings .
12429	0	a	So in in the case of many user interfaces , they are just so full of buttons that it is actually hard to find the ones you you really want to use
12430	0	a	and and it is just confusing , it takes y know time to learn .
12431	0	a	okay ,
12432	1	a	and I thought I would just quickly show some of them that I found .
12433	0	a	Okay , some of them are here .
12434	0	a	well the picture is not very clear ,
12435	0	a	but as you can see , there are actu
12436	0	a	oi ,
12437	0	a	oh oh
12438	0	a	oh ,
12439	0	a	sorry for that .
12440	0	a	Is go back .
12441	0	a	That is nice one .
12442	0	a	, no , please .
12443	0	a	Okay ,
12444	0	a	so yeah , they are quite big and have many many buttons .
12445	0	a	Actually of the of all these
12446	0	a	I personally p prefer this one , because it is it is the smallest and and with with least with the smallest number of buttons as well .
12447	0	a	And I would say even the appearance of some of them is kind of not so nice .
12448	0	a	okay .
12449	1	a	So let is carry on with this .
12450	0	a	So o other findings some new things used , some of them were mentioned already by our Technical Designer .
12451	0	a	Our own company has developed a new in user interface
12452	0	a	wait ,
12453	0	a	no this is not the one .
12454	0	a	Okay , there is a
12455	0	a	we can include voice recognition
12456	0	a	and it allows
12457	0	a	i it is possible to record eighty different voice samples on it .
12458	0	a	so this this one was already mentioned the LC display .
12459	0	a	It is
12460	0	a	yeah .
12461	0	a	s another new development is a scroll button , which was also th also already mentioned .
12462	0	a	And our own manufacturing division ha has designed a new programmable speech
12463	0	a	sorry
12464	0	a	speaker unit
12465	0	a	I guess it is it should be .
12466	0	a	Yeah .
12467	0	a	and this means that once
12468	0	a	it it
12469	0	a	it comes together with a voice recognition , but it is once once the gadget recognises the voice of the speaker
12470	0	a	, there can be a pre programmed answer , for example , you can pick up the remote control and say something to it like hello
12471	0	a	and it says some hello and your name or whatever .
12472	0	a	Uh huh , hi
12473	0	a	yeah .
12474	0	a	So I mean this is also one of the n dev new developments which we might consider if we wanted to include .
12475	0	a	sorry ,
12476	1	a	can you go back for a second ?
12477	0	a	are you sure wha what this means , a spinning wheel with the LC display ?
12478	0	a	oh yeah are th
12479	0	a	Oh okay ,
12480	0	a	the iPod thing ,
12481	0	a	yeah .
12482	0	a	It is like the like you said , no ?
12483	0	a	The scroll scroll wheel .
12484	0	a	Yeah , you ca not
12485	0	a	Oh , it is like the iPod .
12486	0	a	No no ,
12487	0	a	the scroll button is a different thing .
12488	0	a	I I have a picture if you just a moment ,
12489	1	a	I will I will show you .
12490	0	a	I was not completely sure myself , but I think it is just like it is it is a wheel , it is like not separate buttons .
12491	0	a	Look , this one here .
12492	0	a	But I am I am not really sure whether whether you can really turn it round ,
12493	1	a	it is like you press this or this or
12494	0	a	Uh huh .
12495	0	a	G
12496	0	a	yeah ,
12497	0	a	no , you can .
12498	0	a	it is the iPod kind of
12499	0	a	Alright , right .
12500	0	a	It is like it is like where you you know how you have your your mouse , and y you go round
12501	0	a	and
12502	0	a	i it is kind of like that
12503	0	a	and you spin round
12504	0	a	and it
12505	0	a	yeah .
12506	0	a	Uh huh .
12507	0	a	Okay , okay .
12508	0	a	So instead of going down you just spin
12509	0	a	yeah ,
12510	0	a	yeah .
12511	0	a	It is
12512	0	a	You just go round and it is a bit weird at first , but it is actually very like fast .
12513	0	a	Uh huh .
12514	0	a	I like the the wheels that click on the side you
12515	0	a	you get them much slower , so it is quite good if you like searching quite a lot of stuff .
12516	0	a	Right .
12517	0	a	Do you know , if you are lookin if you are th scrolling through the A to Z of your music and you are looking for something at T , then it is a lot faster than the wheel , but you have got a lot less control over it .
12518	0	a	Right .
12519	1	a	So maybe I should include that here as well ,
12520	0	a	LCDs plus spinning .
12521	0	a	Yeah .
12522	0	a	Okay , and the personal preferences are pretty much the same as as as last time .
12523	0	a	Yeah .
12524	0	a	It it has to be small , simple .
12525	0	a	Okay , we decided to include voice recognition , so to have the standard major buttons like on , off , ch the channels and and then volume and then the rest would be a menu on the screen .
12526	0	a	and I I also thought if we want to keep it small and nice
12527	0	a	and actually I
12528	0	a	I quite like the idea of a scroll a scrolling button ,
12529	0	a	I thought it could be for for voice like ,
12530	0	a	I dunno , it like on a i
12531	0	a	like it used to be on Walkmans or something .
12532	0	a	There is I think there is no reason why we could not use something like this for for the remote control .
12533	0	a	So yeah , that is that is it .
12534	0	a	Excellent .
12535	0	a	Okay , straight to trends , and then we can discuss it all at once .
12536	0	a	Right .
12537	0	a	Okay , I have put the copy of the presentation in the
12538	0	a	yeah .
12539	0	a	The project documents .
12540	0	a	Excellent .
12541	1	a	If you two could both do that as well , in case we need to refer to it .
12542	0	a	Cool .
12543	0	a	Here it comes .
12544	0	a	Okay .
12545	0	a	Fabulous .
12546	0	a	Okay , cool .
12547	0	a	so what I did was to search the internet to come up with market trends and you know what users are going to be wanting in the the near future .
12548	0	a	Okay .
12549	0	a	Right .
12550	0	a	Now , the first aspect is apparently twice as important as the second aspect , which is twice as important as the third a aspect .
12551	0	a	Okay .
12552	0	a	So , I mean the the easy to use thing is fairly low down on the which I think given the target group is what you would expect , really .
12553	0	a	, you know , people want something new , something technologically innovative and different , so the whole idea with the LCDs and the spinning and the colours and the voice recognition is quite like , quite the thing to go for .
12554	0	a	Okay .
12555	0	a	And , yeah it wants to look fancy , fancy look and feel .
12556	1	a	So maybe as you are discussing things , is it okay if we just keep highlighting things here ?
12557	0	a	Right .
12558	0	a	So
12559	0	a	Yeah ,
12560	0	a	yeah .
12561	0	a	Yeah ,
12562	0	a	yeah , sure .
12563	0	a	Yeah .
12564	0	a	So so it
12565	0	a	yeah ,
12566	0	a	so probably voice recognition is is kind of important , right ?
12567	0	a	and an
12568	0	a	yeah .
12569	0	a	That is over on the interface ,
12570	1	a	if if you could put
12571	0	a	Yeah .
12572	1	a	And maybe the LCD and spinning
12573	0	a	so that means we need an advanced thing .
12574	0	a	Okay , I I have a point about LCD ,
12575	0	a	I dunno if it is the right point to take it up .
12576	0	a	W LCDs are basically for feedback , right , to the user who is pressing buttons , and the feedback can come through television itself ,
12577	0	a	so do we need an LCD on the remote ?
12578	0	a	Depends how fast your television runs , really ,
12579	0	a	do not do not you think ?
12580	0	a	I mean we have got one of those Telewest boxes and you put the number in the remote
12581	0	a	and then you wait
12582	0	a	and then it goes to the TV
12583	0	a	and then you wait ,
12584	0	a	and then it comes , so i it actually takes quite a long time .
12585	0	a	And if you get the number in wrong , then it is a bit of a pain , so I think , you know , a screen on the remote would probably cut down your time on that .
12586	0	a	Right .
12587	0	a	But like remotes do tend to get f thrown about a bit .
12588	0	a	Right .
12589	0	a	It it is also quite nice though to to have something here
12590	0	a	so you do not interrupt the picture on the screen , so if you are watching something
12591	0	a	Yeah .
12592	0	a	You know ?
12593	0	a	Yeah .
12594	0	a	That is true , yeah ,
12595	0	a	that is also
12596	0	a	Right .
12597	0	a	And i it would be like
12598	1	a	I mean if you could make it integrate with the TV then it could come up with new information about what is on , and you could just see that on the remote rather than
12599	0	a	Yeah .
12600	0	a	Rather than having to interrupt your viewing pleasure .
12601	1	a	But I think maybe a way to do it would be a similar way to how you have your mobile phone , you know ,
12602	0	a	like you have the slidey ones and you have the flippy ones and then the screen is protected so it does not actually get scratched .
12603	1	a	So you can have like what looks like a normal remote control , you know or like a minimalist remote control .
12604	0	a	Yeah .
12605	0	a	So you got your buttons one to nine , your on and off and your volume on that
12606	1	a	and then if you want to mess about with it , you flip it open and ,
12607	0	a	yeah .
12608	0	a	right .
12609	1	a	And then you can flip it open .
12610	0	a	Okay .
12611	0	a	So now we seem to have a consensus that LCDs are definitely the way to go because of style and
12612	0	a	Right .
12613	0	a	Yeah , I think so .
12614	0	a	Yeah ,
12615	0	a	so that kind of decides your whole chip thing .
12616	0	a	Yeah .
12617	0	a	You you agree ?
12618	0	a	Maarika ,
12619	0	a	yeah ?
12620	0	a	Yeah .
12621	0	a	Yep
12622	0	a	, yeah .
12623	0	a	Right .
12624	0	a	So LCDs , yeah , definitely .
12625	0	a	Okay ?
12626	0	a	Cool .
12627	1	a	Go on .
12628	0	a	Okay , apparently , fruit and vegetables will be providing inspiration .
12629	0	a	Sorry ,
12630	0	a	I discovered clip art .
12631	0	a	so these will be an important feature for clothes , shoes and furniture .
12632	0	a	So I mean , I am taking this to mean , you know , curviness .
12633	0	a	Do you know ?
12634	0	a	Cause you do not tend to get flat vegetables .
12635	0	a	Yeah ,
12636	1	a	and possibly even uneven ,
12637	0	a	like not not symmet
12638	0	a	yeah .
12639	0	a	You know ?
12640	0	a	Yeah ,
12641	1	a	bit of asymmetry and stuff .
12642	0	a	But that would be a good way to to get in the whole RSI issue in there , because I mean if you think most people use the remote control with their right hand ha right hands
12643	0	a	so you want to you curve it so that it is suitable for use with the right hand .
12644	0	a	Right .
12645	0	a	yeah
12646	0	a	, I am not quite sure about the relevance of material will be spongy .
12647	0	a	Yeah ,
12648	0	a	but I mean y you have to
12649	0	a	Well I suppose you would not get a remote an electric shock off your remote control if it was made of rubber .
12650	0	a	Something a bit squishy and
12651	0	a	Yeah ,
12652	0	a	and it would help if you drop it , it protects it as well .
12653	0	a	Yeah ,
12654	0	a	we we have
12655	0	a	we have rubber , but there is a problem that I forgot to discuss with the with using
12656	0	a	So if if we use latex cases , they wo not allow us to use solar cells , as an energy source that is the constraint , so we could use titanium , wood or plastic or
12657	0	a	Yeah ,
12658	0	a	w energy source .
12659	1	a	So it could be like a rubbery
12660	0	a	yeah , uh huh .
12661	0	a	Yeah ,
12662	0	a	yeah .
12663	0	a	To some degree .
12664	0	a	Uh huh .
12665	1	a	Or if we want to use the the latex , then we have to go with one of the other power things .
12666	0	a	If it is made of rubber you could get the kinetic energy fairly easily there , you could just bounce it up and down .
12667	0	a	From from bouncing it .
12668	0	a	Yeah , tap it on the desk , yeah .
12669	1	a	You can have it as like a little ball to bounce , that flips open .
12670	0	a	Yeah .
12671	0	a	so yeah , okay .
12672	1	a	So probably double curved surface is the way to go ,
12673	0	a	yeah , .
12674	0	a	Yeah ,
12675	0	a	yeah .
12676	0	a	yeah .
12677	1	a	Or or curved at one end and flat on the top ,
12678	0	a	because I I am not sure if it is flat on both both the sides , then ho how much easy would it be to reach for buttons , etcetera .
12679	0	a	Yeah .
12680	0	a	You have to have a certain element of flatness , I think .
12681	0	a	It it depends on the whole ergonomics of it , you know , it is like how you put your hands
12682	0	a	so y
12683	0	a	it is the least movement basically .
12684	0	a	Yeah .
12685	0	a	Yeah , singe single side curved or double side curved does not say too much , does it ?
12686	0	a	It
12687	0	a	Uh huh .
12688	0	a	No , I d I do not think it makes a lot of difference .
12689	0	a	I I have one of those s slidey phones and I mean the back is essentially straight , but it is curvy , so .
12690	0	a	Besides , you have four sides to a thing ,
12691	1	a	so I mean does curved one side mean one side is straight and , you know curved two sides means the whole thing is just a big curvy p thing ?
12692	0	a	Yeah .
12693	0	a	Yeah , cause the
12694	0	a	Yeah .
12695	0	a	I think
12696	0	a	Right .
12697	0	a	Right .
12698	0	a	Dunno .
12699	0	a	Di now did it say anywhere in your research material about this sliding stuff
12700	0	a	because according to the information that I have , I think the onl only options that we have with the case is are these three .
12701	0	a	eith either we have a flat surfaced case or a curved surfaced case .
12702	0	a	It does not say anything about whether technically , you know , this this stuff is available at all .
12703	0	a	Nothing to open them .
12704	0	a	Yeah .
12705	0	a	it is it is more about the protecting the LCD , which I think is where it came from .
12706	0	a	Right ,
12707	0	a	yeah ,
12708	0	a	yeah .
12709	0	a	But no , my research did not tell me anything , which is why we have all the pictures , cause I had nothing better to do with my time .
12710	0	a	Right .
12711	0	a	Okay .
12712	0	a	Okay , cool .
12713	0	a	Anything else ?
12714	0	a	What have we got ?
12715	0	a	Okay , so .
12716	0	a	combine style with a level of functionality , beauty and practicality and a thing of beauty and p function .
12717	0	a	Cool , thanks .
12718	0	a	Okay ?
12719	0	a	It is about the practicality of it really , is not it ?
12720	0	a	You know ?
12721	0	a	I mean if
12722	0	a	I ca not imagine a m wooden remote control .
12723	0	a	Thanks
12724	0	a	Yeah uh hum
12725	0	a	yeah .
12726	0	a	Looking at what we have got , we we want an LCD display with a spinning wheel .
12727	0	a	Yeah .
12728	1	a	Let is let is try to r rub off things and
12729	0	a	yeah ,
12730	0	a	so
12731	0	a	hand dynamos are definitely out , right ?
12732	0	a	You you got a wind dynamo , yeah .
12733	0	a	Yeah ,
12734	1	a	rub off some of those .
12735	0	a	Yeah , it is not that is not streamlined and sexy , having a having a wind up .
12736	0	a	Okay .
12737	0	a	kinetic energy does seem to have some kind of appeal ,
12738	0	a	but
12739	0	a	it is
12740	0	a	Yeah .
12741	0	a	I think tha
12742	0	a	Depends how much how much movement it really needs .
12743	0	a	As against a watch , which constantly keeps moving , this this thing will have to be tapped every time , which which might be very frustrating for the user .
12744	0	a	Kinetic energy it needs I do not have too much technical information on that ,
12745	0	a	yeah , right .
12746	0	a	Pr presumably if they are suggesting it , then we could use it .
12747	1	a	Okay , let is keep it option keep an option ,
12748	0	a	yeah .
12749	1	a	I would I would keep it on .
12750	0	a	the flat co completely flat case is definitely out , right ?
12751	0	a	It has to be at least curved from one side , yeah .
12752	0	a	We do not want that it is no it is not not vegetable .
12753	0	a	Yeah
12754	0	a	it is
12755	0	a	yeah .
12756	0	a	okay ,
12757	0	a	we still have all all the options .
12758	0	a	Wood , do you think wood will be a good idea ?
12759	0	a	N wood is I ca not
12760	0	a	n how do you
12761	0	a	I mean you ca not keep it really small
12762	0	a	you ca not make it like thin and
12763	0	a	The wood thing .
12764	0	a	Right .
12765	0	a	Because you need to you n you need to put all the technology in , so I mean if the case you add the case and it it becomes a bit bulky
12766	0	a	wi mm mm
12767	0	a	yeah .
12768	0	a	Yeah
12769	0	a	if if it is really thin if it is really thin it it is likely to break ,
12770	0	a	it is it is much more
12771	0	a	Right .
12772	0	a	Yeah ,
12773	0	a	yeah .
12774	0	a	Yeah ,
12775	0	a	and given that we are we are looking at more spongy material preferences , I ha would think maybe rubber or plastic is more
12776	0	a	Yeah .
12777	0	a	Yeah .
12778	0	a	U
12779	0	a	yeah
12780	0	a	wood is not really
12781	0	a	yeah .
12782	0	a	Well it is not very cleanable either ,
12783	0	a	do you know .
12784	0	a	That is true .
12785	0	a	Yeah .
12786	0	a	It is it is not a practical
12787	0	a	I mean it is it is alright for a table , but for a remote control , you know .
12788	0	a	Yeah .
12789	0	a	And splinters and stuff and It just m does not make any sense , I think is the thing with wood .
12790	0	a	Yeah ,
12791	0	a	okay wood is out .
12792	0	a	Yeah .
12793	0	a	Right .
12794	0	a	Yeah , yeah ,
12795	0	a	in the case of remote control not really .
12796	0	a	Yeah .
12797	0	a	Okay , now for the really interesting stuff , the interface .
12798	0	a	Yeah .
12799	0	a	Right , so the the push buttons is is our expertise in the industry , but it seems to be out of trend , you know ,
12800	0	a	nobody seems to be
12801	0	a	right .
12802	0	a	You have to have some push buttons , do not you ?
12803	0	a	G
12804	0	a	yeah ,
12805	0	a	yeah .
12806	0	a	Yeah , but
12807	0	a	you
12808	1	a	I think for for the channel numb channel numbers you still need them , would not you ?
12809	0	a	Yeah , so for channel numbers but
12810	0	a	But I th
12811	0	a	yeah
12812	0	a	but I think the LCD display is
12813	0	a	kind of yeah ,
12814	0	a	it is faster
12815	0	a	with a m
12816	0	a	yeah and
12817	0	a	w if we dis and
12818	0	a	when we s discussed that we might like this flipping open thing , then I mean y you can use it as a normal remote control , but if you do want to use LCD , then you flip it open , but it is it it is more time consuming .
12819	0	a	Oh , if if we have LCD displays , that opens up a whole world , you know , if you have an LCD display , then you can select almost everything on the LCD display .
12820	0	a	Just for fast
12821	0	a	Yeah .
12822	0	a	Right .
12823	0	a	Okay .
12824	0	a	Yeah .
12825	0	a	Yeah .
12826	0	a	Yeah .
12827	0	a	I think this is going back to the the graph at the beginning that I made , where , you know , the buttons that people use all the time , you want buttons for them and everything else menu driven .
12828	0	a	right .
12829	0	a	Yeah .
12830	0	a	And it
12831	0	a	yeah
12832	0	a	L LCD .
12833	0	a	So in in the buttons we have for the channels also we have options .
12834	1	a	Do you do we enumerate everything from zero to nine ?
12835	1	a	Or do we have just channel plus ,
12836	1	a	channel minus , just to just to scroll ?
12837	0	a	The numbers .
12838	0	a	No , no ,
12839	0	a	I mean we we definitely need the the numbers , because it is otherwise people do not want to flip through all the channels .
12840	0	a	Yeah .
12841	0	a	Yeah .
12842	0	a	Do we need them on as buttons or do we need them as LCD ?
12843	0	a	Buttons .
12844	0	a	Right .
12845	0	a	Yeah ,
12846	0	a	I would say buttons ,
12847	0	a	because it is
12848	0	a	yeah .
12849	0	a	Or
12850	0	a	on the LCD we can , you know
12851	0	a	Okay .
12852	0	a	G
12853	0	a	yeah ,
12854	0	a	I would think buttons ,
12855	0	a	yeah .
12856	0	a	It is it is the
12857	0	a	I think the thing is , so if someone just wants to turn on their TV and put on a channel , then it should be easier to use than any other remote , and then if someone wants to , you know , change the contrast on their TV and they should be able to do that and it should be accessible ,
12858	0	a	but , you know , I mean most of the time
12859	0	a	I mean there is a limit to how much the biggest techno geek can spend fiddling with the TV
12860	0	a	, I think is the the the issue there .
12861	0	a	I
12862	0	a	Yeah .
12863	0	a	So
12864	0	a	Alright .
12865	0	a	Yeah .
12866	0	a	Yeah .
12867	0	a	Right .
12868	0	a	Okay , so buttons definitely in
12869	1	a	but oh shall we try to draw a prec
12870	0	a	okay .
12871	0	a	I think that is what you guys are going to do next ,
12872	1	a	so if we put down the key things that we want .
12873	0	a	Okay , okay , so the components .
12874	0	a	Yeah .
12875	0	a	Right , so what about the the scrolling ?
12876	0	a	I am not sure it will be a good idea to construct the whole thing out of rubber .
12877	0	a	Yeah
12878	0	a	but
12879	0	a	n I I am not completely completely clear
12880	0	a	I
12881	0	a	yeah ,
12882	0	a	about the spinning wheel .
12883	0	a	So I think it it does not make sense to have both like a scrolling and spinning thing ,
12884	0	a	it is
12885	0	a	you can al include everything in the spinning if you
12886	0	a	yeah ,
12887	0	a	yeah ,
12888	0	a	in that case .
12889	0	a	E either or G
12890	0	a	yeah .
12891	0	a	Just spinning and not scrolling , I would say .
12892	0	a	I would say the s the s the spinning goes at a high speed to th to the scrolling wheel , so you have to decide whether you you know , you want to be going so fast or not .
12893	0	a	Yeah .
12894	0	a	But I mean the the thing with this whole if y you are planning on making it out of rubber , on the basis that it is spongy , then I am not sure how well a scrolling wheel would work .
12895	0	a	But if you have got a if if you have got a flipped thing , effectively it is something that is curved on one side and flat on the other side , but you folded it in half .
12896	0	a	, but I mean you can
12897	0	a	Yeah , I I think so too ,
12898	0	a	I mean the case would be
12899	0	a	yeah
12900	0	a	the case would be rubber and the the buttons ,
12901	0	a	rubber buttons , but then
12902	0	a	Yeah .
12903	0	a	Yeah ,
12904	0	a	but y your spinning wheel tends to go to one side .
12905	0	a	Th that would be on one side , uh huh .
12906	0	a	i it
12907	1	a	Or or at the corners , edges , just the edges covered by rubber or something like that .
12908	0	a	No , I think it is just the casing rubber on the outside .
12909	0	a	You want an outside of rubber
12910	0	a	and then open it up and
12911	1	a	Or maybe like interchangeable cases .
12912	0	a	Yeah .
12913	0	a	Yeah .
12914	1	a	Everything else in plastic or even titanium if we want to use it .
12915	0	a	Cause I know like we are going back to iPods again n the whole spinning wheel , but I have like a you know , obviously my iPod is not made of rubber , but then I have a little rubber case that goes over the top of it
12916	0	a	and I can change the colour , theoretically , to match my outfit .
12917	0	a	Right , right .
12918	0	a	Right ,
12919	0	a	okay ,
12920	0	a	so so that gives us a more trendy look as well .
12921	0	a	Right .
12922	0	a	Yeah ,
12923	0	a	I think the spinning wheel is definitely very now .
12924	0	a	Yeah , and we are going more for the trends than for the usability anyway , right ?
12925	0	a	So
12926	1	a	I will rub that out .
12927	0	a	That is right ,
12928	0	a	that is what they are after .
12929	0	a	Yeah .
12930	0	a	And colours can be provided with the case rather than but we still need to te think about the colour of our remote as such , you know , just keep it black , or
12931	0	a	Yeah
12932	0	a	I think we
12933	0	a	it was a a requirement that we use our th the colours of our company ,
12934	0	a	so would it be like yellow , grey and black or something , or
12935	0	a	Yeah , does
12936	0	a	Yeah .
12937	0	a	I guess .
12938	0	a	That does not fit in with the whole vegetable theme though .
12939	1	a	Bananas .
12940	0	a	Banana is yellow , yeah , definitely .
12941	0	a	Yeah ,
12942	1	a	but I mean do you think we could incorporate the colours of the company into the buttons and then make the colour of the main remote the colour like vegetable colours , do you know ?
12943	0	a	So you could have like
12944	1	a	I mean I suppose vegetable colours would be orange and green and some reds and maybe purple and that
12945	1	a	and then you would pick the buttons in company colours to to match with it .
12946	1	a	Green .
12947	0	a	Yeah .
12948	0	a	Okay .
12949	1	a	okay , if you g go over to the integrated circuits .
12950	0	a	since we are having LCDs there there is no way that we are will be able to what we do need to consider , however , is that the price is going up for the ever every such thing that we are considering , but since LCDs seems to be a definite yes , so it seems to be one area where we would want to spend .
12951	0	a	We need the advanced
12952	0	a	yeah .
12953	0	a	Yeah .
12954	0	a	Yeah .
12955	1	a	So I will rub off the other two .
12956	0	a	So are we discounting solar energy because rubber is going to be used in there somewhere or
12957	0	a	If
12958	0	a	solar panels with the rubber .
12959	0	a	That was the
12960	0	a	We ca not have solar panels with rubber , so .
12961	0	a	Oh is
12962	0	a	oh the constraint was
12963	0	a	yeah .
12964	0	a	Yeah .
12965	0	a	So
12966	0	a	I think we will have
12967	0	a	using the simple battery will be a safer option as compared to the kinetic energy one , I mean ,
12968	0	a	a although it does seem interesting .
12969	0	a	Yeah , okay , so we lose that I think .
12970	0	a	Shall we go for if we are going for rubber , we think on as our case , and then
12971	0	a	Yeah .
12972	0	a	And the buttons as well , I think .
12973	0	a	Yeah .
12974	0	a	We have got five more minutes .
12975	0	a	Yeah .
12976	0	a	Yeah .
12977	0	a	But it does not hold any advantages as such for a
12978	0	a	yeah .
12979	0	a	Yeah , .
12980	0	a	It is just a gimmick .
12981	0	a	Okay .
12982	0	a	okay , so r we understand this better now that the the speaker is for the feedback , right ?
12983	0	a	It it says the things that you type in or something like that , so
12984	0	a	yeah ,
12985	0	a	we we do not have too much information about it ,
12986	0	a	Yeah , okay ,
12987	0	a	so so th this is in as well then , the sample speaker .
12988	0	a	Yeah .
12989	0	a	I think if we can if we can include them at not too much extra cost , then I would put them in ,
12990	0	a	but if it is
12991	0	a	Yeah .
12992	0	a	Yeah ,
12993	0	a	but it
12994	0	a	it
12995	0	a	I think it should be quite cheap because it is from our own company ,
12996	0	a	yeah .
12997	0	a	It is from the company , so
12998	0	a	Yeah .
12999	0	a	Okay .
13000	0	a	Right .
13001	0	a	And the case is curved on one side , but then flat flat , so it is flipped into each other .
13002	0	a	Flat on the top .
13003	0	a	Yeah .
13004	0	a	Okay .
13005	0	a	Can I pull the thing out the back of your computer ?
13006	0	a	Just so we can
13007	0	a	Nothing ,
13008	0	a	it is right , I am just There we go .
13009	0	a	Yeah , sure j
13010	0	a	Sorry ,
13011	1	a	do you want me to
13012	0	a	What does ICS mean ?
13013	0	a	Okay , cool .
13014	0	a	ICs ?
13015	0	a	integrated circuits .
13016	0	a	So it is advanced integrated circuits ?
13017	0	a	Imagine it would be inside .
13018	0	a	Yeah .
13019	0	a	oh now I have gone too far .
13020	0	a	we we are definitely going in for voice recognition as well as LCDs , .
13021	0	a	Yeah .
13022	0	a	Yeah .
13023	0	a	We are on our way .
13024	0	a	Okay .
13025	0	a	So we have basically worked out that we are going with a simple battery , the advanced chip and a curved on one side case which is folded in on itself , made out of rubber and the buttons are also rubber .
13026	0	a	Right .
13027	0	a	Yep .
13028	0	a	We are having push buttons on the outside and then on the inside an LCD with spinning wheel , and we are incorporating voice recognition .
13029	0	a	That is our overall concept , and it is going to look sort of vegetable , and be in bright vegetable colours .
13030	0	a	Uh huh .
13031	0	a	So w w would with have the spinning wheel inside with the LCD , or would it be on the outer
13032	0	a	Okay .
13033	0	a	I think it is on the
13034	0	a	Mm mm .
13035	0	a	So actually that could like really cut down your thing , so you have got your outside , which is like minimalist , and then you open it up and you have got a screen and a spinning wheel , which you can incorporate buttons into .
13036	0	a	Yeah , okay .
13037	0	a	so you have still not got like a lot of stuff in the You have maybe got
13038	0	a	, you know like if you are modelling on iPod you have got five buttons and a wheel , and four of the buttons are in the wheel , and the other one is the little bit inside the wheel ,
13039	0	a	yeah .
13040	0	a	Yeah .
13041	0	a	On the
13042	0	a	In the centre ,
13043	0	a	yeah , sure .
13044	0	a	yeah .
13045	0	a	Okay , so now we have got thirty minutes before our next meeting .
13046	0	a	In the meantime , the Industrial Designer over here is going to work on the look and feel design ,
13047	1	a	which I will presume he will work out what that means .
13048	0	a	the User Interface Designer will work on the user interface design and the Marketing Expert is going to work on product evaluation .
13049	0	a	And as well as that , the two designers are going to work together on our prototype following those instructions that we have just come up with using modelling clay and you will get extra instructions from your personal coach .
13050	0	a	Cool .
13051	0	a	Is that all okay ?
13052	0	a	And anyone who has not put their their presentation in the project documents folder , it would be good just so in case
13053	0	a	we have to refer to it .
13054	0	a	Yeah .
13055	0	a	Cool ,
13056	0	a	I am going to go and sit on my own .
13057	0	a	Y nobody wants to talk to you .
13058	0	a	I know , I am hated .
13059	1	a	Unplug yourself .
13060	0	a	So but shall I move away first or shall I stay here with
13061	0	a	I dunno ,
13062	0	a	 
13063	0	a	I am proud of it .
13064	0	a	Okay .
13065	0	a	This is our final meeting , the detailed design meeting .
13066	1	a	And again I will take minutes .
13067	0	a	The
13068	0	a	what we have to get through in this meeting is firstly the prototype presentation from you two ,
13069	1	a	so you can show us what you have been working on so diligently .
13070	1	a	Yeah .
13071	0	a	then
13072	0	a	then Cat is going to present the evaluation criteria that we are going to be evaluating this against .
13073	0	a	It does look very cool .
13074	0	a	Then I need to say some st a few things about finance , cause we have to check that it is within the finance criteria .
13075	0	a	and then we will be making sure that our product fits both the evaluation criteria from Cat and the financial limits .
13076	0	a	and then we will have a brief evaluation of the whole process of production and design that we have been through .
13077	0	a	So we have got forty minutes .
13078	0	a	And then do we get to make a remote control ?
13079	0	a	Yeah .
13080	0	a	S
13081	0	a	Cause we missed out .
13082	0	a	So
13083	0	a	it is now I guess that we are supposed to start at fifteen thirty five , so we have got until four fifteen .
13084	0	a	Uh huh .
13085	0	a	Is that right ?
13086	0	a	Yeah ,
13087	0	a	until about four fifteen .
13088	0	a	How how much do we have , forty minutes ?
13089	0	a	Yeah .
13090	0	a	Yeah , about four fifteen , yeah .
13091	0	a	Yeah .
13092	0	a	So yeah .
13093	0	a	Okay , so .
13094	1	a	Go for it .
13095	0	a	Do you want
13096	0	a	Yes .
13097	0	a	So , you said
13098	0	a	are are we starting with the the
13099	1	a	so will you maybe start with like the the shape and things
13100	1	a	and and then I will explain the the user interface th things , like the buttons and the scrolling things and
13101	0	a	Well , but it is it is just an a approximation .
13102	0	a	Presentation .
13103	1	a	Okay .
13104	0	a	Okay .
13105	0	a	So basically going with our trend of vegetables and we selected the colour and approximate shape of banana .
13106	0	a	Yeah .
13107	0	a	You think bananas are a safe thing to use ?
13108	0	a	It is a bit phallic .
13109	0	a	Yeah .
13110	0	a	Dual use , perfect .
13111	0	a	Dual use , perfect .
13112	0	a	Oh ,
13113	0	a	your remote control
13114	0	a	Oh that is just bad .
13115	0	a	Does it vibrate when you press the buttons ?
13116	0	a	Sorry , sorry .
13117	0	a	so basically it is the it is the flip open thing again .
13118	0	a	So now we we have the okay ,
13119	0	a	so Ma Maarika will explain you the user interface there .
13120	0	a	And it flips open on the side , so it opens like that .
13121	0	a	And we have the user interface o in here and the the LCD and and the scroll are inside .
13122	0	a	Wow .
13123	0	a	well , everything else is probably user interface , so .
13124	0	a	Yeah ,
13125	0	a	yeah .
13126	0	a	yeah .
13127	0	a	And it is the whole thing is made of rubber , is that
13128	0	a	Rubber .
13129	0	a	Oh yeah .
13130	0	a	Yeah , it has , yeah .
13131	0	a	Yeah , .
13132	0	a	Is it to scale , or do you think you can make it a bit smaller ?
13133	0	a	Yeah .
13134	0	a	it could be made a bit smaller , and and of course it would be
13135	0	a	and
13136	0	a	yeah ,
13137	0	a	but one thing we actually kind of forgot while designing , that one side was supposed to be rounder ,
13138	0	a	so we said the back side round , yeah .
13139	0	a	Yeah ,
13140	0	a	well ,
13141	0	a	but i since it is made of rubber anyway .
13142	0	a	I I think it is it is
13143	0	a	Yeah .
13144	0	a	Yeah .
13145	0	a	It l does look like the curvy and then the whole shape is curvy , so I would say that this curvy does look quite like a vegetable .
13146	0	a	Yeah .
13147	0	a	Yeah .
13148	0	a	And it is spongy as well .
13149	0	a	I was not very keen on that , but
13150	0	a	yeah .
13151	0	a	So so the user interface as as we discussed last time on on the on the cover we just have the very basic things .
13152	0	a	Huh .
13153	0	a	So we have that n channels here starting from one two three
13154	0	a	there would be numbers in in the on the actual one .
13155	0	a	Yeah .
13156	0	a	So it is four , up to four , up to seven , up to nine and zero , z zero here .
13157	0	a	Six seven eight nine .
13158	0	a	I like that .
13159	0	a	Yeah .
13160	0	a	And then , well this is on off button .
13161	0	a	It is it is quite standard place for it and and also the colour is quite often red , so it is it is kind of user friendly .
13162	0	a	Yeah .
13163	0	a	And then these ones would be for flipping the channels back and like the previous one and the next one .
13164	0	a	Uh huh .
13165	0	a	And and we would also have a l little thing saying here , previous and ne prevon prevon next .
13166	0	a	So where is the volume ?
13167	0	a	, you did get that in then ,
13168	0	a	Yeah .
13169	0	a	The volume is is scrolling .
13170	0	a	On the side ,
13171	0	a	this one .
13172	0	a	It is on the side .
13173	0	a	Yeah you just do it like this .
13174	0	a	And and and it is it is on the back
13175	0	a	is cover or back lid , because if you flip it open , you can still do the scrolling here .
13176	0	a	Oh okay , .
13177	0	a	See ?
13178	0	a	So the volume is you just scroll , but then once you flip it open , okay , there there you have the screen and
13179	0	a	and you have the spinning wheel with options to choose .
13180	0	a	Yeah .
13181	0	a	You can move back and forth and then if you need to m choose something on the screen , you just push the cen the middle button .
13182	0	a	Cool .
13183	0	a	Oh , the thing we forgot was like a mute button .
13184	0	a	A mute button .
13185	0	a	no , we we would not put
13186	0	a	so on on the cover we have the the bare essentials .
13187	0	a	Yeah .
13188	0	a	Well , we will have this on the screen , on the display .
13189	1	a	On the wheel , like if you hold the wheel down then it will mute .
13190	0	a	on the LCD we r you know , the main menu will have various options .
13191	0	a	Well , but the but the mute
13192	0	a	yeah , the scrolling is kind of you have to scroll all the way to make it mute , right ?
13193	0	a	Okay ,
13194	0	a	yeah ,
13195	0	a	okay .
13196	1	a	Y or you could have it
13197	1	a	so you on the wheel
13198	1	a	if you But if you hold it in , if it is a scroll and click so you hold it in ?
13199	0	a	no .
13200	0	a	Yeah , but it is a scroll and click , is not it ?
13201	0	a	Okay , cool .
13202	0	a	So that that solves the whole mute issue .
13203	0	a	Yeah .
13204	0	a	And okay ,
13205	0	a	so i so the the voice recognition is also just part of it .
13206	0	a	You ca not really see it in the interface .
13207	0	a	Yeah , it is hidden in there somewhere .
13208	0	a	Yeah .
13209	0	a	And we do have the logo on it as well .
13210	0	a	, very good .
13211	0	a	So I think it
13212	0	a	Yeah .
13213	0	a	And it is with the the black and yellow you are even in the right colours .
13214	1	a	Yeah , I think we could do l the logo in grey , as it is on the website .
13215	0	a	Cool .
13216	0	a	Yeah .
13217	0	a	We ran out of resources here , so .
13218	0	a	In the actual one .
13219	0	a	Yeah .
13220	1	a	So if you have questions .
13221	1	a	You can have a look .
13222	1	a	Very good , let is have a look .
13223	0	a	Test it out .
13224	0	a	it is a sort of intermediate colour , I guess .
13225	0	a	Yeah , oh , we hold the remote .
13226	0	a	Oh , but it it does feel all cold and slimy .
13227	0	a	I hate Play Do , it is just minging .
13228	0	a	But yeah , that is cool , cool .
13229	0	a	Very good .
13230	1	a	Okay , so maybe if we go on to evaluation cri criteria
13231	0	a	and then we will there
13232	0	a	I suspect we are going to have a couple of minor finance issues , but we will se I am sure we can get around them somehow .
13233	1	a	Okay .
13234	0	a	Yeah , see the budget .
13235	1	a	We will just send all of our manufacturing to some nice poor country and cut some of the prices that way .
13236	1	a	Wales .
13237	1	a	Wales , for example .
13238	0	a	Cool
13239	0	a	, okay .
13240	0	a	Right , okay .
13241	0	a	Fabulous , yeah .
13242	0	a	Marketing Expert .
13243	0	a	Okay , cool .
13244	0	a	So what we are going to do is prefer prepare the evaluation of the new design .
13245	0	a	so we are going to be using a seven point scale , so one is , you know , yes , it totally meets with that requirement and seven is , no
13246	0	a	, it really does not , we need to go back and start again .
13247	0	a	, you know .
13248	0	a	Basically , what I did was I went through all the like user requirements and things that we have done and we have worked on and like made a list of them .
13249	0	a	you know , so that we can evaluate each one and like so it was about going back to the start and saying
13250	0	a	oh yeah , we did manage to do that , or oh no , we really forgot about that .
13251	0	a	Yeah .
13252	0	a	Okay ?
13253	0	a	Cool ,
13254	0	a	so these are what they are .
13255	0	a	Oh
13256	0	a	Yes , I did have A , B , C , and D down here , but it seems to have turned into like just bullet points .
13257	0	a	So for each of these we need to give it a one to seven .
13258	0	a	Is that right ?
13259	0	a	dots , never mind .
13260	1	a	Okay .
13261	1	a	But if you can imagine that they say A , B , C , and D , then that would be really good .
13262	1	a	I guess we will give it maximum points in everything .
13263	0	a	Yeah , the yeah , it is definitely attractive .
13264	0	a	Yeah , I agree .
13265	0	a	Oh , the locatable thing we actually forgot .
13266	0	a	Well , I thought we would kind of said that you would have a little thing to stick on the TV ?
13267	0	a	Yeah .
13268	0	a	Yeah .
13269	0	a	Yeah , just prepare one now .
13270	1	a	Shall I just prepare it now ?
13271	0	a	It will be red , too .
13272	0	a	Cool .
13273	0	a	Okay .
13274	0	a	So , be attractive to look at .
13275	0	a	That is this one .
13276	0	a	What do you all say ?
13277	0	a	Yeah .
13278	0	a	So ?
13279	0	a	Yes .
13280	0	a	I reckon it
13281	0	a	Yeah .
13282	0	a	S seven was th the maximum , yeah ?
13283	0	a	I I go for seven .
13284	0	a	Seven , yeah , it is terribly sexy .
13285	0	a	Oh we are all so proud of the .
13286	0	a	Yeah .
13287	0	a	Okay , so that will be a seven for A .
13288	0	a	Could
13289	0	a	oh no , you ca not whilst that is up there .
13290	0	a	Okay what I have done on the next page is I have set it up
13291	0	a	so we just put the marks in .
13292	0	a	, okay .
13293	0	a	Okay .
13294	0	a	Excellent .
13295	0	a	Except we ca not we can if we
13296	1	a	then yeah , I will take a note , it is fine .
13297	0	a	Yeah .
13298	0	a	But that is alright .
13299	0	a	But we can we can
13300	1	a	I can I can take note
13301	0	a	the the only thing that we were considering was that this thing is kind of more for right handed people than for left handed people , so if you are left handed you are kind of left scrolling with your finger .
13302	1	a	If you take a note of them ,
13303	1	a	and then I will put them in in a minute .
13304	0	a	Okay , so we are all agreeing on seven for A ?
13305	0	a	Cool
13306	0	a	, okay .
13307	0	a	Yeah .
13308	0	a	Does it match the operating behaviour of the user ?
13309	0	a	Yeah .
13310	0	a	I would think yes , yeah .
13311	0	a	I think it does .
13312	0	a	I mean
13313	0	a	Yeah .
13314	0	a	Yeah ,
13315	1	a	so y so we we might do we might want to do like a another m model another another version , which is like exactly the mirror image of this one .
13316	0	a	Alright .
13317	0	a	But that is going to be a problem ,
13318	0	a	cause you do not always have all left handers or all right handers in a family .
13319	0	a	But then yeah .
13320	0	a	Yeah .
13321	0	a	Yeah .
13322	0	a	So bu it is it is not a huge problem , because i i it is operatable .
13323	0	a	I th
13324	0	a	I think it is not it is not like it is a pen .
13325	0	a	But then then I think left handed people are already used to discrimination anyway , so they just
13326	0	a	Yeah .
13327	0	a	Yeah .
13328	0	a	Yeah ,
13329	0	a	but I mean because it is not like it is a pen
13330	0	a	, you know , left handed people
13331	0	a	ca not normally write right handed , but they can normally do most things
13332	0	a	right handed
13333	0	a	, so I would say it is not such a big issue .
13334	0	a	Yeah .
13335	0	a	Right .
13336	0	a	Yeah , because I mean anyway , right handed people would be able to scroll with it , so i if the majority are right handed , it is
13337	1	a	Or maybe six ,
13338	0	a	because it is just one one
13339	0	a	i one among the issues ,
13340	0	a	I mean .
13341	0	a	Yeah .
13342	0	a	Yeah .
13343	0	a	Yeah .
13344	0	a	I mean you can you can use your finger to to scroll rather than your thumb .
13345	0	a	Yeah .
13346	0	a	Yep .
13347	0	a	So I mean that does kind of negate the whole RSI issue .
13348	1	a	So maybe we need to put that needs a little bit of investigation , maybe give it a five , I would say ?
13349	0	a	What do you what do you all think ?
13350	0	a	Okay .
13351	0	a	Six .
13352	0	a	Yeah ,
13353	0	a	I think I think for
13354	0	a	I mean most people are right handed , so in in terms of our greatest target group , I think it is pretty good ,
13355	1	a	but we might want to flag it for management , they want might want to
13356	0	a	They
13357	0	a	Yeah .
13358	0	a	Yeah .
13359	0	a	One more thing is that i
13360	0	a	It might be a little clumsy when when it opens up , right ,
13361	0	a	so it opens on the side .
13362	0	a	No , yeah ,
13363	0	a	but but we have it nicely with the hinges here
13364	0	a	yeah .
13365	0	a	So
13366	0	a	Yeah
13367	0	a	yeah
13368	0	a	yeah ,
13369	0	a	I mean
13370	0	a	yeah .
13371	0	a	So it wo not be a problem ,
13372	0	a	it will be and it will be
13373	0	a	it wo not be heavy .
13374	0	a	Yeah .
13375	0	a	Yeah .
13376	0	a	So you guys can decide wh whether
13377	0	a	Oops .
13378	0	a	Yeah .
13379	1	a	I th
13380	1	a	I think the alternative is flipping from the top .
13381	0	a	Yeah well yeah ,
13382	0	a	but it is it is a bit long .
13383	0	a	Yeah , but we which makes it kind of really big , yeah .
13384	0	a	The length is going to be difficu
13385	0	a	It is a little bit long .
13386	0	a	Yeah
13387	0	a	But you were thinking about making it smaller , yeah ?
13388	0	a	Because
13389	0	a	So you have to keep that side flat .
13390	0	a	Well , I mean it can be opened like this of course
13391	0	a	and yeah .
13392	0	a	this this kind of makes it more and two , it might interfere with the IR channel .
13393	0	a	S slightly smaller .
13394	0	a	Yeah , but if we flip it open only as much as that .
13395	0	a	Okay .
13396	0	a	So it works like a mobile phone flipping , but y you know , as long as that side is flat , than that will work .
13397	0	a	Right .
13398	0	a	Okay .
13399	0	a	Okay .
13400	0	a	okay ,
13401	0	a	so C .
13402	0	a	Are are we admitting defeat on C or are we saying we are going to stick a locator on the TV ?
13403	0	a	There is a locator .
13404	0	a	No ,
13405	0	a	we are going to put it like we have got
13406	0	a	th there is the locator dot .
13407	0	a	No , we have a locator .
13408	0	a	Cool , so that means you need a that does mean you need a little speaker on it though ,
13409	0	a	does not it ?
13410	0	a	To make it beep .
13411	0	a	that you stick on TV .
13412	0	a	Yeah well w but
13413	0	a	l but the speak sample speaker is included , so it it has some capacity to to do some to make some sounds ,
13414	0	a	so yeah .
13415	0	a	Yeah .
13416	0	a	Or a buzzer .
13417	0	a	Yeah .
13418	0	a	Okay .
13419	0	a	Yeah .
13420	0	a	So that is two , so that is seven ,
13421	0	a	yeah .
13422	0	a	It is locatable ?
13423	0	a	Fabulous .
13424	0	a	Yep .
13425	0	a	D .
13426	0	a	Intuitive , completely intuitive .
13427	0	a	Yeah .
13428	0	a	If if this means intuitive , if it means the way people kind of are used to finding things
13429	0	a	and it is I th
13430	0	a	I think it is
13431	0	a	Yeah .
13432	0	a	Yeah .
13433	0	a	I would say six ,
13434	0	a	cause the I mean the the standard layout for numbers is three three three and one , rather than the way you have got it .
13435	0	a	I really like the way you have it ,
13436	0	a	but it is not the immediate thing that you are used to .
13437	0	a	Yeah .
13438	0	a	Intuitive .
13439	0	a	Yeah , and I mean d
13440	1	a	So , should we maybe say f a five and say it is intuitive , but it is different ,
13441	0	a	so , do you know , I mean it is obvious how to use it , but you might have to think about it first .
13442	0	a	So Might be
13443	0	a	But it and it is something that they will be experiencing in a lot of different places soon .
13444	0	a	And even the scroll , it is a it is a new technology
13445	0	a	so m m might be a little more difficult for people to get used to in the beginni
13446	0	a	so it is kind of not very intuitive
13447	0	a	but it is a good technology ,
13448	0	a	I mean once they get used to it .
13449	0	a	Yeah .
13450	0	a	So l
13451	0	a	Yeah , okay .
13452	1	a	Five ?
13453	0	a	Yeah .
13454	0	a	So we give that one a five , you think ?
13455	0	a	Yep .
13456	0	a	I am happy with five ?
13457	0	a	Yeah .
13458	0	a	I am going to give a seven in everything , so .
13459	0	a	Yeah .
13460	0	a	I am glad you are accepting this .
13461	0	a	It has taken a little while , has not it ?
13462	0	a	intuitive but
13463	0	a	Sorry ,
13464	0	a	it is really hard to write on those .
13465	0	a	I just went a bit mad , did not I ?
13466	0	a	okay , cool ,
13467	0	a	E ,
13468	0	a	okay .
13469	0	a	I would guess this comes back from this whole B thing links in here , so possibly for left handed .
13470	0	a	Investigate .
13471	0	a	Yep .
13472	0	a	But otherwise it is superb .
13473	0	a	So , should we give it a six ?
13474	0	a	Six ?
13475	0	a	I used to send fifty texts a day , you know , and I never got repetitive strain injury from that , so I find it quite hard to believe to be honest .
13476	0	a	Six .
13477	0	a	the ergonom ergonomic design
13478	0	a	well
13479	0	a	I mean I d I dunno ,
13480	0	a	I mean the the repetitive stress things , but then who would be really pushing the buttons so much on the on the remote control anyway ,
13481	0	a	yeah ?
13482	0	a	See .
13483	0	a	Yeah .
13484	0	a	Yeah .
13485	0	a	Yeah ,
13486	0	a	unless you are a all the time sitting .
13487	0	a	Yeah , so it is kind of
13488	0	a	Yeah .
13489	0	a	Yeah .
13490	0	a	Well we have banned them from Yeah .
13491	0	a	Yeah , I I think it is ergonomic .
13492	0	a	yeah .
13493	0	a	And moreover it it has LCD and everything , so that you know we minimise the pressing of the buttons anyway .
13494	0	a	Yeah ,
13495	0	a	it is varied .
13496	1	a	Yeah .
13497	0	a	Okay , so we give that a six ,
13498	0	a	yeah .
13499	1	a	Six ?
13500	0	a	Voice control have seven .
13501	0	a	Okay , F .
13502	0	a	Yeah , it does have
13503	0	a	yeah .
13504	0	a	Absolutely .
13505	0	a	Hang on ,
13506	0	a	how come it is showing up with the things there but it only had bullet points there ?
13507	0	a	That is just
13508	0	a	Oh okay , cool .
13509	0	a	, that is the second one .
13510	0	a	So you must have changed it on this one where it is got score , but not on the previous slide .
13511	0	a	right , so .
13512	0	a	So it has voice control .
13513	0	a	Yes ,
13514	0	a	so that is a seven then .
13515	0	a	Yep .
13516	0	a	, cool .
13517	0	a	G technologically innovative .
13518	0	a	Anyway it ha
13519	0	a	yeah ,
13520	0	a	it is the most sophisticated remote that I ever seen .
13521	0	a	Technologi well
13522	0	a	Yeah .
13523	0	a	But in terms of the actual technology , none of it is actually new .
13524	0	a	Well we have we have the sample speaker as well , which is
13525	0	a	yeah , it is kind of new .
13526	0	a	Yeah .
13527	0	a	Yeah ,
13528	0	a	but I mean you do not
13529	0	a	They are never been used i they have never been using remote remote control before I do not think .
13530	0	a	All of the components have been used in other things before .
13531	0	a	But at the same time they are all they are all relatively new .
13532	0	a	Yeah , but they have been brought together in a remote .
13533	0	a	But do
13534	0	a	yeah ,
13535	0	a	yeah .
13536	0	a	Yeah .
13537	1	a	What do you reckon , five , six ?
13538	0	a	Yeah .
13539	0	a	Yeah ,
13540	0	a	what do you all think ?
13541	0	a	Six ?
13542	0	a	Well , that is it , I mean
13543	0	a	Yeah ,
13544	0	a	but I mean everything has been used in space before it gets to anyone else really , has not it ?
13545	0	a	So , I do not think many peop
13546	0	a	That is it , they can take it with them .
13547	0	a	Six .
13548	0	a	Yeah .
13549	0	a	I mean how how far can you go with a remote control , really ?
13550	0	a	It still has to do what i what it has to do .
13551	0	a	Space remote .
13552	0	a	Put fashion in electronics .
13553	0	a	Absolutely .
13554	0	a	Yeah , is not it fashionable ?
13555	0	a	Yeah , sure .
13556	0	a	The carrot banana remote .
13557	0	a	It is the maximum fashion .
13558	0	a	So , we give it seven ,
13559	0	a	and we write
13560	0	a	There we go .
13561	0	a	Fruit fruit and vegetables are fashionable these days , so .
13562	0	a	So I think we have done very well ,
13563	0	a	but
13564	0	a	What is the assessment ?
13565	0	a	The average is about six and something .
13566	0	a	I think that is a .
13567	0	a	Cool .
13568	0	a	Very good .
13569	0	a	Yeah .
13570	0	a	So , we need the average here ,
13571	0	a	so we got Seven
13572	0	a	So we have got four sevens , so that is twenty eight , three sixes , eighteen .
13573	0	a	Yeah , one .
13574	0	a	A little bit over six .
13575	0	a	Or a seven .
13576	0	a	There are how many sixes ?
13577	0	a	One , two , three .
13578	0	a	No , wait ,
13579	0	a	a little bit under six .
13580	0	a	No , wait .
13581	0	a	Three .
13582	0	a	And one five .
13583	0	a	Oh , three sixes , okay , yeah .
13584	0	a	Fifty one , one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight .
13585	0	a	Okay , twenty eight , thirty eight , fo forty six .
13586	0	a	Forty six and five , fifty one .
13587	0	a	Six point point
13588	0	a	about six point five .
13589	0	a	Fifty one divided by
13590	0	a	I guess it will have to wait for a bit .
13591	0	a	Six point something , yeah .
13592	0	a	Two three four Seven eight .
13593	0	a	Six point five , yeah .
13594	0	a	Close enough .
13595	0	a	Okay ,
13596	0	a	that is pretty good , I think .
13597	0	a	Now wait until we get to finance
13598	0	a	and then we will see if we can afford it .
13599	0	a	That is all you have got at the moment , or did you have anything more ?
13600	0	a	That is it ?
13601	0	a	Alright .
13602	0	a	no , that is it , yeah .
13603	0	a	So , finance .
13604	1	a	And we will see if we can unscrew this first .
13605	0	a	Cool , there we go .
13606	0	a	Sorry ,
13607	0	a	this is I am just
13608	0	a	Beautiful .
13609	0	a	There we go and there are the marks .
13610	0	a	Yeah .
13611	0	a	Not anymore .
13612	0	a	Computer no signal ?
13613	0	a	Adjusting .
13614	0	a	There we go .
13615	0	a	Okay ,
13616	0	a	so we have looked at the prototype presentation and the evaluation criteria .
13617	0	a	And now we have to calculate the production costs .
13618	0	a	So I have got an Excel spreadsheet to help us do that .
13619	0	a	Can you read that ?
13620	0	a	Almost .
13621	0	a	More or less .
13622	0	a	I started filling it in , but of course these are provisional , so we have to go down .
13623	0	a	No hand dynamo , right ?
13624	0	a	One simple battery .
13625	0	a	Yeah .
13626	0	a	Yeah .
13627	0	a	No kinetic energy , no solar .
13628	0	a	The chip , we are going for an advanced chip on print .
13629	0	a	Advanced , yeah .
13630	0	a	We also said the sample sensor and sample speaker .
13631	0	a	Yep .
13632	0	a	single curved surface , so that we can fold it .
13633	0	a	Yeah , yes .
13634	0	a	Case material we said rubber .
13635	0	a	Rubber .
13636	0	a	Yep .
13637	0	a	I do not know what special colour means .
13638	0	a	anything I think which is not more .
13639	0	a	I think something coloured ,
13640	0	a	yeah , probably .
13641	0	a	So I think this is probably special co no ?
13642	0	a	Yeah .
13643	0	a	It could be
13644	0	a	Rub rubber comes coloured ,
13645	0	a	it is I would
13646	1	a	maybe it is like if you want titanium coloured or wood coloured , it is different .
13647	0	a	Yeah .
13648	0	a	Yeah ,
13649	0	a	but rubber comes coloured , does not it ?
13650	0	a	You know .
13651	1	a	Or maybe maybe if you want some kind of pattern thing on it ,
13652	0	a	yeah
13653	0	a	yeah ,
13654	0	a	okay .
13655	0	a	Yeah ,
13656	1	a	let is leave it as zero , cause it is easy .
13657	0	a	Yeah .
13658	0	a	Yeah ,
13659	1	a	you might end up having to take off the sample sensor .
13660	0	a	We we are definitely going to have to
13661	0	a	so we have got pushbutton ,
13662	0	a	and then we have
13663	0	a	Scroll wheel with pushbutton we had , no ?
13664	0	a	We have pushbuttons , scro we have scroll wheel as well .
13665	0	a	S
13666	0	a	yeah ,
13667	0	a	yeah ,
13668	0	a	we had , for muting , yeah .
13669	0	a	No we we have
13670	0	a	yeah .
13671	0	a	Yeah .
13672	0	a	And we have LC display
13673	0	a	and yeah .
13674	0	a	And button supplements .
13675	0	a	Yeah , but what do we ha we have LC display , but but the wh but the s spinning wheel
13676	0	a	Yeah .
13677	0	a	no .
13678	0	a	No .
13679	0	a	We do not have
13680	0	a	we are not using any of that .
13681	0	a	No .
13682	0	a	No ?
13683	0	a	But the the spinning wheel is not there .
13684	0	a	I have think maybe it is integrated with the LC display ?
13685	0	a	I think the pushbutton
13686	0	a	oh .
13687	0	a	Okay , let is
13688	0	a	yeah .
13689	0	a	We have got more than one pushbutton though ,
13690	0	a	have not we ?
13691	0	a	Cause then you have
13692	0	a	That means you can only have twenty five push buttons in total does not it ?
13693	0	a	Not counting anything , we would still be in budget .
13694	0	a	I do not know if that is one
13695	0	a	Yeah .
13696	0	a	That seems unlikely .
13697	0	a	Push what
13698	0	a	whether whether pushbutton means that p count by button or do we
13699	0	a	I do not think that makes sense .
13700	0	a	Huh ?
13701	0	a	Wh wh what is the limit ? .
13702	0	a	Twelve point five .
13703	0	a	We have to count all of them ,
13704	0	a	or yeah .
13705	0	a	I do not think so , no .
13706	0	a	No .
13707	0	a	Well it does not , but it
13708	0	a	And LC display .
13709	0	a	No it says what what is the kind of interface , if it is pushbutton then you got a zero point five , it is a scroll wheel
13710	0	a	so we we have put it is pushbutton and scroll wheel and LCD display , so that is that is the three kind of interfaces that we have .
13711	0	a	No .
13712	0	a	Yeah .
13713	0	a	Yeah .
13714	0	a	Yeah .
13715	0	a	Yeah .
13716	0	a	So , as we can see , that is way too expensive down here .
13717	0	a	Wh wh what is our criteria ?
13718	0	a	okay .
13719	0	a	This sample sensor .
13720	0	a	Our budget is twelve point five .
13721	0	a	Yeah , the sample sensor will have to go , cause that is the most expensive thing on there .
13722	0	a	Yeah ,
13723	0	a	so that has implications though for the .
13724	0	a	it does not have for voice recognition , but it does have for the feedback speaker .
13725	0	a	when you say when you press one it says one or it says hello .
13726	0	a	Yeah .
13727	0	a	For the locator .
13728	0	a	But that is a bit of a gimmick anyway really , is not it ?
13729	0	a	We can afford to get rid of it .
13730	0	a	Yeah .
13731	0	a	and the locator also goes away .
13732	0	a	But it was very no innovative
13733	0	a	innovativeness .
13734	0	a	Yeah .
13735	0	a	So that means no locator , does it ?
13736	0	a	I mean does
13737	0	a	Yeah .
13738	0	a	Well yeah .
13739	0	a	What else does it need ?
13740	0	a	Yeah ,
13741	0	a	cause the sample speaker was , I think , more complicated then just a beeping thing .
13742	0	a	Well the speaker the sample speaker is is expensive ,
13743	1	a	but we could just have some some very very easy device that just beeps .
13744	0	a	This would be
13745	0	a	Yeah ,
13746	0	a	yeah yeah
13747	0	a	there you record your samples your speech samples and
13748	0	a	Yeah , then then we would be in the b budget .
13749	0	a	Yeah .
13750	0	a	Yeah , okay , so we
13751	0	a	Uh huh .
13752	0	a	A also i in the case I am not sure that you will evaluate this as a curved surface , because it is just rubber , so it is probably a flat surface rubber .
13753	0	a	I mean
13754	0	a	yeah .
13755	0	a	Okay , yeah .
13756	0	a	Right , so we need one fifty off .
13757	0	a	So tha that mean that we cannot press
13758	0	a	how do we how do we make a selection in in the LCD ?
13759	0	a	If
13760	0	a	in the LCD we can scroll , right ?
13761	0	a	But how do we make a selection if we d cannot push the button .
13762	0	a	See , I was going to say the scroll wheel pushbutton thing ,
13763	0	a	cause
13764	0	a	But that is well you would just have to to spin it down .
13765	1	a	Take it down to just a scroll wheel .
13766	0	a	We could do
13767	0	a	Yeah .
13768	0	a	Yeah b
13769	0	a	no no ,
13770	0	a	you can push this one , but we do not have a pushbutton
13771	0	a	we ca we do not have this muting mechanism for this scrolling thing .
13772	0	a	You can have to scroll it straight r roll it straight down for for mute .
13773	0	a	So that is point three .
13774	0	a	No w w w
13775	0	a	but ha
13776	0	a	it is it is the scroll wheel
13777	0	a	and I thought we were referring to this as a scroll spinning wheel and pushbutton thing .
13778	1	a	But I mean we can put an additional mute button on the top as well .
13779	0	a	If you
13780	0	a	Yeah ,
13781	0	a	I mean that would not actually cost any more .
13782	0	a	That is the spin wheel though , is not it ?
13783	0	a	Did not that come with the LC
13784	0	a	Yeah .
13785	0	a	That is with the LC We decided , cause it is not on our list .
13786	0	a	That comes with the LCD ?
13787	0	a	Oh so so the the this is
13788	0	a	Yeah .
13789	0	a	The scroll wheel is on the side .
13790	0	a	So
13791	0	a	we are adding costs for right , okay
13792	0	a	I mean I think this is good .
13793	0	a	So
13794	0	a	S
13795	0	a	so we are point three over .
13796	0	a	We are point three over at the moment .
13797	0	a	It is nothing n
13798	0	a	Yeah ,
13799	0	a	I have
13800	0	a	Yeah .
13801	1	a	Unless we just take off the scroll wheel altogether and just have pushbuttons for the volume .
13802	0	a	Could b still put them on the side .
13803	0	a	But yeah .
13804	0	a	I mean the scroll wheel is pretty cool , but
13805	0	a	Yeah .
13806	0	a	Instead of scrolling here we have two buttons here , up for up and down .
13807	0	a	Yeah .
13808	0	a	On the side .
13809	0	a	it sounds good actually , yeah .
13810	0	a	Okay , yeah .
13811	0	a	Rather than having three different things that people have to do .
13812	0	a	Okay .
13813	0	a	There we go .
13814	0	a	Oh look , we are way under budget and we will make huge profits and we will all get bonuses .
13815	1	a	Yeah , well we could admit to the single curve , could not we ?
13816	0	a	Yeah , but
13817	0	a	Yeah .
13818	0	a	Or or that we have to have some sort of special colour .
13819	0	a	So that is alright .
13820	0	a	We we will leave it at that
13821	1	a	and then I will take I can send it back to management and say we were not quite sure about the colour ,
13822	0	a	if that costs extra then we have still got some space for it ,
13823	0	a	yeah .
13824	0	a	We have , yeah .
13825	0	a	Yeah .
13826	0	a	Yeah .
13827	0	a	Excellent .
13828	0	a	Alright .
13829	0	a	So did we lose on our evaluation criteria , as a result of doing that ?
13830	0	a	No .
13831	0	a	No , I do not think so .
13832	0	a	Not really , no .
13833	0	a	Because we keep all the features , we keep voice recognition , we keep LCD display .
13834	0	a	Yeah .
13835	0	a	We
13836	0	a	instead of having scrolling we we just push the buttons .
13837	0	a	Yeah .
13838	0	a	We just got rid of a gimmick that was never anyway , and the scroll wheel is I mean essentially the two buttons that was
13839	0	a	it is not a great difference I do not think .
13840	0	a	Yeah .
13841	0	a	yeah .
13842	0	a	Yeah .
13843	0	a	Yeah .
13844	0	a	Alright then .
13845	0	a	But we lose the locator .
13846	0	a	Really ?
13847	0	a	Cool .
13848	0	a	We are going to have a beep .
13849	0	a	Well we are going to have a beeping thing .
13850	0	a	So instead of speaker , .
13851	0	a	But yeah , it is it is not like sample speaker , but it will just beep , so we still have the locate .
13852	0	a	Yeah .
13853	0	a	Yeah .
13854	0	a	Kay .
13855	0	a	That is not a very exciting colour .
13856	1	a	I think you should make it more vegetable like .
13857	0	a	Which colour , the the colour of the phone or the colour of the
13858	0	a	But it can be yellow as well .
13859	0	a	Tha .
13860	0	a	Oh the the beeper thing .
13861	0	a	It
13862	0	a	Yeah , I think Jen wants it to vibrate .
13863	0	a	It can come in the same colour as the the case .
13864	0	a	Cause we we wo not have run out of our pot of Play Doh .
13865	0	a	You know , your pen vibrates ?
13866	0	a	Yeah .
13867	0	a	Yeah , I know I know , my pen vibrates .
13868	0	a	But only for a very short time .
13869	0	a	okay .
13870	0	a	So
13871	0	a	looks like we have designed a banana .
13872	0	a	Well done , team .
13873	0	a	we need
13874	0	a	we have just got about ten minutes or so left of the meeting ,
13875	1	a	so it would be good if we could just have a little talk about the project itself and how it went ,
13876	0	a	so that we can feed back to the management for next time they are designing a product .
13877	0	a	Cool .
13878	0	a	Feedback ?
13879	1	a	Ideas ?
13880	0	a	I think it
13881	0	a	I think n one thing that was lacking was that we did not know what the various things cost to begin with .
13882	0	a	Yeah , as far as creativity is concerned ,
13883	0	a	yeah
13884	0	a	I think there was there was room for creativity .
13885	0	a	The only the only problem being that at the end we had to cut some things down because of the the budget we had .
13886	0	a	Yeah .
13887	0	a	we kap kept a adding things randomly .
13888	0	a	Yeah .
13889	0	a	So , had we known
13890	0	a	Yeah , that or not
13891	0	a	, yeah .
13892	0	a	If we would had that sheet at the beginning should have been like , okay , so we can have that lot , let is just throw it together and do what we can .
13893	0	a	Yeah ,
13894	0	a	yeah ,
13895	0	a	yeah .
13896	0	a	Yeah .
13897	0	a	So d all the random decisions at the end could have been prevented .
13898	0	a	Yeah .
13899	0	a	But in terms of the process of going and working individually and then coming back to a meeting , that that worked in terms of .
13900	0	a	Yeah , .
13901	0	a	I think cause the meetings were so regular , you know .
13902	0	a	It was not like we were alone for very long , so you did not st go off and think , would not it be great to have a vibrating remote control shaped like a banana , and then , you know , come back three days later and Jen is going look , look , it vibrates and it looks like a banana .
13903	0	a	Banana .
13904	0	a	Yeah .
13905	0	a	yeah ,
13906	0	a	so
13907	0	a	yeah .
13908	0	a	Yeah , the m the means were very very good , the means we used .
13909	0	a	the whiteboard digital pens .
13910	0	a	And the pens .
13911	0	a	I like the pens .
13912	0	a	We like the pens .
13913	0	a	I want one .
13914	0	a	That would just be so cool , to d do all your notes and s
13915	0	a	I do not think you should say that was the recording .
13916	0	a	Yeah ,
13917	1	a	you could take it to lectures and just write stuff down and have it printed out when you got back to the office .
13918	0	a	Yeah
13919	0	a	yeah
13920	0	a	yeah ,
13921	0	a	that is it is
13922	0	a	it is
13923	0	a	I wonder what one of these costs .
13924	0	a	Yeah ,
13925	0	a	yeah .
13926	0	a	They great ?
13927	0	a	Do you think they would notice if one went ?
13928	0	a	Oh okay .
13929	1	a	Okay , cover up the microphone .
13930	0	a	Alright , let is take it .
13931	0	a	Yep .
13932	0	a	Shh .
13933	0	a	Yep .
13934	0	a	Okay .
13935	0	a	But that worked well having having a whiteboard that we could draw on as well as having the PowerPoint ,
13936	0	a	cause the I find that the problem with PowerPoint often is that it is so static and you ca not change it once you are in there ,
13937	0	a	yep .
13938	0	a	It is a bit limiting , is not it ?
13939	0	a	Yeah .
13940	0	a	Yeah .
13941	0	a	Yeah .
13942	0	a	Yeah , and and and this time also the time limits but actually preparing the
13943	0	a	Yeah .
13944	0	a	Yeah .
13945	0	a	The thing flew in , you did not have the whole whooshing thing , cause there was not time for that ,
13946	0	a	so yeah .
13947	0	a	Yeah .
13948	0	a	That is alright , that always irritates me anyway , yeah .
13949	0	a	Not that you can do that on the board , either .
13950	0	a	We could make some little
13951	0	a	Yeah , totally ,
13952	0	a	I mean that was fairly tight anyway ,
13953	0	a	I mean especially with that last minute alteration .
13954	0	a	But yeah ,
13955	0	a	but I mean already just just preparing the slides before before the meeting ,
13956	0	a	yeah .
13957	0	a	Yeah .
13958	0	a	Yeah .
13959	0	a	yeah .
13960	0	a	back it , this is just had to be changed
13961	0	a	And yeah , so cool .
13962	0	a	Yeah .
13963	0	a	Are we supposed to say nice things about Jen now ?
13964	0	a	Yeah , definitely .
13965	0	a	And presumably you do not
13966	0	a	you can say nasty things as well .
13967	0	a	Yeah .
13968	0	a	I was I was satisfied with with the leadership ,
13969	0	a	yeah .
13970	0	a	I have no stake in it .
13971	0	a	Yeah .
13972	0	a	You were not like a a dictating leader , so that was always good .
13973	0	a	You have to say that , cause I am taking the notes .
13974	1	a	I will leave the room and you can have another go .
13975	0	a	I know you have got the pen , you might attack me with it .
13976	0	a	Better than that than the banana .
13977	0	a	And then the teamwork I think I think it worked quite quite nicely , yeah .
13978	0	a	I think it worked quite well .
13979	0	a	Yeah .
13980	0	a	Yeah .
13981	0	a	Did anyone feel that they were getting sort of covered up and not being able to say their bit ?
13982	0	a	Yeah .
13983	0	a	To express them
13984	0	a	no .
13985	0	a	I guess it was a fairly small group , so all of us got to express our opinions ,
13986	0	a	yeah .
13987	0	a	Yeah .
13988	0	a	New ideas found .
13989	0	a	Not quite sure what about .
13990	0	a	Well it is it is it is pretty new , pretty novel solution for a for a remote control really , all this flipping open thing
13991	0	a	and
13992	0	a	Yeah ,
13993	0	a	neither neither do I , but I have never seen anything and and none of my examples were was was like this , actually , so .
13994	0	a	Yeah .
13995	0	a	Yeah .
13996	0	a	I do not know ,
13997	0	a	I do not go shopping for remote controls that often , maybe somebody is already though of it .
13998	0	a	Yeah .
13999	0	a	Yeah .
14000	0	a	I will be looking out next time I need to write an essay .
14001	0	a	Yeah , that is right .
14002	0	a	That looks boring , I will see if anyone is made a remote control .
14003	1	a	Yeah maybe w maybe we could have a patent on this one .
14004	0	a	Yeah ,
14005	0	a	yeah .
14006	0	a	Yeah .
14007	0	a	Patent patent patent .
14008	0	a	Banana remote .
14009	0	a	I think we would like to think the ideas were new , but we have got no way of finding out .
14010	0	a	Yeah .
14011	1	a	Or you can always go to Google and type in banana remote control .
14012	0	a	That vibrates
14013	0	a	Yeah , but that would just come up with like other things really would not it .
14014	0	a	Flip .
14015	0	a	Vibrate
14016	0	a	And yeah .
14017	0	a	Nothing that you really want .
14018	0	a	True .
14019	0	a	Yeah .
14020	0	a	Okay .
14021	0	a	So ,
14022	0	a	costs are within budget , well within budget , including a little what have we got ?
14023	0	a	One Euro left over for bits that we did not foresee .
14024	0	a	Yes .
14025	0	a	Yes .
14026	0	a	we have evaluated the project .
14027	0	a	Yes .
14028	0	a	You have got the scores .
14029	0	a	And it is fabulous .
14030	1	a	Can you put that in the project documents file ?
14031	0	a	It is in there already .
14032	0	a	It is in the project documents .
14033	0	a	And the process wheel did not really have any major problems with .
14034	0	a	Were there any was there anything that you found difficult , or anything that did not go as smoothly as you would hope ?
14035	0	a	Yeah .
14036	0	a	And my main difficulty was the the time pressure .
14037	0	a	Otherwise it is it is all fine .
14038	0	a	Yeah ,
14039	0	a	yeah , sometimes it is like a little bit rushed .
14040	0	a	I thought that was good though ,
14041	0	a	because if you are given too much time then you got nothing to do with your time
14042	0	a	and yeah .
14043	0	a	Yeah ,
14044	0	a	yeah ,
14045	0	a	yeah .
14046	1	a	Although we could have made the Rs better had we had five more minute .
14047	0	a	Yeah .
14048	0	a	Okay then .
14049	0	a	I think we are still well within our time .
14050	0	a	Yeah ,
14051	0	a	we have got like five minutes left .
14052	0	a	We have got about five minutes left , but if we have finished , then we have finished .
14053	0	a	Yeah .
14054	0	a	We are just too too efficient
14055	0	a	and you should never drag a meeting on just because you have extra time .
14056	0	a	We certainly are ,
14057	0	a	Yeah .
14058	0	a	Yeah .
14059	0	a	Yes .
14060	0	a	So I would say that is the end of that meeting .
14061	0	a	Yeah , it was a pleasure working with you .
14062	0	a	Thank you , team .
14063	0	a	Kay .
14064	0	a	It was very productive day and no .
14065	0	a	Yeah , same here .
14066	1	a	We could draw animals on the board again .
14067	0	a	no .
14068	0	a	I do not think so .
14069	1	a	You can make some animals .
14070	0	a	I do not like Play Doh , no .
14071	0	a	Oh , you do not like anim
14072	0	a	It does not ?
14073	0	a	Smells quite nice .
14074	0	a	It is just minging .
14075	0	a	It smells so bad .
14076	0	a	It does .
14077	0	a	Smells very sweet .
14078	0	a	Right , so we have to complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary when they send it .
14079	0	a	I do not know if it is already sent or not .
14080	0	a	No , it has not been .
14081	0	a	presumably I have to
14082	0	a	I do not see why you ca not stay here , really .
14083	0	a	Do we have to go back into the other room or can we stay in here now ?
14084	0	a	Did I save this one ?
14085	0	a	Production costs .
14086	0	a	I made your animal for you .
14087	0	a	It was supposed to be pink .
14088	0	a	 
14089	0	a	Okay .
14090	0	a	Ooh .
14091	0	a	So we are kay ?
14092	0	a	On the or
14093	0	a	No .
14094	0	a	I dunno where to put it cause the
14095	0	a	Okay .
14096	1	a	Could you s take it off ? .
14097	0	a	Is that alright ? or
14098	0	a	Okay .
14099	0	a	Okay .
14100	0	a	Keeps coming off .
14101	0	a	Is fiddly .
14102	0	a	Right .
14103	0	a	How do we sta wa how do we start ?
14104	0	a	Does anybody know ?
14105	0	a	So that is this
14106	0	a	Oh okay , right .
14107	0	a	Oh , another one .
14108	0	a	Are we free to take notes
14109	0	a	Okay .
14110	1	a	Okay , just hang on a second everybody .
14111	0	a	I have not actually looked at this yet .
14112	0	a	I have not looked at it ,
14113	1	a	but let is just start it off
14114	1	a	and we will see what happens .
14115	0	a	Very nice .
14116	0	a	If you are all ready .
14117	0	a	Yeah .
14118	0	a	So is the agenda ?
14119	0	a	Opening , acquaintance , tool training and project plan , discussion and then closing .
14120	0	a	Project aim is a new remote control .
14121	0	a	It is original , trendy and it is user friendly .
14122	0	a	Kay .
14123	0	a	Project method , functional design , individual work , another meeting , conceptual design , individual work , and a meeting of details design , individual work and a meeting .
14124	0	a	Tool training .
14125	0	a	Try out the whiteboard , every participant should draw their favourite animal and sum up their favourite characteristics of that animal .
14126	0	a	Okay .
14127	1	a	Miss Industrial Designer , would you like to go first ?
14128	0	a	Yeah ,
14129	1	a	why do not you just c
14130	1	a	, I think just clip on clip

14147	0	a	The back end of an elephant .
14148	0	a	Oh my gosh ,
14149	0	a	I am never going to be able to draw that well .
14150	1	a	Kay , and you want to write up on there ,

14155	0	a	And dunno know why but looks like nice to me .
14156	0	a	Okay .
14157	0	a	Nice animal .
14158	0	a	Wonderful , well done .
14159	1	a	Do you want to use the wipe the m the wiper and wipe it off ?
14160	1	a	And Mister aesthetics designer do you want to go next ?
14161	0	a	No .
14162	1	a	Okay .
14163	1	a	Aesthetic yep , sure .
14164	0	a	I have no idea what my favourite animal is .

14172	0	a	It is a liger , a combination of a lion and tiger .
14173	0	a	Have you not seen Napoleon Dynamite ?
14174	0	a	Oh it is a hilarious movie .
14175	0	a	How .
14176	0	a	No .
14177	0	a	No .

14179	1	a	You have to see it .
14180	0	a	And
14181	0	a	and it is best characteristic
14182	0	a	is it is pretty much the awesomest animal .
14183	0	a	But you have to see the movie to fully appreciate it .

14185	0	a	Great .
14186	1	a	Me ?
14187	0	a	Okay .

14189	0	a	Miss mar Miss Marketing ?
14190	0	a	yeah ,
14191	0	a	I think you can just draw the face ,
14192	1	a	but then you will have to describe in writing how the rest of it looks .
14193	0	a	Not quite sure how this is going to work .
14194	0	a	There go .
14195	0	a	Cool .
14196	1	a	well I will try my best to draw .
14197	0	a	Can I just draw the face ?
14198	0	a	Ooh .
14199	0	a	It is a cat .
14200	0	a	That is a very pr pretty cat .
14201	0	a	Which also has what ?
14202	0	a	A big fat body and big and a long tail .
14203	0	a	Okay ,
14204	0	a	do y do you want to do some write
14205	1	a	you want to just write some words about it ?
14206	0	a	Wow , so they are kind of spiritual .
14207	0	a	Why ?
14208	0	a	Because cuddly .
14209	0	a	And usually cats are very friendly .
14210	0	a	Usually .
14211	0	a	And they are healing as well .
14212	0	a	They heal .
14213	0	a	And they can feel when a human is got problems so
14214	0	a	So , that is why I like cats .
14215	0	a	Well done .
14216	0	a	There we are , that is me .
14217	0	a	Okay .
14218	0	a	, I do not actually have a favourite animal ,
14219	1	a	but for the for th for this meeting I will s draw a little
14220	0	a	I honestly ca not draw for toffee .
14221	0	a	Really ?
14222	0	a	Oh that is a
14223	0	a	Not bad I would say .
14224	0	a	Yeah .
14225	0	a	no
14226	0	a	no
14227	0	a	That is exactly what it is .
14228	0	a	A prairie dog ?
14229	0	a	Oh a squirrel ?
14230	0	a	Yeah , that is pretty good .
14231	0	a	not a very good one
14232	0	a	Okay , well , you got it is a s
14233	0	a	It is a squirrel , and I like them , because they are cute and stupid .
14234	0	a	Very good .
14235	0	a	Alright .
14236	0	a	Right .
14237	0	a	Okay ,
14238	0	a	so , I guess that was the test to see if this equipment is all working .
14239	1	a	Let is move on to the next page .
14240	0	a	Okay , project finance , selling price twenty five Euros , profit aim fifty million Euros .
14241	0	a	Market range internationally sold .
14242	0	a	Yeah .
14243	0	a	Production cost ,
14244	0	a	right
14245	0	a	it is gotta be ca not cost any more than twelve fifty to make .
14246	0	a	right okay .
14247	0	a	experience with with remote control , so talk about who who is used what .
14248	0	a	Any ideas ?
14249	0	a	Stuff like that .
14250	0	a	Next meeting starts in thirty minutes .
14251	0	a	At quarter to twelve .
14252	0	a	So I think before we close , we are expected
14253	0	a	I mean the last slide wanted us to maybe discuss longer what our what our ideas where .
14254	1	a	I mean if you want to go back to the last slide .
14255	0	a	S
14256	0	a	Yeah , I think we are I mean before we close the meeting , we are supposed to come up with some ideas for Yeah .
14257	1	a	Yeah .
14258	0	a	Yeah .
14259	0	a	Oh k so we are actually supposed to be doing this discussion like right now are we or
14260	0	a	oh okay .
14261	0	a	Yeah .
14262	0	a	Yeah .
14263	0	a	I thought this was just t giving us instructions for the re to do next , but
14264	0	a	Okay .
14265	0	a	Yeah , I think this is just the preliminary , get some rough ideas for what our experiences with remote controls have been and and what we would roughly what we would incorporate into a new one maybe .
14266	0	a	Right , who is got experiences with remote controls then ?
14267	0	a	Pretty much everybody .
14268	0	a	Yeah .
14269	0	a	Yeah , I think we have all got
14270	0	a	Is this a TV one we are supposed to make ?
14271	0	a	Okay .
14272	0	a	Yeah .
14273	0	a	Yeah it is a TV remote control .
14274	0	a	Kay .
14275	0	a	Well .
14276	0	a	T
14277	0	a	But how do we know how much ,
14278	0	a	I mean , how much do we have per how much ?
14279	0	a	Twelve fifty .
14280	0	a	A new remote control for TV .
14281	0	a	What would I like ? .
14282	0	a	W what
14283	0	a	You want it big do you want it small .
14284	0	a	Medium .
14285	0	a	Are we are we going for like like
14286	0	a	telephones are going little teeny tiny things or we are going for something that is that is big and
14287	0	a	Video and ts hi fi and stuff .
14288	0	a	Yeah it seems like there is like there is sort of a tension between two ideas ,
14289	0	a	I mean , you want you want one remote that maybe can work all all of the functions of TV and if you have whatever associated with TV the DVD player , or something like that , but like at the same time you do not want to really busy remote with a thousand buttons on it or something .
14290	0	a	Maybe you
14291	0	a	yeah
14292	0	a	now th that is the other thing is it is gotta be cheap .
14293	0	a	Yeah .
14294	1	a	Cause I
14295	1	a	I
14296	1	a	I mean I was thinking something that is got different like maybe a a an LCD display on it that is got different pages for different devices ,
14297	0	a	but that would p that would probably be quite expensive .
14298	0	a	Twelve fifty .
14299	0	a	It g ca not be more than twelve fifty per unit .
14300	0	a	Each .
14301	0	a	Per unit , yeah .
14302	0	a	Cost .
14303	0	a	So do we have to be realistic within the budget or
14304	0	a	Close pr
14305	0	a	I do not know how much it would cost .
14306	0	a	Well at the moment we could , wa
14307	0	a	I mean we
14308	1	a	cause we this is what we th what we are doing at the moment is just saying what what we would like , and then after we after we have found out what we can like , some different ideas , we can then go and do the research to find out if these any of these ideas are feasible or not .
14309	0	a	Guess
14310	1	a	Could not we have like one that comes out ?
14311	0	a	Like so you have one in like
14312	1	a	it does not have to be really thick .
14313	0	a	Yeah .
14314	0	a	Right .
14315	1	a	So would be nice to have something that that controls lots of different things .
14316	0	a	Yeah .
14317	0	a	Yeah .
14318	0	a	I mean remote controls can be thin bits .
14319	1	a	And then you have one for your DVD and you sort of slide it out , and then you have another one , you slide it out .
14320	0	a	Kay .
14321	1	a	have slides .
14322	1	a	And then it all comes compact into one .
14323	0	a	Okay ,
14324	0	a	that is .
14325	0	a	So it is not
14326	0	a	you actually just putting three or four different remotes together but making them thinner , and into one basically .
14327	0	a	Th that is an idea .
14328	0	a	Yeah .
14329	0	a	So you just flip them out .
14330	0	a	Okay .
14331	1	a	have one very complicated one on one side with all the DVD and VCR access and stuff , and then on the other side o one a remote control that would be very very simple with just the channel , program plus and minus , and the just the mute button , for example .
14332	1	a	I can real keep it really really simple on one side and the other side be very complicated .
14333	0	a	One side for kids , one side for adults .
14334	0	a	Yeah .
14335	0	a	I am not sure if that is like
14336	0	a	I am not sure if it is a good idea to have a two sided remote though , cause it would be very hard to use in the way that you mani manipulate it .
14337	0	a	Or grandma as well , you know it is like what is the mute button .
14338	0	a	No , but you would slide it into someth like something on the back would hold like you would not be able to press the buttons , but
14339	1	a	Start breaking up .
14340	0	a	Oh .
14341	0	a	Oh okay .
14342	0	a	Like it
14343	1	a	or something like a flip telephone , something like that maybe .
14344	0	a	Yeah .
14345	0	a	Okay .
14346	0	a	That would be cool .
14347	0	a	I was thinking that like a flip .
14348	1	a	F flip it open and you have got all the buttons , or you flip it closed and you have just got the basic buttons on the outside maybe .
14349	0	a	, oh we have got five minutes left .
14350	0	a	Okay .
14351	0	a	But okay .
14352	0	a	Well we have got a k
14353	0	a	we have got a few ideas there .
14354	0	a	Yeah ,
14355	0	a	we should
14356	1	a	I guess by the end of this meeting we should have at least a a rough conception
14357	0	a	you know stage one was technical functions design , what effect the apparatus should have .
14358	0	a	Okay .
14359	0	a	so I mean we still have time in our next meeting to come up with the actual concept for the user interface , but the the functions that we are sure that we want are that it can control the TV , but also devices connected to the to the TV , I mean , be able to operate DVD players , things like that .
14360	0	a	Yeah .
14361	0	a	I have got
14362	1	a	I think we should also have a back up plan of I
14363	0	a	cause I
14364	0	a	I
14365	0	a	I just think that it might be expensive to make something that I mean we do not
14366	0	a	, we have not been told it has to be something that will control everything .
14367	0	a	Yeah .
14368	1	a	We should have a back up plan of just a really good television remote control , that just that is just for a TV , but it is just a really good , nice one .
14369	0	a	Yeah .
14370	0	a	Okay .
14371	0	a	Right .
14372	0	a	What do you reckon ?
14373	0	a	See cause , I am just thinking bearing in mind th
14374	0	a	we have gotta
14375	0	a	we have to have something that is cheap to make .
14376	0	a	Yeah ,
14377	0	a	I mean .
14378	0	a	Yeah , that is true ,
14379	1	a	maybe we should just concentrate on having a a good TV remote ,
14380	0	a	and have it be
14381	1	a	have it be like ergonomic so it is comfortable to use , simple to use , and looks decent and Sorta find a niche for our remote , like market it to a certain kind of p kind of people , certain certain demographic
14382	0	a	Yeah , no I think you are right .
14383	0	a	I think we will be able to come up with ideas and stuff a lot quicker .
14384	0	a	Yeah .
14385	0	a	May w you know , maybe even
14386	1	a	Or maybe even so something that is for disabled people or so people that b do not see very well or big buttons for touchy buttons for
14387	0	a	Yeah .
14388	1	a	But what will make it what will make it interesting for people to buy though ?
14389	0	a	I mean if it is if it is just like
14390	0	a	Yeah .
14391	1	a	Or just one that looks really fucking cool .
14392	1	a	Could be really light or , I dunno , something special .
14393	0	a	Yeah ,
14394	0	a	rathe rather than focus on Y
14395	0	a	Yeah .
14396	0	a	Otherwise we will be we will be here all day talking about
14397	0	a	do this let is do that
14398	0	a	n I think we sh
14399	0	a	I think we should
14400	0	a	Yeah .
14401	0	a	Yeah ,
14402	0	a	cause at the end of the day if it says just TV remote , does not say com combination with all all the r
14403	0	a	Yeah .
14404	0	a	I mean obviously everyone
14405	0	a	we are you know sounds like we are all a bit sort of gadget heads and
14406	0	a	we like things that do everything at once , but you know , that is
14407	0	a	Yeah .
14408	0	a	Remotes spinning out from other remotes and having little nested remotes inside .
14409	0	a	Yeah , that is right .
14410	0	a	Yeah .
14411	0	a	I mean I would like one that makes tea as well , but that is not going to happen .
14412	0	a	I think a flip up thing ,
14413	0	a	cause you always have this problem of like if it is on
14414	0	a	this well I did anyway ,
14415	0	a	like we had five or six remotes and they would be lying on the c on the coach , and you would come and sit down and
14416	0	a	ooh , the telephone is the television switched on or something .
14417	1	a	So maybe something that like does have a lid or closes ,
14418	0	a	so you do not accidentally press a button or record button for something .
14419	0	a	Okay ,
14420	1	a	like a lock f like a lock functs function on it like you have on your telephones ,
14421	0	a	yeah .
14422	0	a	Yeah .
14423	1	a	But make it like really snazzy and cool people will want it .
14424	0	a	So make it
14425	0	a	Yeah .
14426	0	a	Yeah , it is gotta be sellable .
14427	0	a	Yeah .
14428	0	a	Yeah .
14429	0	a	Yeah , that is true what you were saying ,
14430	0	a	I mean it does not have to have a flip function , it can just have a lock function ,
14431	0	a	so that it is not not usable when you do not want it to be usable .
14432	0	a	Yeah .
14433	0	a	Yeah .
14434	0	a	Okay .
14435	0	a	And even for kids as well .
14436	0	a	It is it is safer for them , I guess .
14437	0	a	Like they do not flick onto channels and all that sl flick onto .
14438	0	a	No porn channel for children .
14439	0	a	Okay .
14440	0	a	Okay .
14441	0	a	alright ,
14442	0	a	so we have got some ideas ,
14443	0	a	we have got
14444	1	a	Let is move on .
14445	0	a	I guess that is good good for now .
14446	0	a	Oops , let is close that .
14447	0	a	Next meeting , okay .
14448	0	a	W What does IDVIDNME stand for ?
14449	0	a	ri okay .
14450	0	a	Industrial Designer
14451	0	a	which is
14452	0	a	these are requirement specification .
14453	0	a	That is
14454	0	a	And I am marketing .
14455	0	a	Yeah ,
14456	0	a	there you go .
14457	0	a	So
14458	0	a	User Interface Designer , that is that is
14459	0	a	that is you ,
14460	0	a	so you gotta you go , you are you are going to be the one that is working out what what buttons we need .
14461	0	a	That is me .
14462	0	a	Okay .
14463	0	a	Right .
14464	0	a	Right .
14465	0	a	Industrial Designer , you are the one , you know , you are going to be working out kind of box it goes in
14466	0	a	, I guess so , whether it is what goes into the box , somehow .
14467	0	a	Har how it works an
14468	0	a	Bu
14469	0	a	Do you think our two kind of overlap , because
14470	0	a	Yeah .
14471	0	a	And in marketing User requirements specifications .
14472	0	a	These are requirement specification .
14473	0	a	So what the user requires in a remote .
14474	0	a	Yeah ,
14475	0	a	what
14476	0	a	Right , okay
14477	0	a	, yeah .
14478	0	a	Yeah , it does seem like our our responsibilities have some overlap .
14479	0	a	I guess that is what it says .
14480	1	a	You two you two are going to be just , I think , you just double up , you know , you working together .
14481	0	a	Yeah .
14482	0	a	You are the one that is gotta go and find out do th do the research , see what people want in a remote , what buttons are used more often , and s stuff like that .
14483	0	a	Oh , we have been warned to finish the meeting now .
14484	0	a	Okay .
14485	0	a	Okay everyone , well done .
14486	0	a	Good meeting .

14573	0	a	are you b are you joining in with this meeting here
14574	0	a	or are y or are y or are you are you just are you just doing some Internet shopping there ?
14575	0	a	Okay , jolly good .
14576	0	a	I am fine .
14577	0	a	Yeah .
14578	0	a	I
14579	0	a	yeah ,
14580	0	a	yeah .
14581	0	a	Think she is finishing up her presentation .
14582	0	a	D
14583	0	a	I mean , I I am finishing off my presentation .
14584	0	a	No no .
14585	0	a	I am done .
14586	0	a	Okay .
14587	0	a	Alright , let is have
14588	0	a	well , we all know that it is it is a remote control that we are going to be dealing with .
14589	0	a	I think the first thing we should look at is probably the what it is that it is actually supposed to be .
14590	0	a	So that is going to be you Catherine ,
14591	1	a	if we want to hear from you first .
14592	0	a	Okay .
14593	1	a	Okay .
14594	0	a	just connecting this .
14595	0	a	Are we getting i
14596	0	a	Really ?
14597	0	a	Okay .
14598	0	a	You do not have to worry about screwing it in just
14599	0	a	there you go .
14600	0	a	Cool .
14601	0	a	Okay .
14602	0	a	So I have got a very quick
14603	0	a	Okay .
14604	0	a	So the working design , I have got a very quick presentation on this ,
14605	0	a	so I have
14606	0	a	oh no ,
14607	0	a	you ca not see a thing .
14608	0	a	Oh well ,
14609	1	a	I am going to draw it on the board then .
14610	0	a	It is in blue , and I could not change it .
14611	0	a	Oh .
14612	0	a	We it is fine on my screen ,
14613	0	a	but never mind .
14614	0	a	So the idea is that we have got the energy source ,
14615	0	a	which in our case will pr ,
14616	0	a	oh well okay , never mind .
14617	0	a	So I think maybe two batteries , I dunno what they are called six , or something like that .
14618	0	a	and then
14619	0	a	then on the remote control itself will have the sender for the signal , which could be an infra red signal , which will be sent by an electronic chip .
14620	0	a	And the chip will be controlled by the user interface .
14621	0	a	So we will hear about that later from Gabriel .
14622	0	a	And the sender will send to the telly itself an infra red signal to tell it to switch on or switch channels .
14623	0	a	and that is it really for the working design .
14624	0	a	Great .
14625	0	a	Okay .
14626	0	a	Sorry
14627	0	a	the presentation was not very clear but
14628	0	a	Really ?
14629	0	a	Cool .
14630	0	a	I prefer the pe
14631	0	a	I prefer the human touch personally .
14632	0	a	Yeah .
14633	0	a	, should I erase this or
14634	0	a	Okay .
14635	1	a	Do you want to just give us a moment ,
14636	1	a	I just want to copy this down .
14637	0	a	I dunno if you guys have got any questions for Catherine on any of this ?
14638	0	a	Yeah , you blow on it and i
14639	0	a	Yeah ,
14640	0	a	it is worked for the last fifty years you know .
14641	0	a	Fine .
14642	1	a	Or suggestions ?
14643	0	a	Well , it is just , you do not want it plugged in really , s
14644	0	a	In indoors .
14645	0	a	Is a battery like the only way of
14646	0	a	No , no
14647	0	a	No I meant like No cause like cha cause always changing batteries can get like annoying .
14648	0	a	Yeah , alternate energy source , like win wind power or Bicycle power .
14649	0	a	The battery is down and
14650	1	a	maybe , I dunno , solar charged ?
14651	0	a	I dunno ,
14652	0	a	swi I th
14653	0	a	I th
14654	0	a	I think changing your batteries once every six months is not really a pain , but
14655	0	a	Yeah .
14656	0	a	Yeah .
14657	1	a	One question I have ,
14658	0	a	and I do not know how much control we have over this is ,
14659	0	a	as far as the infra red signal , do we have control over , you know , how far away you can be from the receiving unit , the the TV , and still have it be operational ?
14660	1	a	I mean , maybe we want one with a strong signal stream .
14661	0	a	How far away is your television ?
14662	0	a	It is never going to be more than it is never going to be , you kno unless you have got a TV the size of a football pitch , it is not does not have to go that far ,
14663	0	a	does it ?
14664	0	a	Does not have to go through a wall , because you are not going to be looking through a wall .
14665	0	a	That is true .
14666	0	a	Well , the thing is you you do not
14667	1	a	Well , we can make the the signal strong enough to go through walls if if you fancy it .
14668	0	a	Yeah , but if like you are on the phone in the other room and you need turn television off or something
14669	0	a	and you do not really want to go into the put the telephone down , and go into the other room .
14670	0	a	I did not think about that
14671	0	a	but
14672	0	a	Why not ?
14673	0	a	I just think that it is it is going to cost more
14674	0	a	and I am I am not sure it is you are going to use it .
14675	1	a	How about Bluetooth ?
14676	1	a	Instead of using infra red , use Bluetooth .
14677	0	a	Is not that a better signal ?
14678	0	a	Yeah ,
14679	0	a	yeah
14680	0	a	I d
14681	0	a	it sounds like you you w do not want to overcomplicate things .
14682	0	a	You know we do not need it .
14683	0	a	It is a fancy idea it is quite nice , but then I do not th I dunno ,
14684	0	a	either you if you want to watch the telly you are in the room ,
14685	0	a	you are going to But
14686	1	a	Oh , we can we can keep the idea
14687	1	a	if you i We can see at a later stage , maybe , I do not
14688	0	a	Do you need the border ?
14689	0	a	Okay .
14690	0	a	Yeah , exactly .
14691	0	a	Basically , we are we are desi we are designing and marketing a television remote control unit .
14692	0	a	We are not w w w w designing something that you can plug in a headset to and and you know connect to your laptop computer and stuff .
14693	0	a	It is
14694	0	a	Okay .
14695	0	a	Is just an idea .
14696	0	a	Right , well done , Catherine .
14697	1	a	Gab Gabriel let is let is hear from you on on on such things .
14698	1	a	Okay .
14699	1	a	I am just going to use the PowerPoint .
14700	0	a	Sorry .
14701	0	a	Technical .
14702	0	a	Okay .
14703	0	a	Adjusting .
14704	0	a	Okay , so , while this is warming up , there it is .
14705	0	a	Yeah .
14706	0	a	So I am doing the user interface design .
14707	0	a	Yeah , and basically , as far as methods , I was I was looking looking at looking at already existing remotes , trying to find some inspiration from designs that are already out there .
14708	0	a	Thinking of what we can retain , what we can do away with , what we what we can perfect a little bit as far as design .
14709	1	a	we do not want to do something that is too radical of a change , I guess ,
14710	0	a	I mean people want a remote that is familiar , that has their favourite functionalities and and does the basics , but
14711	1	a	so we can improve what is out there and maintain that , the basic functionality that people want .
14712	0	a	yeah .
14713	0	a	so things that seem like absolute must haves would be a volume control , so up down keys for that , channel keys up down , but then also a numerical key pad so that they can just key directly to the channel that they want , rather than doing up down , and a mute button .
14714	0	a	one thing that I did not include here , that I forgot that we talked about last time , was doing some sort of lock function .
14715	0	a	, I do not I dunno , that is one possibility .
14716	0	a	Okay .
14717	0	a	And so in the research that I was doing there is basically two types of remotes , ones that are engineering centred and ones that are more user centred , which I do not know if I can access the web page from here ,
14718	1	a	but I can show you .
14719	0	a	Yeah .
14720	0	a	So this is a engineer centred one , so you see it is rather busy , but it also lets you play your movie , stop your movie , fast forward , all this , freeze frame .
14721	0	a	and this is a user centred one .
14722	0	a	it is it is easier to g just glance at this and see what is possible to do
14723	0	a	, you are not going to be staring at it for five minutes .
14724	0	a	Yeah .
14725	0	a	Great .
14726	0	a	And I
14727	0	a	judging from what what we all talked about during our last meeting I kind of gathered that that is what we were going after , or the direction we were going in at least .
14728	0	a	So , the engineering centred ones provide a lot of functionality , but it can be a little bit overwhelming , so the user centred ones just focus on ease of use .
14729	0	a	and this sort of overlaps with what the marketing person , Reissa ,
14730	1	a	because we we need to find out what what people want before we make firm decisions on this .
14731	0	a	Yeah .
14732	0	a	So , yeah , that is me .
14733	0	a	Great .
14734	0	a	Okay .
14735	1	a	Now that is I just have a q a q question for you .
14736	0	a	This w research that you have been doing looki looking at other , you know , existing units stuff .
14737	0	a	have you found that anyone else has do has looked into the locking function or
14738	0	a	Yeah .
14739	0	a	No that that that seemed like a novel idea as f as far as I know .
14740	0	a	I mean obviously another exists like you like you said in in mobile phones .
14741	0	a	That was sort of the inspiration for it .
14742	0	a	I have never seen that with in in all my years in in the remote business .
14743	0	a	Yeah .
14744	0	a	I have , have not I have never seen a locking functionality .
14745	0	a	I dunno ,
14746	0	a	what do you guys have a a yea or nay on that a feeling about whether that is really necessary ?
14747	0	a	Yeah .
14748	0	a	I would say it is If it is simple to do , which I think it probably should be , even if it is a physical , you know , a f a like a f a physical switch or a physical cover for the remote , even something like that , then yes , it is like , you know , like s you said earlier on ab ab ab a flip thing , something like that , but you know being physical .
14749	0	a	Kay .
14750	0	a	Right .
14751	1	a	Look into .
14752	0	a	I have had word down from head office that something that we should be centred well , something we should take into account is we have gotta keep the corporate image within this remote control unit .
14753	0	a	It is gotta d look like it is in the R and R .
14754	0	a	You know , the the company it is it is , from what I can see from our other products , are yellow with blue writing on them .
14755	0	a	Right .
14756	0	a	And our motto is is we put the fashion in electronics .
14757	0	a	We put the fashion in electronics .
14758	1	a	I think I think we have to carry that mental .
14759	0	a	There you go .
14760	0	a	So it is kind of gotta look it is gotta look new
14761	0	a	and s you know something fashionable .
14762	0	a	If if remote control well , if telephones can be fashionable , then maybe remote control units can be .
14763	0	a	Well yeah
14764	0	a	these , I think , we can
14765	0	a	so we talked about the layout in my presentation and what I did not mention yet really is is the sort of like the ergonomic design .
14766	0	a	Yeah .
14767	0	a	Because we need
14768	0	a	Yeah .
14769	0	a	I t I think we can make big improvements over these two that you see here , I mean .
14770	0	a	, everything is going t ergonomic , you know , there is you know mice for your computers that are very ergonomic and keyboards
14771	1	a	and that could be one of our niches p sort of in the market , I guess .
14772	0	a	Great .
14773	0	a	Okay , fantastic .
14774	0	a	Right , well done , Gabriel .
14775	0	a	Okay .
14776	1	a	Reissa .
14777	0	a	Where does it go into ?
14778	0	a	Here ?
14779	0	a	The blue thing .
14780	1	a	Let is plug you in , baby .
14781	0	a	Yeah .
14782	0	a	, yeah , this is getting all .
14783	0	a	Yeah , then you just have to do function F eight and it should come up .
14784	0	a	Well , function F eight .
14785	0	a	No oh .
14786	0	a	Yeah , w it it just takes a wee while .
14787	0	a	Yeah , it just takes a second .
14788	0	a	Come on .
14789	0	a	Right .
14790	0	a	Okay .
14791	0	a	Okay .
14792	0	a	Well , for our marketing report we observed remote control users in a usability lab ,
14793	0	a	and also gave
14794	0	a	so this is research and we also gave participants questionnaires to fill out .
14795	0	a	total number of people tested were a hundred just so you know , so that hundred people were tested and these were the findings .
14796	0	a	So seventy five per cent of users find the remote control ugly .
14797	0	a	Okay , so they do not like the look of the remote control .
14798	0	a	eighty f eighty per cent of them would spend more money if the rem remote control looked really cool and fancy .
14799	0	a	So I think we all agree with that .
14800	0	a	current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user .
14801	0	a	So , they do not like like the way they operate it
14802	0	a	does not like match how people behave .
14803	0	a	per cent of the users say that they only use ten per cent of the buttons on a remote , so probably if you have like one , two , three , four , five , the whole up to z ten , they probably do not use those , they only use the up and down channel .
14804	0	a	Cause we have only got five channels .
14805	0	a	exactly .
14806	0	a	That is another thing .
14807	0	a	seventy five per cent of users say they zap .
14808	0	a	Not quite sure what they mean , zap , goes like .
14809	0	a	I think that is k flicking quickly between channels .
14810	0	a	Yeah ,
14811	0	a	you want to navigate the channels quickly I guess .
14812	0	a	Yeah .
14813	0	a	Yeah .
14814	0	a	takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote .
14815	0	a	I think especially for the older generation .
14816	0	a	I know my grandmother does not like mobile phones , takes ages to work how to use .
14817	0	a	Anyway
14818	0	a	and they also remotes often get lost in the room , so nobody can find them .
14819	1	a	So maybe tracking devices is a good idea .
14820	0	a	personal preferences .
14821	0	a	Wow .
14822	0	a	You are a child of technology , are not you ?
14823	0	a	So there you go , yeah .
14824	0	a	so yeah
14825	1	a	I was thinking something easy to use , especially for older people .
14826	1	a	has to look really cool , flashy groovy for people to buy it .
14827	1	a	And it is easy to find ,
14828	0	a	so I do not know whether maybe
14829	0	a	and also we asked them whether they wanted whether they would be interested in voice activating .
14830	0	a	So voice activation .
14831	0	a	So and this was what we came up with .
14832	0	a	Then if you look fifteen to twenty five this is age , sorry , age groups .
14833	0	a	So fifteen to twenty five said like ninety two ninety one per cent of them said yes .
14834	0	a	so basically the majority except for the forty five to fifty five year olds for some reason did not want a voice activated one .
14835	0	a	And neither did the older generation , but the younger generation who we are catering for , like who have most of the money nowadays , do want a voice act speech recognition in a remote .
14836	0	a	but do the younger generation have the money ?
14837	0	a	They they do not .
14838	0	a	No I would I would say the older the older people , yeah .
14839	0	a	It is older generation , they are the ones that have gone out and People people from the age of thirty f there is a big drop off there .
14840	0	a	Well the twenty five to thirty five year old , and thirty five , and the thirty five to forty five , forty five
14841	0	a	point seven per cent say no , so
14842	0	a	So they do not
14843	0	a	Well These guys are growing up .
14844	0	a	For people up to the age of thirty five , you are kind of saying , yeah
14845	0	a	, they want it .
14846	0	a	but no they are not sort of
14847	0	a	most people that have the money are people from the age of thirty five to fifty five , cause they are the ones that have been working for twenty years .
14848	0	a	Yeah , that would be my guess as well .
14849	0	a	d and tha
14850	0	a	and that is a that is quite a minority there ,
14851	0	a	so yeah , it is not even like fifty fifty that is th thirty five per cent .
14852	0	a	What about just from the the prospective of our manufacturing cost ?
14853	0	a	I mean if if it is twelve fifty per unit .
14854	0	a	Yeah .
14855	0	a	I mean , okay , there is
14856	0	a	Voice activation might not be the best .
14857	1	a	I would say scra I would say scrap that straight off .
14858	0	a	also with with buttons , a thing called RSI , so wrist sense
14859	0	a	Huh ?
14860	0	a	Yeah , repetitive strains injury ,
14861	0	a	so they do not
14862	0	a	I think people who watch TV maybe too often , keep changing channel hurts their wrist .
14863	0	a	Repetitive strain rep repetitive strain injury
14864	0	a	or like from doing
14865	0	a	I do not think so .
14866	0	a	Well maybe they should not watch so much TV then .
14867	0	a	So y so it is so it is so you got
14868	1	a	so that is something we should have a look into then i when desi when designing the ergonomics of
14869	0	a	see
14870	1	a	have a look if there is any w any medical background we can find out about this .
14871	0	a	Yeah
14872	1	a	maybe not so hard .
14873	1	a	Maybe it could be , instead of pressing button it could be just touching a
14874	0	a	Yep .
14875	0	a	Yeah .
14876	0	a	Let is jus
14877	0	a	we just want need to cover our arses so that people are not going to sue us in ten years' time , say your remote control gave me repetitive strain injury .
14878	0	a	Maybe
14879	0	a	Yeah ,
14880	1	a	we should probably consult with our legal department .
14881	0	a	Yeah .
14882	0	a	They are having a lunch break at the moment , but
14883	0	a	yeah .
14884	0	a	Yeah .
14885	0	a	I will see if I can get see if I can get hold of them for the next meeting .
14886	0	a	Yeah .
14887	0	a	I think we can do some really in in that department , the the ergonomic department , we can make some some really good improvements .
14888	0	a	Yeah .
14889	1	a	Maybe th the buttons not so high up so you do not have to press so much , or we just like flat buttons , something .
14890	0	a	Yeah .
14891	0	a	Okay .
14892	0	a	So that is me .
14893	0	a	That is great ,
14894	0	a	thank you very much for that , Reissa .
14895	0	a	okay , so we have basically
14896	0	a	we have decide we have d
14897	0	a	we have decided that it is going to be , you know , we are going for a basic television remote .
14898	0	a	It is gotta be safe to use , it is gotta look cool .
14899	0	a	It is gotta be cheap .
14900	0	a	S .
14901	1	a	Now going back to the industrial design of it ,
14902	0	a	you know , we were looking at whether to use maybe infra red or Bluetooth .
14903	1	a	I think , we should just go with the simplest option on everything ,
14904	0	a	and that would be infra red , energy source , that would be batteries .
14905	1	a	mean we we can look into using the s , you know , the little tiny weeny batteries , all like special long lasting batteries .
14906	0	a	But a in there is no
14907	0	a	I do not think there is any point in making a remote control unit that is going to last for fifty years ,
14908	0	a	because technology will have changed and , you know , we wo not have televisions in ten years' time .
14909	0	a	So
14910	0	a	I think we are all pretty sussed on that .
14911	0	a	anyone have any questions ?
14912	0	a	Everybody happy in their work ?
14913	0	a	Now this is good , we have got a good structure going on .
14914	0	a	Yeah , it seems like we are all on the pretty much on the same page .
14915	0	a	We all know where we are going to .
14916	0	a	Have you been ge has
14917	0	a	have any of you lot been getting loads of crap spam on your computers ?
14918	0	a	Yeah .
14919	0	a	Oh it is probably just you , cause you are the project manager .
14920	0	a	Well , just questionnaires .
14921	0	a	Sell trying to sell your things .
14922	0	a	Yeah , stuff .
14923	0	a	okay .
14924	0	a	Do
14925	0	a	oh have you guys found out if we can if we can e mail stuff to each other ?
14926	0	a	Right .
14927	0	a	Yeah , you can .
14928	0	a	Okay .
14929	0	a	Do all you all know my e mail address ?
14930	0	a	Can you all d e mail me your e mail addresses ?
14931	0	a	No I do not .
14932	0	a	I think he is participant one ,
14933	0	a	are not you ?
14934	1	a	Ca not we have different colours in the remotes ,
14935	0	a	so somebody can choose different col
14936	0	a	like does it have to be of a certain ?
14937	0	a	But if it is a RR , it would be Real Reaction , like if it had a symbol on it .
14938	0	a	Well , in the project announcement , you have got the addresses , I think .
14939	0	a	I
14940	0	a	Oh , it is just participant one
14941	0	a	oh okay .
14942	0	a	So Project Manager , it is participant one at AMI .
14943	0	a	Yeah .
14944	0	a	Well it is just w
14945	0	a	it is just
14946	0	a	it is just par participant one , participant two .
14947	0	a	You have them
14948	0	a	i you have them ,
14949	1	a	but we will send you an e mail .
14950	0	a	Send me , yeah
14951	0	a	yeah ,
14952	0	a	okay .
14953	0	a	You want to have friends , do not you ?
14954	0	a	It would not be
14955	0	a	Well you could It could come
14956	1	a	But it could come in different colours and have the RR colours just somewhere like just around the lock button could be the RR logo or colours and
14957	0	a	If .
14958	0	a	So are we headed towards like a b a big yellow and black remote as far as
14959	1	a	maybe that is our next meeting that we discuss that .
14960	0	a	Is it yellow and black or is it yellow and blue ?
14961	0	a	I I kind of thought it was blue writing on a yellow background ,
14962	0	a	but I might be just going a bit
14963	0	a	Okay .
14964	0	a	Well , it is like white on i white and blue on a black background with white with yellow borders .
14965	0	a	Maybe that is like getting ahead of ourselves .
14966	0	a	Well ,
14967	1	a	maybe you can come up with a few with a couple of different ideas ?
14968	0	a	Well , see the thing is is we have gotta keep the company image .
14969	0	a	It is gotta say
14970	0	a	people have gotta look at this remote control and instantly recognise that it is a Real Reaction i product .
14971	0	a	There is loads of companies that called RR .
14972	0	a	Whoa .
14973	0	a	This is slog but this is the slogan , this is the the the the type .
14974	0	a	And this is something that came on down from from the higher ups , so , I mean , we are sort of beholden to them .
14975	0	a	Yeah .
14976	0	a	So we have to have it one colour .
14977	0	a	Well , not necessarily .
14978	0	a	Not one colour , but the pattern needs to be recognisable .
14979	0	a	But we have to incorporate it .
14980	0	a	Not necessarily even if i it just has to
14981	0	a	but you have to look at the product and instantly know that it is one of our products as opposed to a Sony product or a , you know , a Panasonic product .
14982	0	a	It is got to
14983	1	a	so maybe , so you can have a look at our our other products and see if they all follow a s similar vein , perhaps .
14984	0	a	Yeah .
14985	0	a	Yeah .
14986	0	a	Quite poss
14987	0	a	yeah .
14988	0	a	Well this is all your department .
14989	0	a	okay .
14990	0	a	Well , well done everybody .
14991	0	a	And , I think we stop for lunch now .
14992	0	a	Yeah , pretty soon I think ,
14993	0	a	I guess that is now .
14994	0	a	Are we are we finished ahead of schedule ?
14995	0	a	We might possibly have done .
14996	0	a	If we have if we have finished at five minutes before the meeting is supposed to finish , then that means we get an extra five minutes for lunch .
14997	0	a	Yeah , there you go .
14998	0	a	Right .
14999	0	a	I just have to there is a few little bits and pieces I have to write down , but
15000	0	a	 
15001	0	a	Oh right
15002	0	a	okay .
15003	0	a	I cover myself up .
15004	0	a	I feel like Madonna with one of these on .
15005	0	a	I said I feel like Madonna with one of these on .
15006	0	a	I have always wanted one of these , I really have .
15007	0	a	Where do you buy them from ?
15008	0	a	They are .
15009	0	a	Right .
15010	0	a	Hello everybody .
15011	0	a	Hello .
15012	0	a	Back again for another wonderful meeting .
15013	0	a	Is everyone ready ?
15014	0	a	Okay ,
15015	1	a	we c we can hold on for a minute .
15016	0	a	Yeah .
15017	0	a	Yeah .
15018	0	a	Almost .
15019	0	a	Oh my gosh .
15020	0	a	I figured with the spam thing , if you ca not beat it , join in .
15021	0	a	That is the kind of spam that everybody likes to receive .
15022	0	a	kay .
15023	0	a	Are you ready ?
15024	0	a	Okay , right , well ,
15025	0	a	I take it that you are all ready now .
15026	1	a	alright first off we will just recap from our last meeting .
15027	0	a	which was we got together just to basically decide on well to talk about what it is that we were actually supposed to be doing , and who we all are and stuff like that , get bit more of an idea together of what is going on .
15028	0	a	what we are going to talk about in this meeting is now that we know what it is that we are doing , now we know that it is a TV remote and stuff
15029	0	a	and you guys have just been off doing some some R and D for that ,
15030	0	a	that is research and development for those that have not heard that before , see I am learning all sorts of new technologi terms in technology today .
15031	0	a	yeah , we are going to hear your th three little presentations , whether they be on computer or on the whiteboard or whatever you want .
15032	1	a	Do you have any preference of order ?
15033	0	a	I think she is still finishing her .
15034	0	a	I would like to hear
15035	1	a	o I would like to hear who is g who is on the from from Catherine actually first .
15036	0	a	I want
15037	1	a	what I would like to hear about is if we have finally decided on what sort of energy we are going to be using and
15038	0	a	It is just that
15039	1	a	yeah , let is let is hear from you first .
15040	0	a	Batteries .
15041	0	a	No no no
15042	0	a	no , it is fine
15043	0	a	I am just preparing .
15044	1	a	Okay .
15045	0	a	Where is that thing ?
15046	0	a	Oh sorry , could not see .
15047	0	a	Okay , it is
15048	0	a	Is it like a crank thing or something .
15049	0	a	It is here .
15050	0	a	Would that work ?
15051	1	a	Okay , so that is me again .
15052	1	a	Get yourself in position .
15053	0	a	so for the energy sources we can have a basic battery , a hand dynamo which is which was used in the fifties for torches , if you remember that kind of
15054	0	a	which would not be v would not be v v
15055	0	a	yeah ,
15056	0	a	yeah .
15057	0	a	I do not think any of us remember the fifties .
15058	0	a	It would not be very fancy .
15059	0	a	You can have a kinetic provision of energy , which is used on some watches these days .
15060	0	a	So if you have just a bit of gentle movement that it will give it the energy to work .
15061	0	a	Or you can use solar cells ,
15062	0	a	but I am not sure about that indoors , really , but
15063	0	a	Yeah .
15064	0	a	Well , there is sometimes combinations ,
15065	0	a	I mean , like calculators do combinations of battery with but also using some solar power .
15066	0	a	Do sol solar panel things , do they have to work from the sun or can they work from a light bulb ?
15067	0	a	Does anybody know ?
15068	0	a	Okay .
15069	0	a	I dunno actually .
15070	0	a	I think , it has to be on the on the solar energy , but I do not know .
15071	0	a	I dunno .
15072	0	a	Think the the what would cost the less would be the basic battery , really .
15073	0	a	And if we want something fancier , I think the kinetic provision of energy could be nice , but I do not know if it is worth the cost .
15074	1	a	So we have got to discuss that .
15075	0	a	Okay , jolly good .
15076	0	a	For the case of the remotes itself , they can be a general case , which is just a flat one .
15077	0	a	You can have a curved one or a double curved one ,
15078	0	a	if you know what I mean , so
15079	0	a	You know , kind of more ergonomic , that kind of suits the palm of your hand , that kind of thing .
15080	0	a	What is a double curved one ?
15081	0	a	Okay .
15082	0	a	So
15083	0	a	then the case material itself , so it can be either plastic or latex , rubber , wood , or titanium .
15084	0	a	And th for each of them you have cases where for example titanium , you ca not use it for if you if we are choosing a double curved case , we ca not choose titanium .
15085	0	a	And if we are choosing solar cells then we ca not choose latex for the case material ,
15086	1	a	so we just have to take that into account .
15087	0	a	But if we are choosing just the flat case then we can go for anything .
15088	1	a	And I think we discussed earlier on the R S
15089	1	a	I problem thing , so
15090	1	a	we could
15091	0	a	Yeah .
15092	1	a	So that might be an idea of using the rubber ,
15093	0	a	but then it should , you know
15094	0	a	yeah .
15095	1	a	Let is have a squeezable remote .
15096	0	a	Yeah .
15097	0	a	And also it does not break as easily maybe ,
15098	0	a	I dunno
15099	0	a	So rubber would be Okay .
15100	0	a	when a TV programme is got one
15101	0	a	watching the match and your team is just lost , you can fuzz it across the room and it will bounce off the wall back at you .
15102	0	a	Yeah .
15103	0	a	Yeah , I like that idea .
15104	0	a	I think rubber is
15105	0	a	But after my after my fashion thing , I think you will realise that rubber is more
15106	0	a	People .
15107	0	a	Rubber , we are all we are all going we are all liking that idea ?
15108	0	a	You think you can market that ?
15109	0	a	Ooh , we like rubber , ooh .
15110	0	a	s so
15111	0	a	if d
15112	0	a	okay .
15113	0	a	And then there are the push buttons , so you can have basic push buttons or a scroll wheels , like you have on a mouse , or you could have LCD , which gives you a display .
15114	0	a	scroll buttons , as well .
15115	0	a	Uh huh .
15116	0	a	So if you use a rubber double curved case , you must use rubber push buttons .
15117	0	a	So if we are going for rubber then we have to decide for the case .
15118	0	a	and if we choose double curved then we have to go for rubber push buttons .
15119	0	a	So it is a constraint .
15120	0	a	Well , we are going to go with
15121	0	a	I think we have decided that it is going to be a rubber case so
15122	0	a	push buttons instead of the wheel ?
15123	0	a	rubble double double .
15124	0	a	Yeah , but is it a double curved one or not ?
15125	0	a	If it is not a double curved , then we have got the choice for the push buttons , if it is a double curve , we have gotta go for rubber push buttons .
15126	0	a	If that makes sense .
15127	0	a	Yeah .
15128	0	a	If it is rubber , is not it malleable anyway ,
15129	0	a	it does not matter if it is double
15130	0	a	I mean is not a rubber case ,
15131	0	a	mean it is completely flexed , I mean ,
15132	0	a	it it flexes to whatever they want it to ?
15133	0	a	Mean
15134	0	a	so what is the difference between a normal rubber case and a rubble doub double rubber double curved case ?
15135	0	a	Okay .
15136	0	a	No ,
15137	0	a	but na le you see , you have got , okay , the energy that is one thing , then you have the case is , whether it is flat or curved .
15138	0	a	I will have a Big Mac , please .
15139	0	a	And that is
15140	0	a	we do not care if it is rub rubber or not , but then we have decided that we going for rubber for the case material .
15141	0	a	So if we have chosen rub rubber and if now we have the choice for the case whether it is flat , single curved or double curved .
15142	0	a	And I am just saying if it if we choose it to be double curved then we need to go I dunno why , but we need to go for rubber push buttons .
15143	0	a	So , either
15144	0	a	I dunno
15145	1	a	we just need to decide on the on the case .
15146	1	a	Let is have rubber push buttons , hey .
15147	0	a	Okay .
15148	0	a	Go rubber .
15149	0	a	Go rubber the whole way .
15150	0	a	Let is go crazy .
15151	0	a	And then , do I have a last slide ?
15152	0	a	Yes , I do .
15153	0	a	so the push buttons themselves they can be just simple or they can be so that is just the electronics between the but behind the push buttons .
15154	0	a	Yeah .
15155	0	a	and the price that go with it with it , so the simple push buttons are going to be the cheapest .
15156	0	a	if we get a scroll wheel , that is a higher price range .
15157	0	a	If we get an advanced chip which is used for the LCD , the display thing , then that is even more expensive .
15158	0	a	Simple , yeah .
15159	0	a	Chip on print .
15160	0	a	It is a bit .
15161	0	a	Okay , what I am not understanding here
15162	0	a	is , okay , advanced chip on print , which I presume is like one PCB and that is got all the electronics on one board including the infra red sender ?
15163	0	a	Right .
15164	0	a	Yeah .
15165	0	a	The infra red .
15166	0	a	Yeah .
15167	0	a	what a what alternatives do we have to that ?
15168	0	a	Y
15169	0	a	what alternatives do we have to the chip on print ?
15170	0	a	so it sounds
15171	0	a	So , why would we not go for that ?
15172	0	a	If it is something that is inside the the unit .
15173	0	a	Well , if if it is not chip on print then , I guess , you get different chip components , and you build them separately and does not include the infra red .
15174	0	a	It is less expensive Technically speaking , it is not as advanced , but it does the job , too .
15175	0	a	Fo
15176	0	a	It does not , yeah ,
15177	0	a	yeah ,
15178	0	a	yeah .
15179	0	a	I it does not affects whether the customer is going to buy it or not .
15180	0	a	Totally .
15181	0	a	Yeah .
15182	0	a	we want to go for an i i all
15183	0	a	so long as it works ,
15184	0	a	you know .
15185	1	a	So let is not go for the
15186	0	a	Yeah ,
15187	0	a	yeah .
15188	0	a	I agree .
15189	1	a	So let is not let is not bother with the chip on print .
15190	0	a	So it is either the scroll wheel or the push buttons .
15191	0	a	Yeah .
15192	0	a	S
15193	0	a	yeah ,
15194	0	a	push buttons .
15195	0	a	What about the just developed sample sensor ?
15196	0	a	G there , the sample sensor , sample speaker thing .
15197	0	a	I think push buttons is
15198	0	a	Yeah .
15199	0	a	What about what ?
15200	0	a	Well , what do we need a speaker for in a remote control unit ?
15201	0	a	S
15202	0	a	Yeah .
15203	0	a	Well
15204	0	a	It would be it would be cool , but they are saying they have just developed it ,
15205	0	a	I am just guessing .
15206	0	a	, I dunno .
15207	0	a	Be cool .
15208	0	a	Channel two .
15209	0	a	But it is going to be the most expensive option , probably and
15210	0	a	Hm .
15211	0	a	Th the the speech recognition option is it does not seem really very promising for us ,
15212	0	a	cause
15213	0	a	The yeah the example that they are already using it for is with the coffee machine , where , basically , you can program a sample wi That when you say something it will give a response , and you program the response as well .
15214	1	a	It is not something that we want to t go into with this product .
15215	0	a	Just clips of tha that you record yourself .
15216	0	a	So you can program your coffee maker that when you say , good morning , to it it says , hello Rick , or whatever .
15217	0	a	Yeah .
15218	0	a	But , I mean , it is not
15219	0	a	it would be one thing if it was speech recognition where you say something
15220	0	a	and it turns the TV on like , turn the TV on , and i turns comes on ,
15221	0	a	but it is not that .
15222	0	a	It just gives you
15223	0	a	a it just gives you a verbal response .
15224	0	a	Oh , it just gives an answer .
15225	0	a	So , yeah , I mean , like what is the point of saying ,
15226	0	a	Hello remote , I mean , hello , how how are you ?
15227	0	a	Yeah , if you are really lonely , it is it is
15228	0	a	No ,
15229	0	a	tha that w that w that would be more promising .
15230	0	a	Oh , then then I thought I thought it was when they said
15231	0	a	I thought when they said , voice recognition , they meant like , channel five , and it will change .
15232	0	a	Yeah .
15233	0	a	Yeah .
15234	0	a	Just if you are really lonely , maybe .
15235	0	a	Channel five .
15236	0	a	And then it switches on .
15237	0	a	Like you talk to it .
15238	0	a	Can I have channel five ?
15239	0	a	Oh , then forget about it .
15240	0	a	Yeah .
15241	0	a	It it is just a remote that talks to you .
15242	0	a	Yeah .
15243	0	a	Yeah .
15244	0	a	Oh right
15245	0	a	okay .
15246	0	a	I mean to certain cues .
15247	0	a	Yeah .
15248	1	a	Okay , so I will go back , maybe , to the previous slide
15249	1	a	and we can decide for each problem , what we should choose .
15250	0	a	So for the energy source , do we go for the battery or the
15251	0	a	Cheaper option .
15252	0	a	Kay .
15253	0	a	Yeah , I am fine with the basic battery .
15254	0	a	Basic battery .
15255	0	a	It is cheap , it is cheerful , it is worked , does work .
15256	0	a	Are you happy with that ?
15257	1	a	Okay .
15258	0	a	Yeah .
15259	1	a	So we will go for the battery .
15260	0	a	Then the case , do you want it flat or curved or sing or double curved ?
15261	0	a	Double ?
15262	0	a	Okay , so then if we use double curved case , then we have to u choose rubber push buttons ,
15263	0	a	and that is fine ?
15264	0	a	P
15265	0	a	Yeah .
15266	0	a	We were go we were going with the late with the the RSI rubber , were not we ?
15267	0	a	The the
15268	0	a	The double whopper , please .
15269	0	a	Yeah ,
15270	0	a	so we want it rub rubber double curved .
15271	0	a	So it will look like something like this .
15272	0	a	Yep ,
15273	0	a	but
15274	1	a	we are going for the simple buttons .
15275	0	a	So rubber rubber keys , yeah .
15276	0	a	Yeah .
15277	0	a	And it is cheapest all round ,
15278	0	a	it sounds kind of funky , and we can also market it
15279	0	a	as i cause we were s saying earl
15280	0	a	you were saying earlier in your research that the the people have the R people were getting the complaining about RSI , and this is anti RSI .
15281	0	a	Yeah .
15282	0	a	Yeah .
15283	0	a	So that is another marketing point that we can use .
15284	0	a	Well the rubber push buttons .
15285	0	a	Do not you have to move your
15286	0	a	But anything is going to have buttons .
15287	0	a	Even if it is a jog wheel , it is still repetitive .
15288	0	a	I thought they would give an option of flat buttons or a
15289	0	a	That they do not .
15290	0	a	You
15291	0	a	You see , you can still get it does you still get repetitive strain injury , whether you are pressing a button or pressing a flat bit of screen .
15292	0	a	It is the v it is the fact that you are pressing the same doing the same movement .
15293	0	a	It is not actually what you are doing .
15294	0	a	But the fact that this this rubber i is actually used in these anti RSI ps specific Yeah .
15295	0	a	Yeah , the rubber is good .
15296	0	a	Yeah .
15297	0	a	We are giving them a way to burn off steam , basically , yeah .
15298	0	a	Yeah , so they can sit there and go like
15299	0	a	Not that watching TV should be that stressful .
15300	0	a	And you know , yeah , you can fuzz it across the room and throw it at throw it at your children
15301	0	a	yeah .
15302	0	a	Oh yeah , I guess TV can be stressful ,
15303	0	a	yeah ,
15304	0	a	if you are watching sports .
15305	0	a	Alright , that is me done .
15306	0	a	Alright .
15307	1	a	Okay , Gabriel .
15308	1	a	Let is let is let is hear from you about the it is the interface .
15309	1	a	Alright .
15310	0	a	Yeah , some of what I have to say ties into what Catherine was just talking about .
15311	0	a	Great .
15312	0	a	Sorry .
15313	1	a	Okay , so I am continuing with the user interface topic .
15314	0	a	And so basically I consulted with our manufacturing division .
15315	0	a	It sounded like Catherine was also speaking with them .
15316	0	a	I also took Reissa is marketing findings from the last meeting into consideration ,
15317	0	a	cause I think that is that is crucial as far as what keys we are going to inc inclu what buttons we are going to include and and how they are laid out .
15318	0	a	and so the manufacturing division sent some some samples of of interface components that we might be interested in using that have been used in other products , like the coffee machine .
15319	0	a	So I already mentioned the speech recognition interface .
15320	0	a	I guess , we we basically vetoed that idea .
15321	0	a	It is it is pointless .
15322	0	a	it is just a sample sensor sample output .
15323	0	a	It would just be probably the most expensive part of our remote without any actual interesting functionality as far as operating the TV .
15324	0	a	so yeah , they they also give the
15325	0	a	they they suggested the idea of using a spinning wheel like you use on the side of an MP three player like iPod .
15326	0	a	so we have already addressed that
15327	0	a	and I think that would actually be worse for something like RSI
15328	0	a	I mean you got that thumb movement that you are constantly doing .
15329	0	a	Yeah .
15330	0	a	That does get annoying .
15331	0	a	the other suggestion ,
15332	0	a	and I
15333	0	a	I have a feeling that we are interested in in something more general ,
15334	0	a	but they suggested , you know , going i a little bit into a a niche , like either gearing our remote towards kids , where you could have lot of colours , the keys might be you know , funny or or , or something for the elderly , where the remote is very large and the buttons are very large and there is only a few buttons .
15335	1	a	But you know we can we can discuss this ,
15336	0	a	but it sounded like from our last meeting we really wanted something that was general , but done well .
15337	0	a	So , the key layout and design are really crucial .
15338	0	a	Yeah .
15339	0	a	You do not want
15340	0	a	you want people to be able to quickly access the buttons that they use a lot without always pressing the wrong one .
15341	0	a	And I did not mention that we need a power button in our last
15342	1	a	I can give you an example here of , good layout and bad layout from our manufacturing department .
15343	0	a	So this would be an example of bad layout , where you have volume up and volume down , but they have a V on both of them , so it is sort of confusing for the user .
15344	0	a	Yeah .
15345	0	a	Yeah .
15346	0	a	this is the example of the giant remote that is impossible to lose .
15347	0	a	Do we have an example of a good one ?
15348	0	a	Brilliant .
15349	0	a	Uh huh .
15350	0	a	Well Maybe we can
15351	0	a	Right .
15352	0	a	And for something for kids .
15353	0	a	Yeah .
15354	0	a	Yeah .
15355	0	a	And so ,
15356	0	a	yeah ,
15357	0	a	I th
15358	0	a	I think my personal preferences of we have all kind of talked about and seemed to be on the same page .
15359	0	a	so I was against the speech recognition and against going towards anything in in a niche sense .
15360	0	a	I think it should be more general .
15361	0	a	I did not I did not think the spinning wheel or the LC display were were crucial for us .
15362	0	a	And , yeah , that is it for me .
15363	0	a	Okay .
15364	0	a	Well let is
15365	1	a	so w what are our definite decisions on this then as a team ?
15366	0	a	The
15367	1	a	The the the interface type we are going for
15368	0	a	Just the simple s simple straight set of buttons .
15369	1	a	So we are we are not going to have any sort of display I think .
15370	1	a	So , yeah , it is just going to be just going to be push buttons .
15371	1	a	I think we shall have a limited number of buttons , ideally , I mean a a power , channel up , channel down , volume up , volume down , and a numerical keypad .
15372	0	a	Yeah .
15373	0	a	Yeah .
15374	0	a	And some sort of
15375	1	a	it will either have a a lock button like we mentioned or or a cover or something like that .
15376	0	a	Yeah .
15377	1	a	I guess it is to the point where we need to decide about that .
15378	0	a	Okay ,
15379	0	a	and we are not
15380	0	a	yeah .
15381	0	a	Well now that we have decided on our
15382	0	a	it seems like we would not want to make it too busy and too sort of gaudy ,
15383	0	a	but
15384	1	a	Yeah , I would say mayb maybe a couple of colours like like a black with with yellow and somewhere , like maybe the RR can be yellow , or something like that .
15385	0	a	Are we going to hav hav
15386	0	a	an are we d
15387	0	a	have we decided on whether w we are going to s supplement it with anything ,
15388	0	a	you know , colours or particular gimmicky bits to it ,
15389	0	a	we are not we are just going to go for something
15390	0	a	We are
15391	0	a	Yeah .
15392	0	a	Yeah .
15393	0	a	Okay .
15394	0	a	Okey dokey .
15395	0	a	Yeah , I do not have any other questions on this .
15396	0	a	Let is move over to
15397	0	a	Yeah , sure .
15398	0	a	I I guess the fact also that we are having a rubber case would prevent us from having the cover function that we thought of before .
15399	0	a	I mean , cause s
15400	0	a	so if we want to have a lock of some sort it would have to be a button .
15401	0	a	But I think that should be
15402	1	a	I mean , I can speak with the button department ,
15403	0	a	but I think that it should be easy to have a button that just prevents prevents the other the other buttons from operating .
15404	0	a	Yeah , the button that just does that , yeah .
15405	0	a	So that should be simple .
15406	0	a	Cool .
15407	1	a	Well , I am just basically letting you know what is happening in the markets and what the fashions are for next year .
15408	0	a	yeah .
15409	0	a	So yes ,
15410	0	a	so from looking at this year is trends and fashions and also recent investigation that we have done in the remote control market , we have found that for the remote control market these are like most important aspects like that we really need to which we have already probably discussed .
15411	0	a	the most important aspect is look and feel .
15412	0	a	So the remote control has to look and feel fancier than the ones that already that we already have .
15413	0	a	So it has to be
15414	0	a	Yep .
15415	0	a	Yeah , why should people buy this when they are already got a remote that came with the TV ?
15416	0	a	What is that mean ?
15417	0	a	Okay ,
15418	0	a	now the trouble is is
15419	0	a	we have already decided that we are going with the stuff that works already , that is cheap .
15420	0	a	Exactly .
15421	0	a	Yeah .
15422	0	a	second , it should be technologically innovative innovative .
15423	0	a	So
15424	0	a	Technologically it should be like work , basically , I guess .
15425	0	a	It should work .
15426	0	a	Well it should be it should be maybe cutting edge in some sense , I mean have something that is little more technologically advanced than what is on the market .
15427	0	a	Should
15428	0	a	That is new .
15429	0	a	Yeah .
15430	0	a	Yeah .
15431	0	a	Yeah .
15432	0	a	Actually , I mean , these first two points we have already sort of gone away from , cause our rubber one is not fancy
15433	0	a	I mean it is different , but I would not say like a rubber remote is fancy .
15434	0	a	Yeah .
15435	0	a	Yeah .
15436	0	a	If that is what people want then we maybe we are going in the wrong direction .
15437	0	a	And it is it is not technologically innovative either .
15438	0	a	So , no loose
15439	0	a	That is why I was thinking , Bluetooth , cause if you like put up Bluetooth , and it is like a Bluetooth remote control , everybody is going to like , oh ,
15440	0	a	cause Bluetooth is the in thing nowadays , like it really is ,
15441	0	a	like people
15442	0	a	and when it comes to marketing like that is what people go for , they do not really care whether , you know , at the end of the day whether it works properly or not .
15443	0	a	Maybe we could
15444	0	a	Of course , they do .
15445	0	a	Well , they do , but it is like it is not
15446	0	a	Yeah ,
15447	0	a	but it looks good .
15448	0	a	One hundred per cent , that is your first thing , you go ,
15449	0	a	oh I am not going to buy that ,
15450	0	a	cause I dunno if it works or not .
15451	0	a	If it looks good and it is it can just be there for decoration .
15452	0	a	Okay , well ,
15453	0	a	what do you two think about this ?
15454	0	a	Yeah , what I do not understand what m
15455	0	a	Yeah ,
15456	0	a	and it this is just going to
15457	0	a	all this is being used for is your television .
15458	0	a	So is is the advantage of Bluetooth that you can just like synchronise it with other electronics ?
15459	0	a	Yeah , that is basically what it allows you to do ,
15460	0	a	right ?
15461	0	a	Yeah , the that would not be the remote so much ,
15462	0	a	I mean
15463	0	a	But like
15464	0	a	You could always insert , yeah .
15465	0	a	Yeah , but , I mean , people like
15466	0	a	Well , if you are looking at if you looking at something that is going to be bought by people , you have to make it new , you have to make it state of the art .
15467	0	a	It would
15468	0	a	that would mean you would need a television that has Bluetooth in it , which no no television does ,
15469	0	a	does it ?
15470	0	a	That would mean we would have to make a television as well .
15471	0	a	Well
15472	0	a	Bluetooth would , for example , enable you , I think , to connect for example you if you get a w call on your mobile phone , but your mobile phone is downstairs or something , you would get on your television
15473	0	a	you are being called by this person right now .
15474	0	a	Things like that .
15475	0	a	No , that would be your telephone in with your television .
15476	0	a	No i
15477	0	a	No , but if you get Bluetooth on the remote , you would be able to
15478	0	a	I with the television ,
15479	0	a	yeah .
15480	0	a	Yeah ,
15481	0	a	and i
15482	0	a	Nah , the televi the television would have to be a Bluetooth compatible , basically .
15483	0	a	I was just trying to find an advantage .
15484	0	a	Wha what w what advantage would you get for the
15485	1	a	Maybe the kinetic mo provision of energy then .
15486	0	a	Well , it does not
15487	0	a	Like it does not have to be , you know , Bluetooth ,
15488	0	a	that was just an idea ,
15489	0	a	but like it needs do something that , you know , is new .
15490	0	a	An and there is no there is no such thing
15491	0	a	Whether it is a battery it could be something really really minor , you know , like
15492	0	a	but I think we are really keeping to what is already out there , and people have already seen it , people have already got it .
15493	0	a	Okay .
15494	1	a	If we want something new , we need to move away from what we already have and just go creative .
15495	0	a	It is been done for watches , but I have not seen that for remotes , yet .
15496	0	a	Okay .
15497	0	a	Yeah , this that is that is very good .
15498	1	a	And then you can market it .
15499	0	a	Never have to change a battery again .
15500	0	a	Change the batteries ever again .
15501	0	a	And and this is all tying in very nicely .
15502	0	a	The fact that it is made out of this rubber , we can throw it about .
15503	1	a	Th we should encourage people to throw their remote controls about , because it charges itself up by doing it .
15504	0	a	Yeah ,
15505	1	a	well , and in little characters you say , yeah , but not too much .
15506	0	a	Yes , so can
15507	1	a	Yeah , we can make the squeezing of the rubber be the be the generating like the energy generator .
15508	0	a	I think , safety s
15509	0	a	Yeah .
15510	0	a	But yeah , by the squeezing it the
15511	0	a	Yeah , that is a great idea .
15512	0	a	Well done .
15513	0	a	Third most important aspect is it is easy to use .
15514	0	a	And I think we have all worked that out .
15515	0	a	we are all about that .
15516	0	a	okay , in the fashion , how it is supposed to look .
15517	0	a	Next year is fashion i very much in fruit and vegetables are thm are like the theme for cloths , shoes and furniture .
15518	0	a	So next year people will be buying ,
15519	0	a	I found this really funny ,
15520	0	a	you know , strawberry shaped chairs ,
15521	1	a	Okay , so we could have keys that are like a b like a broccoli key and a and an avocado key on them .
15522	0	a	Yeah .
15523	0	a	Yeah .
15524	0	a	Rubber things .
15525	0	a	I want to watch the pineapple channel .
15526	0	a	and as it is rubber the feel which is in this year is spongy ,
15527	0	a	so it is it is not quite spongy , but spongy , I would say is
15528	0	a	yeah
15529	0	a	, so we are in .
15530	0	a	Well spongy , that is where .
15531	0	a	Yeah , we are we are ahead of the game there .
15532	0	a	Yeah , that is great for us .
15533	0	a	Yeah .
15534	0	a	And so personal what I was just saying like move away from the current remote controls like the look and the feel of the current ones and change the look and feel , while still keeping to the company is image , basically .
15535	0	a	So yeah .
15536	0	a	Okay .
15537	0	a	I had to say
15538	0	a	So we are moving in the right direction like
15539	0	a	Right .
15540	0	a	Alright , yeah ,
15541	0	a	no ,
15542	0	a	this
15543	0	a	i this is good ,
15544	0	a	so through all that we have we go we are
15545	1	a	right , we are going to go go back to going with the kinetic thing ,
15546	0	a	that is great ,
15547	1	a	using the spongy rubber that we were talking about
15548	0	a	that anti RSI you can as you squeeze it you are not only therapeuticising yourself , you are charging the batteries ,
15549	0	a	and I am not sure about the buttons being in the shape of fruit though .
15550	0	a	Yeah .
15551	0	a	Yeah , that is great .
15552	0	a	Yep .
15553	0	a	Yeah , I do not know how we incorporate We do not have to follow every trend , I guess .
15554	0	a	No vegetables .
15555	1	a	Maybe make it like fruity colours or something .
15556	0	a	Some sort .
15557	0	a	Uh huh .
15558	0	a	Or
15559	1	a	The power button could be like a big apple or something .
15560	0	a	Well yeah ,
15561	0	a	but Apple would sue you for that .
15562	0	a	Yeah , this is true .
15563	0	a	They don they do not own all images of apples .
15564	0	a	sued the Beatles so
15565	0	a	Yeah .
15566	1	a	Okay , we will make it a pomegranate , a big pomegranate .
15567	0	a	Well , okay , it seems like the only thing that we have not really finally agreed on is its image .
15568	0	a	Like , yeah , we are we are saying no we do not want it to be fruit and vegetables , but we dunno what it should be ,
15569	1	a	or like are we going
15570	1	a	yeah
15571	1	a	it looks slick , but what do what do we mean by slick sort of thing ?
15572	0	a	I mean you said earlier on i
15573	0	a	it should be funky .
15574	0	a	Well
15575	0	a	I think , if it is rubber it needs to be different .
15576	0	a	I think , it is it should be
15577	0	a	I mean , what do you associate with rubber ?
15578	1	a	You know like really different colours basically .
15579	0	a	L keep it clean , keep it clean .
15580	0	a	Okay , sor
15581	0	a	I sorry ,
15582	0	a	I used the wrong word ,
15583	0	a	what do you associate with the mate the material that material ?
15584	1	a	like I am just thinking bright colours .
15585	0	a	Yeah .
15586	1	a	Bright natural colours , nothing too
15587	0	a	Bright , but too not
15588	0	a	yeah .
15589	0	a	Bright , but not too bright .
15590	0	a	Yeah .
15591	1	a	Like no lime green or bright yellow or bright pink .
15592	1	a	Wanna make it different colours so anybody can choo like like
15593	0	a	Yeah .
15594	0	a	Like the volume buttons should be the all the same colour and the d and the the channel buttons should be one colour and stuff like that , do you mean ?
15595	0	a	Okay ,
15596	0	a	what ?
15597	0	a	Okay .
15598	1	a	And on the back of it have the logo .
15599	0	a	Sure .
15600	0	a	Why not ?
15601	1	a	I am going to write that down .
15602	0	a	The one thing I am wondering about , I hope that we are not going like too much down a gimmicky road of of having
15603	0	a	I mean if somebody go goes into the store they are going to see like three or four normal remotes , and then a big spongy pink t tomato remote .
15604	0	a	Tha
15605	0	a	Yeah ,
15606	0	a	I mean we that is we we
15607	0	a	Yeah .
15608	0	a	This is the remote control tomato .
15609	0	a	I mean what are ninety per cent of people going to take ?
15610	0	a	Well I can say in this country , you will get , you know , lots of people wanting something really funky and cool .
15611	0	a	Like
15612	0	a	and kids will be walking in with their parents saying , Mummy I want to buy that one .
15613	0	a	And parents will see the will see the pro as well , because it is like kids wo not break it , it is not breakable if you throw it around .
15614	0	a	Yeah .
15615	0	a	Especially with younger kids , you know they can pick it up and and
15616	0	a	Yeah .
15617	0	a	The only thing is is that really small kids might chew on it , but
15618	0	a	Yeah .
15619	0	a	Well , it is it is gotta be chew proof .
15620	0	a	So so it is rea it is quite
15621	0	a	it is quite like user friendly and also for different families , like like family use as well , so for little kids and for old ki like teenagers will like it , I think .
15622	0	a	Especially maybe younger girls if it is in pink they will be like pink remote control for their room something .
15623	0	a	So , what are you saying , maybe we should market it in different colours for different
15624	1	a	so we could do like the pink range , the blue range , the green range , the
15625	0	a	Yeah .
15626	0	a	That is yeah .
15627	0	a	So like you walk in , you are like , oh I like that remote control , because it is so bright , and then , and then the shop assistant comes up and says , oh what colour would you like ?
15628	0	a	and then they go like ,
15629	0	a	oh I can choose the colour
15630	0	a	wow .
15631	0	a	So it puts , I think , even the customer into more control over what they are buying instead of
15632	0	a	, you have got all colour
15633	0	a	it is either that or nothing .
15634	0	a	So they also get to pick .
15635	0	a	Well , personally I like walking into a shop and choosing a colour .
15636	0	a	Yeah I mean , that that seems to work well with for products like iPod ,
15637	0	a	where , you know , you have a variety of colours , that people feel like they are customising it when they buy it , even , you know , just just by the fact of choosing .
15638	0	a	It is
15639	0	a	Yeah .
15640	0	a	D you have got the
15641	0	a	Evaluation .
15642	0	a	Although I would be curious to see how many
15643	0	a	You know , there are some colours that I wouldn I would never choose , and I would be curious how many people choose that colour .
15644	0	a	Right .
15645	0	a	Well that is that can be down to bit of market researching you know , if that is easy enough to find out what colours are more popular .
15646	0	a	Yeah .
15647	1	a	And produce less of the silly colours , maybe .
15648	0	a	Okay .
15649	0	a	Alright .
15650	0	a	Well , we will alright let is
15651	0	a	what we are going to aim to get together by the next meeting then
15652	0	a	is
15653	0	a	from you Catherine wi your y y
15654	0	a	you know you are going to be working on the the look and feel design .
15655	0	a	Yep .
15656	0	a	Gabriel , you are going to be working on , you know come up with the the user interface design .
15657	0	a	Then basically , you two are going to be working together on this .
15658	0	a	You wo not be going off to your separate offices .
15659	0	a	Alright .
15660	0	a	Okay .
15661	0	a	and I think you are going to get a chance to play with some clay .
15662	0	a	Oh right .
15663	0	a	I think , yeah , it is going to you know ,
15664	0	a	come up ki you know , be ab for the next meeting be able to come in and show us some some
15665	0	a	i some physical ideas .
15666	0	a	Cause at the moment , you know , it is it is hard .
15667	0	a	Cool .
15668	0	a	Yeah .
15669	0	a	We were kind of going ,
15670	0	a	yeah , it is gotta feel nice
15671	0	a	, it is gotta look cool and that it is you know
15672	0	a	now we can actually start , you know
15673	0	a	, s some sort of physical something or other .
15674	0	a	It is .
15675	0	a	That sounds good .
15676	0	a	and you are going to be working on the product evaluation .
15677	0	a	And I will be talking to the bosses , basically , and f fielding off some more spam and that is it really .
15678	0	a	Great .
15679	0	a	Keeping things t well ,
15680	0	a	you know , ho hopefully keeping things together .
15681	0	a	Yeah , that is
15682	0	a	This is this is good .
15683	0	a	So we know for definite
15684	0	a	we know we have we have now got some definite things going on .
15685	0	a	We definitely know how it is powered , we definitely know that it is going to be a simple buttons , we are not going to be going for the new technological chip on print expensive things ,
15686	0	a	so we have we are keeping the costs down .
15687	0	a	It is this rubber casing that we can sell as fun and funky .
15688	0	a	Do not know of any other remote controls that are made out of this stuff .
15689	0	a	People , you know , people are saying , oh , standard stuff gives you repetitive strain injury , well this remote control is designed to do the complete opposite , It is supposed to fix it rather than cause it .
15690	0	a	Yeah .
15691	0	a	you know , we are going to we
15692	0	a	we are going to as a sort of extra something on it , you know what what extra things are there extra things this product have ?
15693	1	a	We will look into this lock key facility ,
15694	0	a	although whether or not it happens , or is possible , I do not know ,
15695	1	a	but something to look into .
15696	0	a	Right .
15697	0	a	Okay .
15698	0	a	I think that is
15699	0	a	well done everybody .
15700	0	a	Alright .
15701	0	a	Anyone have any any questions ,
15702	0	a	everyone know what they are doing ?
15703	0	a	Cause if you do not , you will I am sure you will soon get an e mail about it .
15704	0	a	Yeah .
15705	0	a	Yeah .
15706	0	a	, I think we all know what we need to do now .
15707	0	a	S
15708	0	a	This gives you all the details ?
15709	0	a	Okay .
15710	0	a	Okay .
15711	0	a	right well .
15712	0	a	It is we are we have still couple of minutes until our meeting is due to finish .
15713	0	a	But
15714	0	a	I got a note saying that
15715	0	a	you two who are going to be working together
15716	1	a	so bef before you all disappear off just hold hold fire .
15717	0	a	Okay ,
15718	1	a	I will stay in here .
15719	0	a	Does the pay raise immediately come into effect on our next pay check , or is that So we are buying fut
15720	0	a	I mean , we are getting futures in the company .
15721	0	a	I think , it is , yeah ,
15722	0	a	I think , it is going to be par part more of a profit sharing on the product .
15723	0	a	Yeah , I think i I think that is
15724	0	a	I think that is the way it is going to happen at the moment .
15725	0	a	So we really have a incentive to make this remote work .
15726	0	a	Yeah .
15727	0	a	Yeah .
15728	0	a	I would like to share in the coffee machine profits , because that is really doing well .
15729	0	a	I want a share in the space rocket .
15730	0	a	Did you see that this k that this company we have made a spaceship .
15731	0	a	Yeah .
15732	0	a	Yeah .
15733	0	a	This company has its its fingers in a lot of different pots .
15734	0	a	Yeah .
15735	0	a	Yeah .
15736	0	a	Yeah , we are definitely not in the money making department .
15737	0	a	Well I I did notice looking at
15738	0	a	I mean , they told you that they wanted whatev our product to represent the the RR brand and and to be immediately noticeable .
15739	0	a	Yeah .
15740	0	a	I mean , if you look like at the coffee maker at the at the corporate web page , it is not obvious .
15741	0	a	RR .
15742	0	a	Well it is to us , because we we worked worked here for years and we use that coffee machine ,
15743	0	a	but it is does not have the colour scheme of of the of the company anywhere on it
15744	0	a	obviously it is just sil silver and black .
15745	0	a	That is true .
15746	0	a	And the spaceship does not have the R have a massive R and R down the side of it
15747	0	a	but I still want one .
15748	0	a	No .
15749	0	a	Does not
15750	0	a	Yeah .
15751	0	a	Okay .
15752	0	a	I have just had a sign flashing up saying , finish the meeting .
15753	0	a	Okay .
15754	0	a	Yeah .
15755	0	a	Right , well , I guess that is us .
15756	0	a	Yeah .
15757	0	a	It is not telling
15758	0	a	it is not saying do anything in particular just yet .
15759	1	a	So maybe you should go back to your own offices .
15760	0	a	Okay .
15761	0	a	Yeah .
15762	0	a	 
15763	0	a	It is Play Doh .
15764	0	a	Play Doh is edible .
15765	0	a	Did you know that ?
15766	0	a	It is definitely
15767	0	a	Yeah .
15768	0	a	Because kids
15769	0	a	yeah .
15770	0	a	I used to eat it .
15771	0	a	I have , I have definitely eaten it before .
15772	0	a	I did not know was edible .
15773	0	a	But , it is it is made edible cause ,
15774	0	a	yeah .
15775	0	a	It is it is chew proof .
15776	0	a	It is made edible cause kids eat it ,
15777	0	a	and if it is was not edible then
15778	0	a	Well , normal babies .
15779	0	a	Yeah .
15780	0	a	Actually that makes sense ,
15781	0	a	because I remember like , peopl
15782	0	a	I dunno
15783	0	a	if my Mom ever did it
15784	0	a	but I remember other people is Moms making like home made Play Doh where you just like make the colouring and make some sort of sort of dough .
15785	0	a	Yeah .
15786	0	a	Oh yeah it is , yeah .
15787	0	a	Oh yeah .
15788	0	a	Right .
15789	0	a	Everybody everybody ready ?
15790	1	a	Okay , let is have your let is get have the presentation ?
15791	0	a	Nice .
15792	0	a	Yeah .
15793	0	a	Yep .
15794	0	a	We have got some .
15795	0	a	We have got a cool prototype .
15796	0	a	Yeah , it is pretty exciting .
15797	0	a	So ,
15798	0	a	everything that we wanted we wanted it to be ergonomic and to be made out of rubber , very simple and easy to use ,
15799	0	a	yeah , double curved ,
15800	0	a	but also something that was going to jump out at people , something that would be different , separate it from the other remotes out on the market .
15801	0	a	Double curved .
15802	1	a	So I think if you put this in the palm of your hand , you will see what a nice thing we have going here .
15803	0	a	That is cool .
15804	0	a	So , basically , if you hold it like that , the one on your thumb , yeah , the thumb button is the power button .
15805	0	a	Your index finger is channel up , middle finger is channel down , ring finger is volume up , your pinkie is volume down .
15806	0	a	What is the big blue thing ?
15807	0	a	Oh cool .
15808	0	a	That is the lock button , has a L L on it
15809	0	a	and then the M is a mute button .
15810	0	a	And then it also has digit For muting the
15811	0	a	and then then you can also there is a numeric keypad on the top
15812	0	a	so you can key directly to the to the channel if you want .
15813	0	a	what button ? .
15814	0	a	And mute .
15815	0	a	Oh mute .
15816	0	a	Okay .
15817	0	a	So it is really basic functionalities as far as what keys are available ,
15818	0	a	but we think it is very comfortable and very innovative and it looks different .
15819	0	a	That certainly does .
15820	0	a	So all the , I mean the important keys are right at your f
15821	0	a	f you know right at at a convenient place for you to to access them .
15822	0	a	So you do not you
15823	0	a	Yeah .
15824	0	a	Which is ant anti RSI .
15825	0	a	It should be .
15826	0	a	And it is also conformable to the size of your hand .
15827	0	a	I mean if that is too big , it is a rubber remote , so you can , you know change that .
15828	0	a	Yeah .
15829	0	a	Is great .
15830	0	a	Oh it is so cute .
15831	0	a	So d does that what mesh with what you guys were hoping and for and expecting or does it
15832	0	a	, that is good thinking ,
15833	0	a	yeah .
15834	0	a	I have one thing about it , but it is a small thing , but it would mean we would have to make a right handed one and a left handed one .
15835	0	a	Oh right , yeah .
15836	0	a	But , that is I do not see why that is not possible .
15837	0	a	Yeah , if we build rocket ships why ca not we build left handed and right handed remotes .
15838	0	a	Yeah .
15839	0	a	They make left handed scissors , you know .
15840	0	a	Yeah ,
15841	0	a	but then
15842	0	a	but then you can learn to use your right h
15843	0	a	like I was just thinking if there is left handers and right handers in the family , what , they have two remotes ?
15844	0	a	Yeah , I am sure they will be able to
15845	0	a	I mean it is only pressing buttons , you do not have to do anything , you know , extraordinary .
15846	0	a	Yeah , I did not I did not think about that , but I would
15847	0	a	yeah , .
15848	0	a	Yes s .
15849	0	a	Yeah , I know I know people who have left handed and right handed people in the family and they all use the computer for the whole the same computer the fes family and they have a mouse , and everybody is using right handed mouse .
15850	0	a	Sure .
15851	0	a	Sure .
15852	0	a	Uh huh .
15853	0	a	I think everybody can press a button with their left and right hand so
15854	0	a	Yeah , it is not
15855	0	a	Yeah .
15856	0	a	Yeah .
15857	0	a	Imagine d are you right handed ?
15858	1	a	Imagine you are doing it with your left hand ,
15859	0	a	I do not think it is too
15860	1	a	But we can have both
15861	0	a	Yeah .
15862	0	a	Yeah .
15863	1	a	Have them in stock .
15864	0	a	Yeah .
15865	0	a	Make them more appealing as well .
15866	0	a	But other than that , I mean and that is , you know , that is just something , I think I think it is great , yeah , great idea .
15867	0	a	Do you think it says RR ?
15868	0	a	Fashion to electronics .
15869	0	a	I think it does .
15870	0	a	I think it is , well , if the RR motto is , we bring fashion to to electronics , I would say that could be quite fashionable .
15871	0	a	Yeah .
15872	0	a	Yeah .
15873	0	a	Yeah .
15874	0	a	And it is got the b the black and yellow and blue .
15875	0	a	Plus red , which is sort of a a fruit and vegetable .
15876	0	a	Yeah .
15877	0	a	There you go .
15878	0	a	Yeah .
15879	0	a	So that is that is our end of things
15880	0	a	wha
15881	0	a	That is
15882	0	a	Yeah .
15883	0	a	Yeah , very good , yeah .
15884	0	a	It is come up with what we have you know , the things that is what we have what we were looking at doing , has not it , all seems to be there .
15885	0	a	Well done .
15886	0	a	And all the playing around is
15887	0	a	Yeah , I am just
15888	0	a	do you want to plug in ?
15889	0	a	Okay .
15890	0	a	before we move on I need that cable .
15891	0	a	Thank you .
15892	0	a	Yeah .
15893	1	a	One thing I do need to do we need to look at , is the costs .
15894	0	a	The costs , was that what you said ?
15895	0	a	But it is edible .
15896	0	a	Play Doh is very cheap .
15897	0	a	Well , yeah .
15898	0	a	Play Doh wo not last very long everybody will go like , oops , it is gone .
15899	0	a	Yeah .
15900	0	a	Chew proof .
15901	0	a	Well , they will buy more of them if you eat them , .
15902	0	a	That was the main criteria from the last meeting , it had to be chew proof .
15903	0	a	right .
15904	0	a	Okay , now I think we will do this
15905	0	a	I could do you know , I can do this o on my own or I could do it with you ,
15906	0	a	but it is just easy enough to go through it with you ,
15907	0	a	so we are going for the kinetic power .
15908	0	a	Yeah .
15909	0	a	Oh ho ho .
15910	0	a	Yep .
15911	0	a	And the electronics , we decided on it being just a simple , the easiest thing that is inside it .
15912	0	a	Ooh .
15913	0	a	So the case , we have gone for the double curved .
15914	0	a	and it is made out of rubber .
15915	0	a	The interface is push buttons .
15916	0	a	And button supplements well they are in diff special colours ,
15917	0	a	are not they ?
15918	0	a	So special colours .
15919	0	a	Yeah .
15920	0	a	Yeah .
15921	0	a	It is better for
15922	0	a	And special material .
15923	0	a	Special form , yeah ,
15924	0	a	they are a special form there in shapes and stuff .
15925	0	a	Yeah ,
15926	0	a	I mean , these these ones on the side are curved kind of , so The buttons are rubber .
15927	0	a	Yep .
15928	0	a	Yeah .
15929	0	a	Are they made out of any special material ?
15930	0	a	No they are not .
15931	0	a	Rubber .
15932	0	a	They are not made out of wood or titanium or rubber or anything , they are just simple
15933	0	a	Okay .
15934	0	a	Well they are rubber , are not they ?
15935	0	a	We are under budget .
15936	0	a	Yeah .
15937	0	a	Right .
15938	1	a	So let is see if that comes within budget .
15939	0	a	And it does .
15940	0	a	That is going to cost
15941	0	a	Yeah .
15942	0	a	That is going to cost ten ten Euro seventy cents a unit to make .
15943	0	a	And our target was it had to come in at under twelve fifty .
15944	0	a	That is cool .
15945	0	a	Yeah .
15946	0	a	Yeah .
15947	0	a	So ,
15948	0	a	this is all very very good .
15949	0	a	And we are actua actually making a better profit than we expected .
15950	0	a	The bosses will be very pleased .
15951	1	a	Okay , let is just save this
15952	1	a	so I can e mail it to you .
15953	0	a	Save it in save it in the my documents .
15954	0	a	It is already saved , I think .
15955	0	a	Splendid .
15956	0	a	Okay .
15957	0	a	So , that is done with this with this doodah ,
15958	1	a	so you are .
15959	1	a	Gonna do what you were going to do ,
15960	0	a	your evaluation .
15961	0	a	Thank you .
15962	0	a	Oh , yeah .
15963	0	a	This is where we all get to
15964	1	a	I get to write on the , oops , on the board .
15965	0	a	Right .
15966	0	a	Oh .
15967	0	a	Is function
15968	0	a	Okay .
15969	0	a	F eight .
15970	0	a	I love the smell of that Play Doh .
15971	0	a	Yeah ,
15972	1	a	have some have some .
15973	0	a	I cou .
15974	0	a	Okay .
15975	0	a	So , evaluation .
15976	0	a	We are going to do it all together so we evaluate each criteria .
15977	0	a	I have got the criterias .
15978	0	a	And we have to do it on a scale of one to seven , one being true ,
15979	0	a	so it is it is more like it is fits the criteria , and
15980	0	a	seven being as in it does not fit the criteria .
15981	0	a	And the criterias are ,
15982	1	a	and I will draw this up on the board
15983	0	a	so we have a box
15984	0	a	And this is false , this is just like to keep you informed .
15985	0	a	So seven is here and one is here and then you have got in the middle .
15986	0	a	So the first criteria .
15987	0	a	Do you all get what we are doing ?
15988	0	a	Okay , cool .
15989	0	a	Okay , first criteria , look and feel .
15990	0	a	So the does remote look and feel fashionable to what we talked about ?
15991	0	a	As it is it colour wise and is it spongy ?
15992	0	a	So what mark should we give for that ?
15993	0	a	As in it is not .
15994	0	a	I would give it a seven .
15995	0	a	Yeah .
15996	0	a	Oh , sorry , one .
15997	0	a	Oh sorry , one , d
15998	0	a	yeah .
15999	0	a	A one .
16000	0	a	A one a one .
16001	1	a	So I will just write criteria criteria one we get one .
16002	0	a	Second criteria , new technology .
16003	0	a	Have we implemented new technology ?
16004	0	a	As in the new high tech
16005	0	a	So it is .
16006	0	a	Well , the kinetic thing , yeah .
16007	0	a	Yeah .
16008	0	a	Yeah .
16009	0	a	That was our main technological innovation w every everything else was fairly simple , but the fact that we used the kinetic energy was new .
16010	0	a	So we will give it a
16011	0	a	Yeah .
16012	0	a	Well so the
16013	0	a	Yeah .
16014	0	a	It is ergonomic , but that is not that is that is a design that is a des that is a design thing ,
16015	0	a	yeah .
16016	0	a	Yeah , but that is not a technological thing , that is another thing , i that is another marketing thing .
16017	0	a	Yeah .
16018	0	a	Yeah .
16019	0	a	True .
16020	0	a	So on the technical side of it it Easy to use .
16021	0	a	I would say it is about a a twoish ?
16022	0	a	Two .
16023	0	a	It is about in the mid in the middle somewhere , maybe , yeah , I dunno .
16024	0	a	Two .
16025	0	a	Three .
16026	0	a	Yeah .
16027	0	a	Maybe three , yeah .
16028	0	a	three .
16029	0	a	So criteria three is is it easy to use ?
16030	0	a	I think it is a one , I think .
16031	0	a	I would say it is I would not
16032	0	a	not if you are left handed it is not .
16033	0	a	Yeah .
16034	0	a	I would give it a
16035	0	a	I would give it a two , cause i i it
16036	0	a	i it
16037	0	a	i it is more geared for right handed people than left handed people , but
16038	0	a	Yeah .
16039	0	a	Two ,
16040	0	a	so it is
16041	0	a	But if we make a right handed and a left handed then ?
16042	0	a	Yeah .
16043	0	a	Okay .
16044	0	a	If we are going to have one left handed and one right handed then I would give it a one , but otherwise otherwise a two .
16045	0	a	Yeah .
16046	0	a	Give it a t give it a two .
16047	0	a	Yeah , okay .
16048	0	a	Kay , criteria four is costs .
16049	0	a	Cost .
16050	0	a	It is come in under budget .
16051	0	a	is great .
16052	0	a	Yeah .
16053	0	a	So that is a definite one .
16054	0	a	That was great .
16055	0	a	Yeah .
16056	0	a	Amount of buttons .
16057	0	a	Like the amount of buttons ,
16058	0	a	cause people like a lot le like
16059	0	a	So it is a one ?
16060	0	a	criteria six .
16061	0	a	Contains only the necessary buttons .
16062	0	a	Yeah .
16063	0	a	Yeah .
16064	0	a	Yeah .
16065	0	a	RSI is it good against ?
16066	0	a	Yes .
16067	0	a	Yes s yeah .
16068	0	a	So it is anti RSI .
16069	0	a	Very good .
16070	0	a	It is one .
16071	0	a	And criteria seven , which is the last one ,
16072	0	a	does it get lost ?
16073	0	a	Is it easy to get lost ?
16074	0	a	No ?
16075	0	a	But it is smallish .
16076	0	a	It is yellow .
16077	0	a	I do not think it is going to get lost easily .
16078	0	a	It is very bright , yeah .
16079	0	a	It is not the kind of thing that is going to slip like between a couch cushion or something , you know .
16080	0	a	Two .
16081	0	a	Maybe it will .
16082	0	a	T
16083	0	a	I think i it would , could be , could get lost .
16084	0	a	You think it could lost
16085	0	a	two .
16086	0	a	Yeah .
16087	0	a	I mean it is not fully
16088	0	a	it is not fully like you ca not say
16089	0	a	I mean , it is not a one , definitely .
16090	0	a	I mean it
16091	0	a	No ,
16092	0	a	I mean
16093	0	a	I mean , you could still flush it down the toilet theoretically , but
16094	0	a	Okay .
16095	0	a	Okay .
16096	0	a	Yeah , anything , I mean .
16097	0	a	Okay .
16098	0	a	It is bigger than the average mobile , I guess .
16099	0	a	Yeah .
16100	0	a	But , yeah , it can get lost .
16101	0	a	The mobiles get lost all the time .
16102	0	a	Yeah .
16103	0	a	Okay , yeah , two is fine .
16104	0	a	But then you ring them and you find them .
16105	0	a	Yeah ,
16106	0	a	yeah .
16107	0	a	So Yeah .
16108	0	a	So , that is that .
16109	0	a	So that is the evaluation ,
16110	0	a	so I would say Yay .
16111	0	a	Alright it is all all systems go .
16112	0	a	It is like like a number one .
16113	0	a	We have , we have done well .
16114	0	a	Yeah .
16115	0	a	Number one product .
16116	0	a	All done , thanks .
16117	0	a	We ca not fail .
16118	0	a	We fitted all the criterias .
16119	0	a	Yeah .
16120	0	a	Yeah , so
16121	0	a	So that is that one .
16122	0	a	Well done , Reissa .
16123	0	a	Okay , I
16124	0	a	I think I just want to put in as Project Manager the you know , little bit of praise for everybody here for how they have worked on it , you know , both individually and as a team .
16125	0	a	You know you have w everyone is come up with their own individual ideas in their own different departments ,
16126	0	a	and then come together and worked in , you know , integrally , you know , at the right times , psp , you know , especially you two .
16127	0	a	That is all , you know , gone very very well
16128	0	a	and and
16129	0	a	and be you know , has been good communication going on .
16130	0	a	Yeah .
16131	0	a	Yeah ,
16132	0	a	during our design I mean there was some s some heated heated discussion ,
16133	0	a	but we we kept we tried to keep it cool and
16134	0	a	and
16135	0	a	just just
16136	0	a	We just had to we just had to squeeze our product a little bit and
16137	0	a	Now you guys have been a a great team .
16138	0	a	Did you have to go down to the the corporate squash court and bash a few balls about ?
16139	0	a	Fantastic .
16140	0	a	Well .
16141	0	a	You know
16142	0	a	It is .
16143	0	a	Think we are the we are the envy of all the of all the other RR teams , .
16144	0	a	been cool .
16145	0	a	I think So
16146	0	a	I
16147	0	a	I , you know ,
16148	0	a	and I think we have
16149	0	a	co we have come we have come up with something new , something that has not been done before
16150	0	a	, we have not we are not just rehashing an old design .
16151	0	a	In four diff
16152	0	a	in in four meetings .
16153	0	a	Yeah .
16154	0	a	Funny , all designer meetings could be this quick .
16155	0	a	You know , maybe this is not a simulation , maybe this is actually
16156	0	a	so it is like Sony or someone like that they are
16157	0	a	they are just ,
16158	0	a	yeah , they get
16159	0	a	Yeah .
16160	0	a	Yeah I think they are actually trying to find ideas for a ideal remote .
16161	0	a	They are using our ideas .
16162	0	a	Yeah , two years' time this will be on the market .
16163	0	a	Ex exactly that product
16164	0	a	thum
16165	0	a	we will go , yeah , we designed that and no one will believe us .
16166	0	a	But
16167	0	a	No , I think when this meeting is finished like officially , there b we will get a questionnaire to fill in .
16168	0	a	So at this stage , I mean , is this the last meeting of the project ?
16169	0	a	We do not have another one after it is gone gone to marke market or something ?
16170	0	a	So there is no way to like predict what our
16171	0	a	Cause we had a
16172	0	a	we originally had a As far as our financial goals , we had a specific number for profits that we wanted .
16173	0	a	Yeah .
16174	0	a	Y
16175	0	a	Oh really ?
16176	0	a	yep .
16177	0	a	Or six ,
16178	0	a	I have not got message .
16179	1	a	Just start summarising now .
16180	1	a	You can reply to the same message .
16181	0	a	See summary , there .
16182	0	a	If you just reply to that one .
16183	0	a	It was fifty mil fifty million I do not remember .
16184	0	a	Was it was it fifty or five ?
16185	0	a	Depends how much we sell .
16186	0	a	But there is not a way to compute that ,
16187	0	a	I mean , since we saved on the on the production cost , do we know how much we are making on profit ?
16188	0	a	It gets handed over to another department .
16189	0	a	What our what our project was was to come up with the product , basically .
16190	0	a	the for the
16191	0	a	and just basically is it it come can is it within budget .
16192	0	a	When it c when it comes to all the other things of how to sell it and , you know , the b the profits and all that
16193	0	a	that is other departments
16194	0	a	it is another team that actually work out the mai the
16195	0	a	oh yeah , the all the guys in the profit sharing , yeah .
16196	0	a	But we have a vested interest
16197	0	a	prof profit sharing .
16198	0	a	Yeah , that is it .
16199	0	a	You know , we have we have we have made i we have made
16200	0	a	we have designed the product , we have ma
16201	0	a	we have got the prototype , it is within budget , it is does everything that we wanted it to do .
16202	0	a	We finished an hour earlier .
16203	0	a	It is new , it is it is something that that is not out there already .
16204	0	a	I think actually and one advantage of of this is that after the , you know , after this fad of fruit and vegetables passes this will still be c a cool remote , you know .
16205	0	a	We are not we are not you know , tying tying our cart to that one horse .
16206	0	a	Yeah .
16207	0	a	Well , this is very marketable in that it is
16208	0	a	it is it is something that is kind of new and looks a bit quirky for people who want that ,
16209	0	a	it is that it is ,
16210	0	a	hang on ,
16211	0	a	I wrote it down here somewhere
16212	0	a	Oh no
16213	0	a	I thi
16214	0	a	I put it in one of my e mails that I sent off .
16215	0	a	Definitely .
16216	0	a	that , you know , it is marketable in the sense that it is whilst all these other remotes actually do give you repetitive strain injury , our one does the complete opposite , you know ,
16217	0	a	so that is something that is new ,
16218	0	a	which is one of the criteria they asked us to come up with something with something new .
16219	0	a	It make watching TV healthy .
16220	0	a	Yeah , and if you are not having a good time with the TV , you can f throw it about , you know .
16221	0	a	Yeah .
16222	0	a	It is fine , it is kid proof .
16223	0	a	Just do not sh do not throw it at any of the ornaments and break them .
16224	0	a	Well , you can break the ornaments , but you wo not break that .
16225	0	a	No .
16226	0	a	Yeah .
16227	0	a	So all in all , I think we have done very well .
16228	0	a	Well done everybody .
16229	0	a	Yay .
16230	0	a	Right , you too .
16231	0	a	Drinks are on the company .
16232	0	a	Cool .
16233	0	a	In the corporate bar that is next to the corporate swimming pool on the top floor that we are that have all just gained access to .
16234	0	a	Glad to hear that .
16235	0	a	Yeah .
16236	0	a	That is it .
16237	0	a	That is it .
16238	0	a	Well , as far as I t as far as I know .
16239	0	a	Yep .
16240	0	a	We have not got the five minute left thing yet .
16241	0	a	No .
16242	0	a	Anyone want to play I spy ?
16243	0	a	Yeah , I guess .
16244	1	a	I guess it is probably better that we wrap it up than have five minutes of silence .
16245	0	a	Should we call the day then ?
16246	0	a	, right .
16247	0	a	I mean we are going to get asked to fill out another questionnaire .
16248	0	a	It is probably going to be the same as one we have done before .
16249	0	a	In project .
16250	0	a	But I am not the authority to say that it is .
16251	0	a	how does everyone feel about the technology that is been used in this ?
16252	0	a	The sort of using of the the pens and writing on these special pads and all that ?
16253	0	a	Yeah .
16254	0	a	I love it .
16255	0	a	I love it .
16256	0	a	I think it is cool .
16257	0	a	Being all wired up and a vibrating pen and it is cool .
16258	0	a	Being watched .
16259	0	a	Wow .
16260	0	a	Your moment to shine .
16261	0	a	I thi you know , I would I would
16262	0	a	n
16263	0	a	yeah ,
16264	0	a	as we said earlier , I have not never seen that before .
16265	0	a	something that t the whiteboard thingy ,
16266	0	a	that is great .
16267	0	a	Yeah .
16268	0	a	, but a p a pen with a camera on it , I do not think it is such a new thing .
16269	0	a	I mean it is i or in such a new idea .
16270	0	a	It would be different if it was sort of hand writing recognition stuff , but as it is not
16271	0	a	it is literally that will come up on a computer screen as a picture file rather than actual text .
16272	0	a	Right ,
16273	0	a	I think they do want to do hand writing recognition on that , it is just the first step .
16274	0	a	Yeah .
16275	0	a	Yeah .
16276	0	a	Logitech .
16277	1	a	I guess we should end this , since we are off off topic .
16278	0	a	Yeah .
16279	1	a	So .
16280	1	a	Shall we
16281	0	a	 
16282	0	a	Okay .
16283	0	a	Good morning everybody .
16284	0	a	I am glad you could all come .
16285	0	a	I am really excited to start this team .
16286	1	a	I am just going to have a little PowerPoint presentation for us , for our kick off meeting .
16287	0	a	My name is Rose Lindgren .
16288	0	a	I I will be the Project Manager .
16289	0	a	our agenda today is we are going to do a little opening
16290	0	a	and then I am going to talk a little bit about the project , then we will move into acquaintance such as getting to know each other a little bit , including a tool training exercise .
16291	0	a	And then we will move into the project plan , do a little discussion and close , since we only have twenty five minutes .
16292	0	a	First of all our project aim .
16293	0	a	we are creating a new remote control which we have three goals about , it needs to be original , trendy and user friendly .
16294	0	a	I am hoping that we can all work together to achieve all three of those .
16295	0	a	so we are going to divide us up into three compa three parts .
16296	0	a	First the functional design which will be first we will do individual work , come into a meeting , the conceptional design , individual work and a meeting , and then the detailed design , individual work and a meeting .
16297	0	a	So that we will each be doing our own ideas and then coming together and collaborating .
16298	0	a	Okay ,
16299	1	a	we are going to get to know each other a little bit .
16300	0	a	So ,
16301	1	a	what we are going to do is start off with let is start off with Amina .
16302	0	a	Alima ,
16303	0	a	sorry
16304	0	a	, Alima .
16305	0	a	Alima .
16306	0	a	we are going to do a little tool training , so we are going to work with that whiteboard behind you .
16307	1	a	introduce yourself , say one thing about yourself and then draw your favourite animal and tell us about it .
16308	0	a	Okay .
16309	0	a	I do not know which one of these I have to bring with me .
16310	0	a	Probably both .
16311	0	a	Right , so ,
16312	0	a	I am supposed to draw my favourite animal .
16313	0	a	I have no drawing skills whatsoever .
16314	1	a	But let is see , introduce myself .
16315	0	a	My name is Alima Bucciantini .
16316	0	a	I am from the state of Maine in the US .
16317	0	a	I am doing nationalism studies ,
16318	0	a	and I have no artistic talents .
16319	0	a	How do you spell your name ?
16320	0	a	Thanks .
16321	0	a	A L I M A .
16322	0	a	Oh ,
16323	0	a	and I guess I am the Industrial Designer on this project .
16324	0	a	So
16325	0	a	let is see if I can get
16326	1	a	here .
16327	1	a	I will draw a little turtle for you all .
16328	0	a	Not necessarily cause it is my absolute favourite animal , but just that I think they are drawable .
16329	0	a	And you have the pretty little shell going on .
16330	0	a	Some little eyes .
16331	0	a	Happy .
16332	1	a	There you go .
16333	0	a	That is a turtle .
16334	0	a	Yes .
16335	0	a	So what are your favourite characteristics ?
16336	0	a	I I like the whole having a shell thing .
16337	0	a	It is quite cool carry your home around where you go ,
16338	0	a	quite decorative little animals , they can swim ,
16339	0	a	they can ,
16340	0	a	they are very adaptable , they carry everything they need with them , and they are easy to draw .
16341	0	a	Excellent .
16342	0	a	Shall we just go around the table ?
16343	0	a	Okay .
16344	0	a	Well ,
16345	0	a	my name is Iain and I am the User Interface Designer for the project .
16346	1	a	And I will try and draw my favourite animal .
16347	0	a	I will
16348	1	a	I should leave that one on there
16349	0	a	should not I
16350	0	a	before I callously rub it off .
16351	0	a	No ,
16352	1	a	you can erase the turtle ,
16353	0	a	it is alright .
16354	1	a	Might be nice to have them all up there at same time .
16355	1	a	I am not going to draw it quite to scale .
16356	0	a	Is that at least identifiable ?
16357	0	a	It is a whale , yes .
16358	0	a	Snake .
16359	0	a	Well .
16360	0	a	Em kay .
16361	0	a	Well ,
16362	0	a	snake ?
16363	0	a	It is w
16364	0	a	Oh ,
16365	0	a	a cat .
16366	0	a	Thanks .
16367	0	a	Oh my god , it is better than what I am going to be able to do .
16368	0	a	and , yeah ,
16369	0	a	the reason I like whales is cause they are well , first of all they are quite intelligent and also they are they are kind of mysterious ,
16370	0	a	like we do not really know much about them or or understand how they work , how they form groups .
16371	0	a	And I just find them interesting animals .
16372	0	a	Take my contraptions with me .
16373	0	a	Alright ,
16374	0	a	I am Jessy .
16375	0	a	I am from around DC ish sort of in the US .
16376	0	a	And we are going to keep the deep sea sort of theme going on , animal .
16377	0	a	Do not really know how to draw this .
16378	0	a	Just where can I
16379	1	a	Maybe if I do the water ,
16380	1	a	but how ?
16381	0	a	Sort of give an idea .
16382	0	a	I have no idea how one would explain this .
16383	1	a	maybe with some whiskers .
16384	0	a	Briefly , it is supposed to be a seal .
16385	0	a	You can imagine it in the water .
16386	0	a	I like them , because they are like playful and silly sort of have a good time .
16387	1	a	Not going to try and pretend like I can get any better than that .
16388	1	a	kay ?
16389	0	a	I am Rose and I am Project Manager , from California .
16390	0	a	S
16391	0	a	it is actually a coyote .
16392	0	a	It is definitely significantly harder once you are doing it .
16393	0	a	Yeah .
16394	0	a	Let is see .
16395	0	a	Right .
16396	0	a	Let is see ,
16397	1	a	let is give it a little bit of a snout , I do not know , some teeth .
16398	0	a	That is impressive .
16399	0	a	That is
16400	0	a	That is pretty impressive .
16401	0	a	Yeah .
16402	0	a	Cool .
16403	0	a	Oh dear .
16404	0	a	Yes .
16405	0	a	I live I live right across the street from an open space in California .
16406	0	a	We have coyotes howl all the time .
16407	0	a	So I really enjoy their their singing , you they are really beautiful animals .
16408	0	a	Okay ,
16409	1	a	moving on to slightly more serious stuff .
16410	1	a	We are going to talk about project finances .
16411	0	a	we have a couple
16412	0	a	we would like to sell it for about twenty five Euro with the profit aim of fifteen million Euro from our sales and because this is such this is for television it is a we have a market range of Internet , like it is an international market range , we do not have to worry about specifics .
16413	0	a	in order to make a profit of this magnitude , we need to be able to produce each one at a maximum of twelve fifty Euro .
16414	0	a	So we are selling it for twice what we would like to produce it for .
16415	0	a	Okay ,
16416	1	a	just to generate a little bit of discussion about the project , I could I would like to hear about your experiences using ro remote controls , your first ideas about creating a new r remote control ,
16417	0	a	what would be the best like you what are the features that you really like what are the features that you do not like , etcetera ,
16418	0	a	so
16419	0	a	I hate when there is like four different buttons and you have to press to actually turn on the TV
16420	0	a	like you have to do one for the power of the TV and then like another one to get the actual screen on and something else to get it all going , I do not know .
16421	0	a	Now they keep combining all different remotes together ,
16422	0	a	and I do not know if I necessarily like that
16423	0	a	cause I feel like you end up with multimedia overload .
16424	0	a	I just want to watch the TV .
16425	0	a	Always gets lost .
16426	1	a	Some sort of like device to help you find it .
16427	0	a	I have used , I have used remote controls , for things like TV and the CD player and video recorder
16428	0	a	and I
16429	0	a	I guess they are
16430	0	a	they are pretty neat
16431	0	a	neat little tools .
16432	0	a	You do not have to get up and walk across the room to change a channel .
16433	0	a	So especially if you are someone really lazy like me
16434	0	a	they they are pretty nice .
16435	0	a	I find them
16436	0	a	they can be a bit annoying ,
16437	0	a	especially , like you know if I am watching TV
16438	0	a	I have have to have three separate remote controls of in front of me , you know , one for the TV , one for the digital box , one for m the video recorder as well .
16439	0	a	And also they tend to they tend to be a bit confusing , they have got too many buttons on them too too sort of too sort of complicated
16440	0	a	when all I really want to do is switch on and off , change the channel , change the volume .
16441	0	a	Yeah .
16442	0	a	I agree with having too many remotes around .
16443	0	a	My dad has a whole drawer at home of remotes for various things , and I do not know how to work half of them .
16444	0	a	What is important for me , I guess , is that it is easy to use and that there is not too many buttons , they are not too small ,
16445	0	a	you know you know you need to n to know what you are doing .
16446	0	a	And one thing I particularly like is if you are not sort of moving it around to get it to work with the infra red .
16447	0	a	Yeah .
16448	0	a	Yeah .
16449	0	a	, I think there is a way around that , but I know in my residence right now the the television you sort of have to walk all around the room to get it to turn on , so i it is just simpler just to just turn around the TV itself ,
16450	1	a	and I think that is if we are going to make a remote control , it should actually work for what it is doing .
16451	0	a	So
16452	0	a	I know .
16453	0	a	What about like batteries and things like that , like are there some remotes that don do not require like batteries or do all remotes require batteries ?
16454	0	a	I would imagine all of them ,
16455	0	a	but we could
16456	1	a	but it is possible we could use like a lithium battery
16457	0	a	that would last a lot longer than like double As .
16458	0	a	Yeah ,
16459	0	a	something that does not
16460	0	a	like tho those are the batteries that are used in a lot of MP three players now and that kind of thing .
16461	0	a	Okay ,
16462	0	a	it seems we have a little bit of a conflict over to combining all the remotes cont together versus having f five different remotes .
16463	0	a	So
16464	0	a	like you said you do not like having all the buttons on one on one remote , and yet you do not want to have five remotes .
16465	1	a	So how do we work with that ?
16466	0	a	Yeah .
16467	1	a	Could we get something that just has
16468	0	a	No
16469	1	a	does not have all the buttons that you need to program the video recorder or program s other things that I am not very coherent about , but that just has your major buttons for that work for everything , you know volume control , on , off , channel changing .
16470	1	a	And maybe that spatially divides it , so it is like if you are looki if you are trying to get the TV on that is , you know , like the top thing on the remote , I dunno if d be vertical or horizontal in terms of how we are going to make it , but
16471	1	a	if it is like all the TV stuff was here , then all the VCR stuff was here , all the whatever else we have programmed into it
16472	1	a	it is all just in its separate place and not like all the on buttons together ,
16473	0	a	cause then you like , I do not even know what I am turning on .
16474	0	a	Yeah .
16475	0	a	N that way
16476	0	a	Yeah .
16477	0	a	Yeah ,
16478	1	a	and if if you would save the more complicated functions maybe for separate remotes that you would not need to use every day .
16479	0	a	Okay ,
16480	1	a	so maybe have like one remote that has the main functions on , off , channel changing , volume , and another rote remote with all the special things .
16481	0	a	Because that is one thing that remotes tend to have buttons that the TVs no longer have as well .
16482	0	a	Yeah .
16483	0	a	So like you have to have them somewhere , cause you are going to m need those special functions occasionally .
16484	0	a	Yeah .
16485	0	a	Right .
16486	1	a	but not necessarily on the m the normal remote .
16487	1	a	Can I ask ,
16488	0	a	are we designing a remote control for a television only , and if if this device is just to be used for the television would we even technically be possible to include video recorder functions on it ?
16489	0	a	or should we just stick to just stick to having television television related buttons on it ?
16490	1	a	So we should maybe we should assume that i t it is just a television that we are wanting to control .
16491	0	a	Good question .
16492	0	a	I do not know that yet .
16493	0	a	It is a good question .
16494	1	a	I will look into that .
16495	1	a	If I can .
16496	0	a	I think it is just TV ,
16497	0	a	I mean , if it if we are taking it just new product a new television remote control that is not like does not say .
16498	0	a	yeah .
16499	0	a	You know , things might be more advanced than that .
16500	0	a	Well ,
16501	0	a	I mean I suppose it would be nice to have playing and record and stop buttons on it for the video recorder as well
16502	0	a	I I do not know if that works technologically or not .
16503	0	a	Yes .
16504	1	a	I guess we have to define what what we are aiming for .
16505	0	a	If it is just a television then that it is a bit simpler , cause there is less buttons that would even need to be on it .
16506	0	a	Yeah .
16507	0	a	It is an idea with the buttons being really .
16508	0	a	Large .
16509	0	a	Yeah .
16510	1	a	If you have older people or people like me that are not very co ordinated hand eye , it is really quite important that you are not pressing a small like teeny mobiles phone size buttons , if we can help it .
16511	0	a	Yeah .
16512	0	a	Okay .
16513	0	a	Kay
16514	0	a	sounds like we have had a good little discussion for our first ideas .
16515	1	a	Mind if we move on ?
16516	0	a	Ps
16517	0	a	okay .
16518	0	a	Kay .
16519	0	a	now our next meeting starts in thirty minutes .
16520	0	a	I believe we have actually been only working on this this one for about twenty ,
16521	1	a	so we can continue discussing more new ideas if you would like ,
16522	0	a	but this is just a breakdown of what we will be doing individually .
16523	0	a	the industrial design , Alima will be doing the working design .
16524	0	a	Yeah .
16525	0	a	the User Interface Designer , that is for .
16526	0	a	Technical functions , I guess like keeping in mind the buttons thing , the size of the buttons .
16527	0	a	user requirements , so you will be hearing about different trends , about different things that people need , I guess kind of the same discussion that we have been having , we will get from the actual consum s consumers .
16528	0	a	kay .
16529	0	a	And you will get specific instructions sent by your personal coach .
16530	0	a	I realised in this past one we we did not have much , we just wanted to get a little brain storming done .
16531	0	a	so very exited to see all your animals
16532	0	a	and how what wonderful artists we all are .
16533	0	a	Any questions ?
16534	0	a	I have not gotten an agenda yet ,
16535	1	a	I will put that together .
16536	0	a	What we are going to be discussing at the next meeting ?
16537	0	a	Do we know that ?
16538	0	a	Right .
16539	0	a	I am sure as we will each get our own instruction and then because what we going to do is first our individual actions
16540	0	a	and then we will come back together .
16541	0	a	Yep .
16542	0	a	So I am sure we will all have more concrete things to contribute next time
16543	0	a	kay
16544	1	a	I will type up mi minutes and probably email those out to all of you .
16545	0	a	Kay .
16546	0	a	Yep .
16547	0	a	I am sure we will be busy .
16548	0	a	Okay .
16549	1	a	just including all the things that we talked about .
16550	1	a	Can you e mail your slides as well ?
16551	0	a	Is that possible ?
16552	0	a	Cool
16553	0	a	Yes , I yes , I think I can .
16554	1	a	I will just attach it to an email .
16555	0	a	And you are
16556	0	a	you are number two , three , four ?
16557	0	a	Is that correct ?
16558	0	a	Okay .
16559	0	a	I am two .
16560	0	a	Alright .
16561	0	a	Excellent .
16562	0	a	It was lovely meeting you all .
16563	1	a	Just make sure you keep checking the company web site and the emails .
16564	0	a	 
16565	0	a	Good to see you all again .
16566	0	a	Let is see if that comes up .
16567	0	a	This is our functional design meeting .
16568	1	a	Just a sec while my PowerPoint comes up .
16569	0	a	Et voila .
16570	0	a	Okay .
16571	0	a	we put the fashion in electronics .
16572	1	a	Let is start .
16573	0	a	Okay ,
16574	0	a	our agenda today
16575	0	a	just check the time , it is twelve thirteen .
16576	0	a	I am going to do an opening ,
16577	0	a	talk about
16578	0	a	did you all get the minutes ?
16579	0	a	I e mailed them to you .
16580	1	a	I am also putting them them in the shared folder .
16581	0	a	Yep .
16582	0	a	So then I we will talk about our general objectives and have your three presentations .
16583	0	a	Right .
16584	0	a	I will talk about the new project requirements I have just received , and then we have to make a decision on our remote control functions .
16585	0	a	Finally we will just close .
16586	0	a	We are starting this meeting at approximately twelve thirteen and we have forty minutes .
16587	0	a	So
16588	0	a	First of all the functional design objectives .
16589	0	a	we need to keep in mind the user requirement specification , what needs and desires are to be fulfilled , the functions design , what effects the apparatus should have , and the working design , how the apparatus actually works to fulfil its function .
16590	0	a	Okay ,
16591	0	a	three presentations ,
16592	1	a	you can go in any order you choose .
16593	0	a	shall we go in the order that you just did it ?
16594	0	a	I dunno .
16595	0	a	Sure , please do .
16596	0	a	How do I hook my screen up ?
16597	0	a	Where does it go ?
16598	1	a	I think , you might have to disconnect Rose .
16599	0	a	Yes I do .
16600	0	a	Yeah .
16601	0	a	Well
16602	0	a	there is a wee a wee plug just just that one there that is it ,
16603	0	a	yep .
16604	0	a	, I am not supposed to move this ,
16605	0	a	but
16606	0	a	Where is function ?
16607	0	a	No signal .
16608	1	a	And then you have to press function F eight
16609	0	a	I think it is on your laptop .
16610	0	a	Function , F eight , yeah .
16611	0	a	The blue one , FN .
16612	0	a	Is it plugged in all the way
16613	0	a	and you screwed it in
16614	0	a	and
16615	0	a	kay .
16616	0	a	, wait ,
16617	0	a	is screw in .
16618	0	a	Yeah .
16619	1	a	I
16620	1	a	I think you just have to push it in really hard .
16621	0	a	Push the screw .
16622	0	a	That is it .
16623	0	a	Oh , got it .
16624	0	a	alright
16625	0	a	I have never attached to anything .
16626	0	a	It is taking it a little bit
16627	0	a	Kay there you go .
16628	0	a	neither have I .
16629	0	a	Alright , so ,
16630	0	a	I do not know if you guys are able to get access to the report that was online or if I am the only one who is .
16631	0	a	Alright .
16632	0	a	But ,
16633	0	a	I do not even know how to play this .
16634	0	a	No .
16635	1	a	Press the little presentation .
16636	0	a	It is the
16637	0	a	it looks like a Y kind of over there above Draw .
16638	0	a	There , that one ,
16639	0	a	there you go .
16640	0	a	Alright .
16641	0	a	So
16642	1	a	we are just going to talk a little bit about the functional requirements that people specified when they were asked .
16643	0	a	I guess Real Reaction did some market research .
16644	0	a	They had a hundred subjects and their usability lab and they watched them watch TV and recorded the frequency that they used particular buttons and the relevance that those buttons had .
16645	0	a	What they found was they analysed people is desires and needs .
16646	0	a	Focusing on their desires , people specifically said that they thought remotes were ugly , seventy five per cent of the a hundred subjects noted that
16647	0	a	and that they
16648	0	a	more importantly though , eighty per cent said that they would be willing to pay more for a fancier looking remote .
16649	0	a	I do not know anything beyond what fancy means , but that is particularly of use to us , I think .
16650	0	a	also they did some questions on voice recognition and found that the desire for voice recognition was inversely related to age , so younger people were more inclined to want something with voice recognition , whereas the older people in the like sixty and above segment or so did not really think that they would pay more money for voice recognitions .
16651	0	a	people also had certain frustrations ,
16652	1	a	that I think that we could try to take into consideration with our design .
16653	0	a	Kay .
16654	0	a	That being people k frustrated with losing their remotes .
16655	0	a	I think , over fifty percent of the people mentioned that that was their biggest frustration .
16656	0	a	People are also frustrated with the difficulty it is to learn how to use a remote
16657	0	a	and I think that ties back to what you were saying before
16658	0	a	just that there is too many buttons ,
16659	1	a	it just needs to be easy to use .
16660	0	a	It also mentioned something called RSI
16661	0	a	and I was hoping someone might be able to inform me as to what RSI is ,
16662	0	a	because I do not know .
16663	0	a	Repetitive strain injury .
16664	0	a	What ? .
16665	0	a	Repetitive strain injury .
16666	0	a	There we go .
16667	0	a	Wow .
16668	0	a	So if you
16669	0	a	Cheers .
16670	0	a	People do not like that .
16671	0	a	So I guess sort of the carpal tunnel type thing , people do not like that , the repetitive use , I guess , caused a strain .
16672	0	a	looking at the needs people specified , the problem right now is that people is remotes are not matching their operating behaviour .
16673	0	a	People are only using ten per cent of the buttons that they have offered to them on their remote .
16674	0	a	And what people do most often is changing the channel and changing the volume .
16675	0	a	People also zap like to change the channel , about sixty five per cent during an hour of use .
16676	1	a	So we really just need to focus in on those volumes and channel changers rather than things like the audio settings , the screen settings and the channel settings ,
16677	0	a	because they are used much more infrequently and probably just complicate what is going on .
16678	1	a	So I think that some things that we might want to think about ,
16679	0	a	the idea of an LCD screen was brought up although they did not have any details on what people is preferences on that were , so
16680	0	a	I
16681	0	a	dunno know if that is coming to me later , or something like that .
16682	1	a	But something for us to consider also just the phenomenon that less is more when it comes to the buttons on the remote
16683	1	a	or what we want to make easiest to use ,
16684	1	a	make sure that , you know , something like an audio setting is not given as much importance and visibility on the remote as something like channel changing that is used a lot more often .
16685	1	a	And basically in order for us to win over to the consumer we just need to focus on what it looks like , that it has a fancy appeal and that it is not ugly and that it feels like the way they are going to use it ,
16686	0	a	so it does not give them any hand injuries or things like that .
16687	0	a	Thank you very much .
16688	0	a	That was that was great .
16689	0	a	kay .
16690	1	a	is move on to the next presentation on effects .
16691	0	a	Was that you ?
16692	0	a	Great .
16693	0	a	Yeah ,
16694	0	a	have I unscrewed it ?
16695	0	a	Here we go .
16696	1	a	Push .
16697	0	a	User interface ,
16698	0	a	right .
16699	0	a	Interface .
16700	0	a	And I think that is in the shared , if I did it right , if anyone wants to look at it .
16701	0	a	kay ,
16702	0	a	thank you .
16703	0	a	Okay ,
16704	0	a	great .
16705	0	a	Okay .
16706	0	a	Here we go .
16707	0	a	Right so
16708	0	a	I am going to talk about the technical technical functions design of the remote control .
16709	1	a	We need to start by considering what a remote control actually is .
16710	0	a	It is a device that allows us to produce certain effects on our television , so i it is basically a communication device .
16711	0	a	We we tell the remote control what we want to do , it sends a message to the television saying change the channel , change the volume ,
16712	0	a	yeah ,
16713	0	a	adjust these settings , adjust the brightness .
16714	0	a	how do we actually go about designing a new television remote control ?
16715	1	a	First thing to do is to come up with the design specifications .
16716	0	a	We need to know what our final product is going to be like , so we need a a clear idea of exactly what this product does , how it works , and what the end user is going to want from this product .
16717	0	a	Oh ,
16718	1	a	a way I would suggest that we could go about this is by designing several different prototypes of user interfaces for this product , and then trying to get some feedback about h how well these particular prototypes work , sorta find out what people think of them .
16719	0	a	using a remote control is is quite a subjective experience .
16720	0	a	, and different different people sort of prefer different things .
16721	0	a	we should remember that remote controls are a a fairly standard piece of equipment .
16722	0	a	When a users using a remote control , he or she expects the buttons to be in certain places .
16723	1	a	So in some sense we are going to we are going to have to aim for a device which is fairly conventional in design
16724	0	a	so that we are not completely shocking people .
16725	0	a	But I think within that there is also room for us to introduce novel ideas and to make something that is that is perhaps a little bit different , something that stands out .
16726	1	a	also in in designing the user interface we need to consider practicalities .
16727	0	a	the first of these is is technological
16728	1	a	what can we do with the current state of technology as it is .
16729	0	a	The second is is economic ,
16730	1	a	we need to find a balance between features and price .
16731	0	a	So
16732	0	a	as you mentioned things like voice recognition would would add to the price but it would also im improve the design of the product .
16733	0	a	So
16734	0	a	I had a look on the on the web to see if I could find a few examples of existing television remote controls .
16735	0	a	In analysing these we can consider what what things what is good about them , what things do they get right , what is bad about them , what is wrong with them ,
16736	1	a	how we can improve on the designs that that that I found and what can we do to make our product stand out from from the large majority of remote controls .
16737	0	a	Here is two examples probably at the extreme ends of the spectrum .
16738	0	a	on the left here we have got an engineering based design for a remote control , so it is one that is got lots of buttons
16739	0	a	, it is it is fully featured , everything you might possibly want to do is there , you know , it is got forward , backwards , up , down , channel numbers , volume , freeze frame .
16740	0	a	Yeah ,
16741	0	a	it is it is fully featured and it might take a while to get to learn to use it , but once you have learned it you can you can do whatever you want with your TV .
16742	0	a	The one on the right is a lot more basic .
16743	0	a	It is just got the essential functions of the TV changing the channel , play , stop , volume .
16744	0	a	It would be a lot quicker to learn to use it , but again th it is it is swings and roundabouts .
16745	0	a	There are disadvantages ,
16746	0	a	you ca not use it say to to freeze the television picture .
16747	0	a	there is a lot of features that are missing from that remote control .
16748	1	a	So we have got to to find our find a way of striking a balance between the two .
16749	0	a	as I said before , remote controls are subjective , different people want want different things .
16750	0	a	personally wa what I want from a remote control is a device that is simple , it it is easy to use , it is got big buttons for doing the things I do most often , changing the volume , changing the channel .
16751	0	a	It it does everything that I need it to ,
16752	0	a	as I said before , I am quite lazy ,
16753	0	a	I do not want to walk across the room just to adjust my television .
16754	1	a	I also want something that that looks cool , and that that feels good , that is ergonomically designed .
16755	0	a	kay .
16756	0	a	Thank you very much .
16757	0	a	That was very useful .
16758	0	a	It is funny to see the drastic difference between those two remotes .
16759	0	a	And neither of them were very pretty , you know ?
16760	0	a	No .
16761	0	a	Yeah .
16762	1	a	I think that could be our selling point .
16763	1	a	A fashion fashion remote .
16764	0	a	I think there is there is certainly a market for technology that looks cool .
16765	0	a	Right .
16766	0	a	And I think that is that is why companies like Apple have have have made a lot of progress .
16767	0	a	Yeah .
16768	0	a	Right ,
16769	0	a	I really ca not see what I am doing ,
16770	0	a	so does anyone have a
16771	0	a	Ah ha ,
16772	0	a	look at that , showing up already .
16773	0	a	You
16774	0	a	there it is .
16775	0	a	Lovely .
16776	1	a	So wait ,
16777	0	a	did it let you go on the Internet or was that just what it let you see ?
16778	0	a	Okay .
16779	0	a	that was just on the d on the company web site , yeah .
16780	0	a	Cause I was like googling
16781	0	a	and then I am like
16782	0	a	wait
16783	0	a	it wo not let me google .
16784	0	a	Yeah .
16785	0	a	Alright
16786	0	a	No ,
16787	0	a	how do I play again ?
16788	0	a	the
16789	0	a	it is right above Draw .
16790	0	a	There are three thingy if
16791	0	a	it is way at the bottom .
16792	0	a	Under three icons and it is the one that looks like a desk .
16793	0	a	Yeah , that one .
16794	0	a	There are Ys .
16795	0	a	Okay .
16796	0	a	So
16797	0	a	this is our working design presentation .
16798	0	a	I had a bit of some issues with this ,
16799	0	a	because I was not able to find everything I needed , but I guess that is we are still in early stages .
16800	0	a	so , yeah ,
16801	0	a	this is this .
16802	0	a	Though th the thing about working design is the
16803	0	a	what we are trying to do as a working design is figure out how the aparata apparatus can fulfil its function .
16804	0	a	one of the examples that kept coming up for me is that a coffee grinder .
16805	0	a	It works because it converts electrical energy to grinding the beans and then you put the bean through a filter and that filters out , and then you get coffee at the end that is nice and hot because of the combination of electrical energy
16806	0	a	and then the other things that are brought in to make it work .
16807	0	a	Do not know if I am explaining that very well ,
16808	1	a	but how do I get to the next s
16809	0	a	So
16810	0	a	h the method as
16811	0	a	working designers figure out what you need to make it fulfil this practical function , what what needs to be done and how do we convert all the elements to make that done .
16812	0	a	So
16813	0	a	wha
16814	0	a	the easiest thing to do is to break down all the points at which you need something to happen .
16815	0	a	So you make a schematic of the way that the the energy is converted tsh towards this practical function .
16816	1	a	And then I think the easiest thing to do is going to be work on each task separately .
16817	0	a	So
16818	0	a	You just press
16819	0	a	yeah ,
16820	1	a	just click .
16821	0	a	That will be fine .
16822	0	a	So
16823	0	a	the findings that I got very just very briefly is that you have a choice of the way that the information is projected to the receiver
16824	0	a	and in my opinion infra red is the best way to do that
16825	0	a	cause you do not need a sight line .
16826	1	a	So that is one thing we are going to work on .
16827	0	a	the user interface is critical here , because a lot of the things that happen in a remote control happen through the chip that controls that converts the electrical energy into data , which then goes through the infra red , so the the chip that I think Ian is designing , is going to be crucial .
16828	0	a	And really it all comes down to the to the user , because they are the one that is controlling most of the working design .
16829	0	a	So
16830	0	a	the components that we find here are the energy source , you know the battery or whatever that is going to m make it work , then the chip , which converts the data , the user that is controlling the chip , and the infra red bulb that is going to let us move the data to the receiver .
16831	0	a	So you have four main components and they are designed sort of like this .
16832	0	a	You have your energy source right there which then brings energy or information to the chip , which is also controlled by the users .
16833	0	a	You have energy going to the user who is controlling the chip
16834	0	a	ooh is not what I wanted to do .
16835	0	a	yeah
16836	1	a	use that thing you can go back , previous .
16837	0	a	Previous .
16838	0	a	Sorry about that , guys .
16839	0	a	Pardon .
16840	0	a	Oh .
16841	0	a	Oh , well .
16842	0	a	No , no , no , no
16843	0	a	, no .
16844	0	a	Okay .
16845	0	a	Okay ,
16846	1	a	let is just get back to my schematic here .
16847	1	a	Double click on it .
16848	1	a	With the right with the left hand one .
16849	0	a	W
16850	0	a	yeah ,
16851	0	a	yeah .
16852	0	a	I think it is frozen .
16853	0	a	Here .
16854	0	a	Do not show me that tip again .
16855	0	a	There we are .
16856	0	a	There we are .
16857	0	a	Sorry about this , guys .
16858	0	a	I am kind of pathetic with things like this .
16859	0	a	alright .
16860	0	a	So you have your energy source , your user interface who is controlling the chip , the chip also uses the energy , and the chip through the use of the user interface is going to control the switch which will work your infra red bulb , which will then bring the data to the receiver .
16861	0	a	So
16862	0	a	hopefully that makes sense for everyone in my kind of garbled way .
16863	0	a	This is the the parts of the working design that need to be figured out .
16864	1	a	And personal preferences , besides the fact that I ca not spell , we need a long lasting energy source ,
16865	0	a	people do not want to be changing it a lot .
16866	1	a	We need a chip that works well with the user interface , that is not too complicated .
16867	1	a	We need a straightforward interface , like Ian was saying , simple , not overwhelming it with information and we need a reliable and clear infra red signal ,
16868	0	a	so that you are not waving your remote around and having to get frustrated and go do it by hands .
16869	0	a	So that is pretty much it for the working design .
16870	0	a	Excellent .
16871	0	a	So , .
16872	1	a	Rose , do you think you can give me a hand with this ?
16873	0	a	Yeah .
16874	0	a	Yes , absolutely .
16875	0	a	I can never tell which way to turn these things .
16876	0	a	Lefty loosey , righty tighty ,
16877	0	a	right ?
16878	0	a	Lefty loosey , righty tighty .
16879	0	a	Yeah .
16880	0	a	What is up ?
16881	0	a	Lefty loosey .
16882	0	a	Never heard that before ,
16883	0	a	that is good .
16884	0	a	Oh yes .
16885	0	a	I will think of that every time now .
16886	0	a	It is going to stick in your head .
16887	0	a	Yeah , that is a good one
16888	0	a	it will stick with you .
16889	0	a	kay .
16890	0	a	I have nothing on my screen .
16891	1	a	Just a sec .
16892	0	a	Here we are .
16893	0	a	Ooh ,
16894	0	a	no signal .
16895	0	a	Okay , yeah , it is fine .
16896	0	a	Okay ,
16897	0	a	requirements .
16898	0	a	We have a couple new requirements that I was just e mailed right before the meeting
16899	1	a	and that we have to keep in in in mind as we are creating this .
16900	0	a	Okay .
16901	0	a	We did not bring it up yet , or at all in the meetings so far , but we are not going to work with teletext because well it that is been taken over by the internet , so we are not going to worry about we are not going to worry about that .
16902	0	a	What is teletext ?
16903	0	a	Oh .
16904	0	a	, it is a British thing .
16905	0	a	You do not have it in the States ?
16906	0	a	Oh ,
16907	0	a	I did not realise .
16908	0	a	Oh ,
16909	0	a	so
16910	0	a	No .
16911	0	a	It
16912	0	a	no .
16913	0	a	W d could
16914	1	a	would you care to explain it ?
16915	0	a	How ?
16916	0	a	Okay .
16917	0	a	yeah ,
16918	0	a	it is like a
16919	0	a	I suppose it is kind of similar to a very very basic web browser .
16920	0	a	you have like you have numbers on your remote control , y and you type in the page number you want , so like you type a hundred on your remote control and this this kind of index appears on the television screen with just some some text and some very blocky looking graphics on it .
16921	0	a	And you just type numbers to go to different pages and it gives you information , mostly rather boring stuff like what is on TV next and share prices and that kind of thing .
16922	0	a	S
16923	0	a	Lottery numbers and sport scores .
16924	0	a	Yep ,
16925	0	a	news headlines .
16926	0	a	But if you ever see the TV saying like go to page one sixty on Ceefax now , that is what they are talking about .
16927	0	a	Oh .
16928	0	a	It is earl it is pretty old technology .
16929	0	a	It is like nineteen eighties .
16930	0	a	That explains a lot .
16931	0	a	I have no idea why we do not have it ,
16932	0	a	but
16933	0	a	Kay .
16934	0	a	That is good .
16935	0	a	Interesting .
16936	0	a	Okay , well ,
16937	0	a	we are not going to the management has decided we are not going to work with that .
16938	0	a	Okay
16939	0	a	and we are also going to w
16940	0	a	like your question earlier whether this is going to be t for television , video , or etcetera .
16941	0	a	Just for television .
16942	0	a	That is what we are focused on .
16943	0	a	Right .
16944	0	a	otherwise becomes to complex , we want to get this out very quickly .
16945	0	a	We only have a a short amount of time .
16946	0	a	and finally there is more marketing ,
16947	0	a	I think , , our corporate image has to be recognisable .
16948	0	a	So
16949	1	a	while we are going to make it look pretty
16950	1	a	we need to use our colour and our slogan i in the new design .
16951	0	a	So what is our corporate image like ?
16952	0	a	It is It is kind of yellow colour with we put fashion in electronics .
16953	0	a	Looks like , yeah , kind of a yellow and black and we have that the emphasis on the Rs in
16954	0	a	It is like double R .
16955	0	a	Yeah .
16956	0	a	But it is , yeah ,
16957	0	a	we put the fashion in electronics .
16958	1	a	So we gotta keep that in that in mind .
16959	0	a	Okay ,
16960	0	a	so we want something that looks good and is yellow .
16961	0	a	Yep .
16962	0	a	Yep .
16963	0	a	Yeah ,
16964	1	a	or ha maybe some buttons could be yellow .
16965	0	a	Okay .
16966	1	a	Like , we can we can play around with it a little bit .
16967	0	a	Okay ,
16968	1	a	we need to talk about our functions and our target group .
16969	1	a	We need to decide who our target group is .
16970	0	a	You in your analysis of different market of the marketing , you identified that different groups wanted different things or had certain preferences , for example that that older people did not really care for voice recognition , but younger people did .
16971	0	a	and so
16972	1	a	who are we aiming this at ?
16973	0	a	Well
16974	0	a	if we are going to say that function fashion we put the fashion in in electronics then you automatically ,
16975	0	a	I think , a sort of younger group that that is who is going to be attracted to this .
16976	0	a	Yes ,
16977	0	a	I do think , who is going to have the money to buy that also , that one ?
16978	0	a	The only break down that I was given in terms of age was the voice activation and basically there is a big jump , after thirty five people do not really care if it has voice , so it is like basically fifteen to thirty five that think that that is a good idea .
16979	0	a	It is going to be twenty five Euro remember , so it has to be avai marketable to whomever it is .
16980	0	a	Is it is it something that is going to be sold separately from the television or is it something that comes w with a television ?
16981	0	a	Cause that would affect the way that we market it .
16982	0	a	Well
16983	0	a	at least right now what we are doing is deciding on just the remote itself , so it will probably be sold separately , twenty five Euro by itself .
16984	0	a	Right .
16985	0	a	Right , okay .
16986	0	a	I dunno
16987	0	a	I am going to be given any other numbers broken down in terms of age later ,
16988	1	a	but if that is sort of the only quality that we have that is divided into age then we would want to stick between the fifteen and thirty five range .
16989	0	a	Yeah ,
16990	0	a	that is probably a population w quite a little bit of disposable income for use on technology anyway ,
16991	1	a	so that might be a fairly good target group for us .
16992	0	a	Yeah .
16993	0	a	Now ,
16994	0	a	those are
16995	0	a	that is all specific for speech recognition .
16996	0	a	Are we going to use that as one of our functions ?
16997	0	a	I I would say no ,
16998	0	a	because it is going to add too much to the price .
16999	0	a	Especially if we are marketing it as a separate product , people are going to be paying
17000	0	a	, well ,
17001	0	a	we have got a price limit of was it twelve twelve and a half Euros for to produce it ?
17002	0	a	And I wonder if we can get voice recognition into that twelve and a half Euros without having to make too many other compromises .
17003	0	a	To produce it , yeah .
17004	0	a	To produce it , yes .
17005	1	a	But what else are we going to put ,
17006	0	a	I mean not that I am really gung ho about it ,
17007	1	a	I do not know what else you can put in a remote to make it technologically advanced though .
17008	0	a	So like other than just making it look good , how is it
17009	0	a	I mean it can look really great and still have the same up n down buttons
17010	0	a	and why is anyone going to buy a new remote ?
17011	0	a	Yeah .
17012	0	a	But
17013	0	a	right .
17014	0	a	Well
17015	0	a	but why are we why are we aiming for a technological advancement ?
17016	0	a	Everything we are talking about is ease of use and simple and that does not necessarily mean more technology , in fact it could use it could mean , not .
17017	0	a	That is a good thing to keep in mind .
17018	0	a	If
17019	0	a	they might be overwhelmed with with remotes that have too many buttons and too much technology .
17020	0	a	If someone is looking to buy a new remote , do not they want like an upgrade ?
17021	0	a	I dunno .
17022	0	a	Upgrade ?
17023	0	a	Well ,
17024	0	a	we can look for
17025	1	a	we can look at upgrade or we can look at user friendly .
17026	0	a	Yeah , simplification .
17027	0	a	Yeah .
17028	0	a	Simplification ,
17029	0	a	so
17030	0	a	Uh huh , .
17031	0	a	They could have a crap remote that came with their TV that is just impossible to use , or maybe it broke , or maybe they are just missing it .
17032	0	a	And we also need to talk about if we are only going to have the very simple ones or also have the other ones just separate somehow
17033	0	a	or
17034	0	a	Kind of pull out of the side .
17035	0	a	Can you like
17036	0	a	I mean this may be too complicated ,
17037	0	a	but , I wish I had something to explain it ,
17038	1	a	like if it was just a simple , either this way or this way , that had like the main buttons and then you could like pull something out , kind of and like you got the rest the buttons , but the rest of them like went in .
17039	0	a	Yeah .
17040	0	a	Ooh .
17041	0	a	The remote
17042	0	a	There are remote controls like that ,
17043	0	a	yeah .
17044	0	a	Do you know what I am saying ?
17045	0	a	Like some TVs they have a sort of a sliding screen on the remote control of it that hides all the complicated buttons .
17046	0	a	Ooh .
17047	0	a	So if you want to do something complicated like programme your television or re tune it , then you you open up this little hatch or or slide the screen down and there is all the all the special buttons .
17048	0	a	Cause then is like people who do not want to ever look at them , never even have to see them and if you like get the instruction manual that comes with it and you just do not even read it then
17049	0	a	you will never even know that those things can pull out .
17050	0	a	Yeah .
17051	0	a	And you are a happy person and everyone else does not have to have like two remotes , one that has the easy ones and one that has more complicated ones , but is all still in one .
17052	0	a	Yeah , that is a good idea .
17053	0	a	Yeah .
17054	0	a	I think that is a good idea , yeah .
17055	1	a	we have to be careful that that that does not impede the chip transmitting information ,
17056	0	a	but that is going to be mostly technological thing .
17057	0	a	Yeah .
17058	0	a	Good point .
17059	0	a	Yeah .
17060	0	a	Yeah .
17061	0	a	Okay , so
17062	1	a	what are we emphasising ?
17063	1	a	I
17064	1	a	what in this project ?
17065	0	a	Simplicity and fashion .
17066	1	a	Si simplicity and fashion .
17067	1	a	I think simplicity , fashion .
17068	0	a	Yeah .
17069	0	a	Okay ,
17070	0	a	those are very good goals , I think ,
17071	1	a	that we have to keep in mind in with everything we do .
17072	1	a	Simplicity and fashion and , yeah , or usability
17073	0	a	speci
17074	1	a	however you want to say that ,
17075	0	a	which includes an emphasis on making the infra red very functional , so that you do not have to travel around a lot .
17076	0	a	Yeah .
17077	0	a	Yeah .
17078	1	a	What can you do to like make the infra red more functional ,
17079	0	a	like why would it not be ?
17080	0	a	I am just wondering .
17081	0	a	I think it is a lot to do with battery ,
17082	0	a	but that is just my
17083	0	a	Okay .
17084	0	a	The battery and that I think that the chip takes the data and presents it well , without sort of scattering .
17085	0	a	So is just the quality of the chip .
17086	0	a	Yeah .
17087	0	a	I think so .
17088	0	a	Okay .
17089	0	a	The quality quality of all the components really ,
17090	1	a	I mean , we ca not really do anything shoddy work ,
17091	0	a	cause it is going to be visible down the line .
17092	0	a	Yeah .
17093	0	a	So our target group , we are saying , fifteen to thirty five ?
17094	0	a	S voice recognition , which I kind of I kind of feel like voice recognition is not necessary in a remote control , like it might be necessary for a TV but not for the remote c , you know .
17095	0	a	Well ,
17096	0	a	I dunno how useful that number is if we are not doing
17097	0	a	Yeah .
17098	0	a	Yeah .
17099	0	a	I do not .
17100	0	a	It is , yeah , it is pretty it is pretty high tech .
17101	0	a	Mm mm .
17102	0	a	Seems a little bit
17103	0	a	Yeah .
17104	0	a	Yeah , and it might be too expensive .
17105	0	a	And if the whole idea is you are using a remote then why would you have voice ,
17106	0	a	like you know what I mean
17107	0	a	and then it is like you would not need a remote you would just talk to your TV .
17108	0	a	Yeah .
17109	0	a	It is for , like , the ultimately lazy people , who ca not even be bothered to pick up the remote .
17110	0	a	Ooh .
17111	0	a	Yeah .
17112	0	a	yeah .
17113	0	a	Maybe
17114	1	a	I mean if I get m more numbers , I will e mail you before the next meeting in terms of ages .
17115	0	a	I
17116	0	a	But this does not divide up anything and there was only a hundred subjects also ,
17117	0	a	which is not , I mean , really is not that representative ,
17118	0	a	especially if it is a hundred subjects that th they then can subdivide into age groups that means there is very few in each age group ,
17119	0	a	so
17120	0	a	Twenty to like fifty five .
17121	0	a	Yeah ,
17122	1	a	but I th I think regardless we are we are aiming for the under sixty five or something .
17123	0	a	Under sixty five , okay ,
17124	0	a	that is a good start .
17125	0	a	Yep .
17126	0	a	I would say we are
17127	0	a	can we narrow it down to maybe teenagers and families ?
17128	0	a	Cause that would go up to like fifty ?
17129	0	a	Okay , single It is it is hard to narrow it down .
17130	0	a	Or like single professionals or something .
17131	0	a	Yeah .
17132	0	a	I dunno .
17133	0	a	It is really hard to figure out right now .
17134	0	a	I think the product appeals across a quite a broad range of ages .
17135	0	a	I mean , we we said simplicity is is one of the features , so it is going to appeal to people , maybe people who have problems with technology , you know , people who get scared by having lots of buttons , and that might be older people ,
17136	0	a	but then we have also got fashion , which is something that definitely appeals to younger people .
17137	0	a	Okay .
17138	0	a	Yeah .
17139	0	a	Well
17140	1	a	maybe we do not have to defi define the target group by the demographic of age , maybe we can define it by like the demographic of like h t how much money they have to spend or something like that ,
17141	0	a	like , well
17142	1	a	obviously it has to be someone who owns a television , and like how recently have they bought their television like that sort of thing .
17143	0	a	Right .
17144	0	a	Yeah .
17145	0	a	Yeah aim for a an income group .
17146	0	a	That is a good point .
17147	0	a	Yeah .
17148	1	a	So maybe it is more useful to d d to define objectives like fashion and simplicity than to find specific target group as far as age is
17149	0	a	because , yeah , things so different will appeal to different people ,
17150	0	a	but
17151	0	a	Okay .
17152	0	a	Yeah , t probably .
17153	0	a	Yeah .
17154	0	a	oh ,
17155	0	a	there are a couple functions do we want something
17156	0	a	so that
17157	0	a	do we want some kind of thing to find it if it is lost ?
17158	0	a	Like a button on a TV you can press and it will ring or something ,
17159	0	a	I do not know
17160	0	a	like
17161	0	a	or beep ?
17162	0	a	Yeah .
17163	0	a	H
17164	0	a	I mean ,
17165	0	a	like I said before , fifty per cent of of the fru
17166	0	a	f like frustration someone can have that was the biggest one and half the people said that happened and we all mentioned it before we knew about it .
17167	0	a	Yeah .
17168	0	a	And if we are talking about making something easy that sort of goes along with it so it would not be like a random thing to sort of add in .
17169	0	a	It would be relevant to like the overall goal I think ,
17170	0	a	so
17171	0	a	Yeah , that will probably be good .
17172	0	a	Okay ,
17173	0	a	we have to
17174	0	a	we have about four minutes left to define our functions .
17175	1	a	So let is do that quickly .
17176	0	a	so we want something to keep it from getting lost .
17177	0	a	Yep .
17178	0	a	Yeah .
17179	0	a	And we want we want large buttons for the essential things .
17180	0	a	Yeah .
17181	0	a	Yeah .
17182	0	a	Large , accessible buttons for the essentials .
17183	0	a	We want a possibility to to get a possibility to get the extra functions .
17184	0	a	Yeah .
17185	0	a	Which are kind of hidden away in some way or well not hidden but they are they are not as prominent as the main features .
17186	0	a	, yeah , hidden way .
17187	0	a	And we also want it to be fashionable , which I am not sure if that is a function so much as a yeah
17188	0	a	on your coffee table , it is not like an eye sore , that kind of thing .
17189	0	a	Yeah .
17190	0	a	Alright .
17191	0	a	Okay ,
17192	1	a	do it .
17193	1	a	Any other essential functions that we need ?
17194	0	a	Battery ?
17195	0	a	Do we need a long life battery ?
17196	1	a	But we might as well .
17197	1	a	Battery battery use .
17198	0	a	Yeah ,
17199	0	a	but I think that goes in with simplicity and ease of use really .
17200	0	a	Yeah .
17201	0	a	So you never have to change the battery .
17202	0	a	Yeah .
17203	1	a	We should maybe investigate whether it needs a battery at all .
17204	0	a	I suspect the remote control does need a battery ,
17205	0	a	but I dunno if you can
17206	0	a	Yeah .
17207	0	a	Yeah , I would imagine .
17208	0	a	Yeah .
17209	0	a	Just cause it is an electronic device ,
17210	0	a	the
17211	0	a	Charging .
17212	0	a	It
17213	0	a	I think it does .
17214	0	a	I do not I do not think of a way you can operate a chip and convert that much data without without one .
17215	0	a	Yeah , without the energy , yeah .
17216	1	a	But you could maybe have it in a little charging station like a mobile phone , or like a little cradle for your iPod .
17217	0	a	Yeah , that is that is possible .
17218	0	a	You could
17219	1	a	we could maybe do that instead .
17220	0	a	Yeah .
17221	0	a	So you do not ha you got like a rechargeable battery .
17222	0	a	Yeah .
17223	0	a	I dunno ,
17224	0	a	that might contribute to less people losing it too if it it stays in one place .
17225	1	a	We have to think about space in living rooms , too ,
17226	0	a	like cause they are
17227	0	a	I mean , would you put it on top of the TV ?
17228	0	a	I do not know ,
17229	1	a	just think
17230	0	a	okay ,
17231	0	a	that is that is a good idea ,
17232	1	a	we will keep it .
17233	0	a	Yeah .
17234	0	a	Think it is
17235	0	a	And maybe fun .
17236	0	a	That is just off the top of my head .
17237	0	a	Okay .
17238	0	a	kay
17239	1	a	we are going to conclude now ,
17240	0	a	has everyone said their functions
17241	0	a	and
17242	0	a	kay .
17243	0	a	after the meeting we are going to each complete a sks a questionnaire and a summaries summary .
17244	0	a	I do not know what summarisation .
17245	0	a	and then we will have our lunch break .
17246	0	a	After that we have thirty minutes of individual work .
17247	1	a	I will make sure to put up the minutes and the project documentation and including these PowerPoint slides .
17248	1	a	If everyone could do that as well , that would be great .
17249	0	a	you each have individual actions , I ID Industrial Design you have your components concept , User Interface , the user interface concept , market trend wa watching .
17250	0	a	And as as per last time you will get specific incrat instructions from your personal coach e mailed to you .
17251	0	a	And hopefully , I hope , next time you will be able to access more of the web site
17252	0	a	that they they seem to tell you that you could .
17253	0	a	Yeah ,
17254	0	a	who knows .
17255	0	a	It is kind of frustrating ,
17256	0	a	but
17257	1	a	Be sure to note any frustrations or any issues that come up in your in your summary .
17258	0	a	Okay
17259	0	a	Sounds good .
17260	0	a	kay ?
17261	0	a	Great seeing you all .
17262	0	a	It is good .
17263	0	a	Did you
17264	0	a	were you able to like put yours in the group folder ?
17265	0	a	Okay .
17266	0	a	Yes , I just did that .
17267	0	a	Hopefully it is there for people .
17268	0	a	Yep .
17269	0	a	Yeah ?
17270	0	a	Yeah .
17271	0	a	Looks like there are looks like there is a second one kind of of mine that is that I did not do , it is from like an earlier project , I think
17272	0	a	so Under the shared folder , I do not know it might not even be under yours as well .
17273	0	a	Okay .
17274	0	a	Where is that ?
17275	0	a	Yours is
17276	0	a	I only have three , I just have like our three .
17277	0	a	Technical .
17278	0	a	So
17279	0	a	in there we have technical functions presentation , working design presentation and the functional requirements .
17280	0	a	Projects .
17281	0	a	At least that is what I have in .
17282	0	a	Yeah ,
17283	0	a	that is what I have as well , R Rose
17284	0	a	So .
17285	0	a	Yeah .
17286	0	a	Okay .
17287	0	a	You do not have mine ?
17288	0	a	S
17289	0	a	No , but that is cause I think yours is in the e mail separate , like it is not on the server .
17290	0	a	Yeah .
17291	1	a	But if I open it and then save it , probably will be there .
17292	1	a	Oh wait , never mind
17293	0	a	you ca not save it to the
17294	0	a	Okay .
17295	0	a	Well
17296	1	a	I will figure that out in the meantime .
17297	0	a	 
17298	0	a	yeah .
17299	0	a	Okay .
17300	0	a	I g
17301	0	a	yeah .
17302	0	a	Time is it ?
17303	0	a	Okay .
17304	0	a	Fourteen twenty six .
17305	0	a	Lovely to see you all again .
17306	0	a	it is our conceptual design meeting and it is starting at approximately fourteen twenty five
17307	0	a	and so we have forty minutes for this one again
17308	1	a	and so we will go just after three o'clock .
17309	0	a	okay
17310	0	a	our agenda , we are going to do an opening , I am going to review the minutes of the last meeting , then we will have your three presentations and then we will have to make a decision on the remote control concepts , and finally we will close .
17311	0	a	Okay .
17312	0	a	So
17313	0	a	opening .
17314	0	a	these are our minutes from r the functional design .
17315	0	a	We decided our target group is the focus on who can afford it , because we have international appeal and we said it is for all age groups , different functions of it .
17316	0	a	Our main objectives were simplicity and fashion .
17317	0	a	And s
17318	0	a	in
17319	0	a	specific functions are something to keep the remote from getting lost , large buttons for the essential functions , a possibility for extra functions , like a sliding a sliding piece and a long life battery or a charging station .
17320	0	a	Okay ,
17321	0	a	now three presentations .
17322	1	a	I would like to do it in this order , first do the conceptual specification of components , properties and materials and then the conceptual specification of user interface and finally trend watching .
17323	0	a	That would be me .
17324	0	a	Yep .
17325	0	a	Alright .
17326	0	a	Well .
17327	0	a	kay .
17328	0	a	Function F eight it .
17329	1	a	There we go .
17330	0	a	Alright .
17331	0	a	I am very excited by this one actually guys I had a lot of fun doing it .
17332	0	a	Components design .
17333	0	a	This is where you look at what does it take to make a remote control and what should we make our specific remote control out of .
17334	0	a	So ,
17335	1	a	we need to examine each element separately ,
17336	0	a	but we are designing a full thing , so you want to keep it integrated as a whole .
17337	0	a	The main elements of remote controls in general , and therefore ours as well , are the case , the buttons , the circuit board with the chip and the battery .
17338	0	a	These are all things that we had sort of addressed before ,
17339	1	a	but I am going to take each one a little bit separately here
17340	1	a	as we figure out what they should be made of and what they should look like .
17341	0	a	The case , the options that I have gotten from headquarters about what we can do , there is there is the shape of a case , we could do a flat sh a flat case , a curved case or maybe even a double double curved case .
17342	0	a	I have not seen any pictures of what this exactly looks like yet ,
17343	1	a	just keep that in mind ,
17344	0	a	but these are the options that we have from manufacturing and we can make our case out of plastic , the m the main base will be plastic , but we have all these sort of fashion and technological elements we can add in , wood , latex , titanium , rubber or other coloured types of plastic .
17345	0	a	That would be our case .
17346	0	a	buttons , for buttons we have pushbuttons , which is what Real Reaction uses the most often , but we also have scror scroll wheels , which can have integrated pushbuttons , or we could go all high tech and have an L LCD screen .
17347	0	a	circuit board and chip
17348	0	a	we can have a simple one , a regular one or an advanced one , depending on what our other needs are .
17349	0	a	And then battery I think is where things get most exciting .
17350	0	a	We are talking about long life batteries here .
17351	0	a	we can we can have your sort of basic double A batteries , but we also have these options of using a kinetic battery , like are used in high tech watches , where you just have to move it a little bit to get it to power up .
17352	0	a	so simple movements like pushing buttons would recharge the battery .
17353	0	a	Or a solar battery ,
17354	0	a	although there are slight complications with solar batteries
17355	0	a	as in we ca not use a latex case if we have a solar battery .
17356	0	a	Or something they only described as the type of battery you find in torches from about fifty years ago , flashlights .
17357	0	a	Not quite sure what that is , but that is the description that I received , so that is what I am passing on to you .
17358	0	a	So those are our options .
17359	0	a	personal preferences that I was thinking through here is what we have been talking about all through , fashion and simplicity .
17360	1	a	So if we are going for fashion in our cases , I think that what we are going to want to look at is a curved or a double curved case , probably with a variety of design elements .
17361	1	a	Maybe titanium , maybe some wood .
17362	1	a	We are going to have to investigate that better when I get specifics of the actual materials ,
17363	0	a	but that is sort of what I have in mind .
17364	0	a	And we want to go for simplicity .
17365	1	a	Probably pushbuttons ,
17366	0	a	but I am sort of intrigued by the idea of a scroll scroll wheel , if anyone has anything any ideas on that ?
17367	0	a	I mean I know the iPods and things right now have touch scroll buttons which are exactly like what they are describing ,
17368	1	a	so that might be something we want to look into .
17369	1	a	And I am really intrigued by the idea of a kinetic battery .
17370	0	a	Solar I do not think would be such a good idea ,
17371	0	a	because how often are you sure that your remote control will get a certain amount of light .
17372	0	a	But this idea of the kinetic , that you do not have to replace , and that a simple just shaking it around will make it work ,
17373	0	a	I think that that m would be a very interesting thing .
17374	1	a	But I think we would also want to go for e a simple chip or regular chip
17375	0	a	to keep our costs down .
17376	0	a	we really only need a regular or advanced chip t if we are going to start using an LCD .
17377	1	a	So I think we want to be aware of not making things overly t technological if they do not need to be ,
17378	0	a	cause that will keep our manufacturing price way down .
17379	0	a	That is what I have for options .
17380	0	a	I would appreciate anyone is input ,
17381	0	a	but that is what I am seeing for the future of the the look of this thing .
17382	0	a	Is double curved like would be like two hands kind of thing ?
17383	0	a	Okay .
17384	0	a	I am not sure .
17385	0	a	I have not received any specific visuals of this yet .
17386	0	a	Cause I am imagining like double curved is like , you know , like two sides that curve and then like one curve would just be like a single vertical ish kind of looking thing , but I have no idea .
17387	0	a	This is what I am sort of
17388	0	a	Yeah .
17389	0	a	I am not sure ,
17390	1	a	but I will let you know as soon as I get any pictures .
17391	0	a	Sounds good .
17392	0	a	Yeah , I wonder
17393	0	a	I know if we do have a double curved case , it ca not have any titanium in it .
17394	0	a	But the titanium , they were quite they are marketing quite hard to us as being used in the space programme ,
17395	0	a	so that could be quite interesting .
17396	1	a	Space age remote .
17397	1	a	Just all things to keep in mind .
17398	0	a	Just an interesting marketing kind of element .
17399	0	a	Yeah .
17400	0	a	That is about all I have to do , guys .
17401	0	a	I hope I did not go through that too quickly .
17402	1	a	just a real quick question
17403	0	a	the weight of these different elements , have you
17404	0	a	no idea , okay .
17405	0	a	Yeah ,
17406	0	a	n
17407	0	a	no idea , no idea .
17408	0	a	I am assuming that a kinetic battery is not going to take up that much weight , and that a tita titanium is very light , I know ,
17409	0	a	but other than
17410	0	a	that is really basic ,
17411	0	a	I mean , that is all I have gotten so far .
17412	0	a	Okay .
17413	0	a	Alright ?
17414	0	a	Any other questions ?
17415	0	a	No ?
17416	0	a	Okay .
17417	0	a	Uh huh .
17418	0	a	Do not think so .
17419	0	a	kay .
17420	0	a	I have save this in the shared projects , if anyone wants to look and I have c considerable notes on the topic as well , if anyone needs any more information .
17421	0	a	Thank you , perfect .
17422	0	a	Thanks .
17423	0	a	Just in my notebook ,
17424	1	a	but if anyone has any specific questions , do not hesitate to email me or something .
17425	1	a	if you made notes yourself you can put those on our underneath our
17426	0	a	oh , in your book ,
17427	0	a	then do not worry about that .
17428	0	a	Alright ?
17429	0	a	I guess I can
17430	0	a	I know .
17431	0	a	Kay
17432	1	a	now we are concepts concepts of user interface .
17433	0	a	Yeah , .
17434	0	a	This one is so much tighter than the other one .
17435	0	a	Okay .
17436	0	a	Nope .
17437	0	a	There we go .
17438	0	a	Here you are .
17439	0	a	Jess .
17440	0	a	G oh , geez .
17441	0	a	Alright , so
17442	1	a	I am going to describe the the concept of the user interface of this des device .
17443	0	a	we have talked about the two essential properties of the user interface .
17444	0	a	We want it to be simple and we want it to be fashionable .
17445	0	a	other
17446	0	a	we have also got to remember that this is a device that serves as a useful purpose .
17447	0	a	we want people to be able to use it s as a remote control ,
17448	1	a	so we need to determine what the essential functions of the d of the device are and make sure that we include that we have included all of those and that we actually end up with a device that is going to be useful to people .
17449	0	a	We have a number of different choices for a design concept
17450	1	a	and s that is that is something that that I will show you some examples of
17451	1	a	, but essentially we need to choose how how is this device going to work ,
17452	0	a	how how
17453	1	a	what kind of model is there going to be for user interaction with this device .
17454	1	a	once we have chosen a a concept for it , we can then design the features around the concept , making sure that we get all the essential functions in the device and the extra functions and the more advanced features .
17455	1	a	And of course we also have to make it look cool .
17456	0	a	So basically ,
17457	0	a	that is what we do not want .
17458	1	a	M we do not want lots of buttons , complicated features .
17459	1	a	We want something that looks nice and simple .
17460	0	a	Here is a a fairly simple device .
17461	0	a	This is an an iPod from Apple .
17462	0	a	I think the main thing to notice about it is it just has four buttons .
17463	0	a	It is very minimalistic in its design .
17464	0	a	you use these four buttons to m to move around a range of settings on the small LCD screen .
17465	0	a	the thing I like about this is that it is very very quick to access the main features .
17466	0	a	you can just about make out that the button three buttons are previous track , next track and play pause .
17467	0	a	They are the main the main features of the iPod , the things you will use a all the time .
17468	0	a	then if you want to do anything more advanced , you go into the little menu on the LCD screen and you use the buttons just to scroll around and and find the more advanced features that you want .
17469	1	a	So I think that is that is a good a good kind of model that we could have .
17470	0	a	here is a another example .
17471	0	a	This is it is an interesting idea
17472	0	a	and I think i it looks pretty cool .
17473	0	a	it is certainly got novelty value .
17474	0	a	it is nice and colourful , it is nice and bright .
17475	0	a	it is also something that you can kind of feel your way around .
17476	0	a	The buttons are are different shapes
17477	0	a	and and you can sort of
17478	0	a	yeah
17479	0	a	if you are watching TV in the dark or whatever , you can work out which button is which
17480	0	a	and basically , yeah
17481	0	a	it is ith it is fun .
17482	0	a	So
17483	0	a	I I like I like this idea of just having buttons for the features that you use most often .
17484	1	a	So you would need a few buttons to select your favourite channels .
17485	0	a	I mean most people , when they watch TV , they have two hundred and fifty channels on their TV and they watch of about four of them at the most .
17486	0	a	So ,
17487	1	a	you have buttons for your favourite channel , changing the volume ,
17488	0	a	which is something you do all the time when you are watching TV ,
17489	1	a	and the button to switch it off , in case you get bored .
17490	0	a	other features , things like adjusting the brightness , tuning the TV , I do not know what else you do with a TV .
17491	0	a	but these are these are all necessary functions .
17492	0	a	you ca not have a t
17493	0	a	there is no point having a television that you ca not tune or that you ca not set the contrast ,
17494	1	a	so we need to find a way of including these somehow .
17495	1	a	and one other suggestions I would make is to in is to include in a menu system , a bit like on the iPod .
17496	0	a	So
17497	1	a	we would either have a small LCD display on the device itself , or have a dis a menu display that comes up on your television and can b be controlled through the device .
17498	0	a	And that would allow you to access access the advanced features whilst keeping a very small and simple set of buttons for the features that you use most often .
17499	0	a	Okay .
17500	0	a	So you would be advocating an LCD then ?
17501	0	a	Okay .
17502	0	a	I think that is that is one way to go ,
17503	0	a	yes .
17504	0	a	I mean there are there are advantages and disadvantages if you if you have an LCD display ,
17505	0	a	it is it is nice ,
17506	0	a	because it is it it lets you just sort of sit there and st and control your television from your armchair .
17507	0	a	There are disadvantages ,
17508	0	a	an an LCD display would have to be quite small ,
17509	0	a	cause we are we are I
17510	0	a	well
17511	0	a	we are
17512	0	a	I assume we are going to be making quite a small device .
17513	1	a	it would also have to have a kind of backlighting in it ,
17514	0	a	cause you ten you tend to watch TV in the dark , but you need to be able to see your LDD LCD display .
17515	0	a	Right
17516	0	a	Right .
17517	1	a	The alternative is to have a an on screen display on your television that you control through your remote control .
17518	0	a	a bit like a bit like how they have these digital boxes where you you press the buttons and it comes up with your this thing of watch lo what is on each channel .
17519	0	a	I mean that that is also a good idea .
17520	0	a	Okay .
17521	0	a	It is
17522	0	a	it can it does have it is problems as well ,
17523	0	a	if you have got a small TV and you are sitting on the other side of a room , it is hard to read the little text that comes up .
17524	0	a	but that is a that is a design decision that we can make .
17525	0	a	Kay .
17526	0	a	I do think that one of the important features for a remote is seeing a menu and seeing what is on .
17527	0	a	and so
17528	0	a	like favourite channels is is applicable ,
17529	1	a	but I think th that you do need to have some kind of function where it is you have t you can see the title of the show or possibly a description of it .
17530	0	a	Yeah .
17531	0	a	Well
17532	0	a	Are you are you tak
17533	0	a	Yeah .
17534	0	a	Yeah .
17535	0	a	Like
17536	0	a	I I know I use that often enough .
17537	1	a	Wait ,
17538	0	a	but is that separate from what he was saying ?
17539	0	a	Should I plug that in ?
17540	0	a	Maybe it is just not
17541	0	a	Is it on ?
17542	0	a	Ri
17543	1	a	What F do you have to press ,
17544	0	a	five ?
17545	0	a	I just keep pressing lots of them .
17546	0	a	Well
17547	0	a	if it if it was a L LCD on th on the remote , I do not know that you could f that you would be able to see a
17548	0	a	Okay .
17549	0	a	No , I think I think we are talking menu like contrast and tuning the VCR or something if I have understood you correctly , rather than menu as what is on .
17550	0	a	Yeah , that that would be one of the features , yes .
17551	0	a	Okay .
17552	0	a	But it is it is it is
17553	0	a	something to bear in mind is that if we put a display on the remote control the c communication is one way , so you ca not have the televisions and information back to the remote control , at least I do not think you can .
17554	0	a	Cause that would be more specifically a digital box ,
17555	0	a	Oh ,
17556	0	a	good point .
17557	0	a	I am not sure .
17558	0	a	Yeah .
17559	0	a	Okay ,
17560	1	a	now we are moving on to market .
17561	1	a	Marketing .
17562	0	a	Is that going on ?
17563	0	a	Okay .
17564	0	a	that should be alright , actually .
17565	1	a	Eight .
17566	0	a	Well ,
17567	0	a	I do not know how relevant all of this going to be .
17568	0	a	If anything , the that they gave me .
17569	0	a	No signal .
17570	0	a	Oops ,
17571	0	a	it is not plugged in , quite in well enough .
17572	0	a	Alright .
17573	0	a	There we are .
17574	0	a	Oop ,
17575	1	a	there we go .
17576	1	a	kay .
17577	0	a	Oh yeah .
17578	0	a	Okay , so
17579	1	a	we are going to look a little bit at trend watching .
17580	0	a	Basically , I was given an executive summary that was a market investigation on remote controls that was recently conducted , and then also some fashion watchers in Paris and Milan commented on some things that are going to be going on this year .
17581	0	a	So
17582	0	a	first they had people they ranked the important aspects of r remote controls , and right now i d they are saying that currently there is a functional look and feel preference , but that really , over the next year it
17583	0	a	it that is going to be switching to fancy look and feel remotes , so that just goes back to the whole desire of our c Real Reaction company wanting to focus on fashion
17584	0	a	and so ,
17585	0	a	even though we are stressing , when we are talking , we have all been talking about this like simplicity and easy to use idea , they are sort of wanting us to remember that the number one thing for everyone is that it is fancy look and feel .
17586	0	a	And as these are ranked , the top one is doubly important to the second one , which is doubly important to the third one ,
17587	1	a	so just to take that weight into account .
17588	0	a	Okay .
17589	0	a	The second thing that was mentioned as important was the technological innovations .
17590	0	a	That would be like if we use something like the space material or the LCD screen , things like that .
17591	0	a	And then ease of use was the third most important ,
17592	0	a	whi
17593	0	a	so
17594	1	a	really , no matter what , we need to focus the most on fancy look and feel , according to this .
17595	0	a	I do not know how much we agree with that .
17596	0	a	And then the fashion watch talks about that this year is top trend for clothes , shoes and furniture is fruits and vegetables and
17597	0	a	tha
17598	0	a	that there is a preference for spongy , tight material .
17599	0	a	S
17600	0	a	sweet .
17601	1	a	And so that brings us to my personal preferences .
17602	0	a	Who wants a spongy remote or one with fruit and vegetable padding .
17603	1	a	Personally , I do not really think that I want one that is going to go out of style or go stale , excuse the pun , in a year , so
17604	0	a	even though this is coming from us as , you know , trend watch , market research ,
17605	0	a	I do not know how much of it we necessarily want to take away .
17606	0	a	Also , considering that the d research b has been carried out by Real Reaction , I am a little hesitant as to like , how these questions may have been worded , and if necessarily this whole fashion to technology y edas ease of use is necessarily the right ranking .
17607	0	a	Personally , like I might reverse it ,
17608	1	a	but if we are working for this company then I guess no matter what , we have to stress fashion the most .
17609	1	a	But it does not necessarily need to be a spongy material .
17610	0	a	That
17611	0	a	there is all kinds of scope for imagination in that one though .
17612	0	a	Yeah .
17613	0	a	I do not have a lot of notes to share if you want them , that pretty much sums it up .
17614	0	a	So yeah .
17615	0	a	Okay ,
17616	1	a	do we have any s some questions for this ,
17617	1	a	let is see .
17618	0	a	Yeah ,
17619	0	a	what can I possibly enlighten on ?
17620	1	a	do you have any ideas how to possibly use these ?
17621	1	a	how to how to use a fruit or vegetable or or the spongy material at all ?
17622	0	a	Like
17623	1	a	could we make a s like could we make a spongy remote ?
17624	0	a	It would be easier on the hands .
17625	0	a	If it is latex if it is latexy
17626	0	a	, mean
17627	0	a	An I if th
17628	1	a	my understanding of a latex case is that it is in fact hard to protect stuff inside , but that it is covered with the latex ,
17629	0	a	which is spongier and softer on your hands .
17630	0	a	It is kind of and then it
17631	1	a	we would have to find a way to protect like the chip and all that ,
17632	0	a	I dunno .
17633	0	a	A kind of thing that
17634	0	a	Yeah .
17635	0	a	But
17636	0	a	It is
17637	0	a	there is something to be said , I mean we we got that thing earlier from you about not wanting it to R R repetitive stress injuries and things
17638	0	a	and and
17639	0	a	Yeah ,
17640	1	a	something grippable ,
17641	0	a	I mean we do not we do not we do not want to go spongy , maybe .
17642	0	a	Yeah ,
17643	0	a	so something , m m instead of a necess
17644	0	a	yeah , grip ,
17645	1	a	I am thinking grip more than like sinking into your hands ,
17646	0	a	you know ,
17647	0	a	i and I think
17648	1	a	I am envisioning more like , you know , the material that you have when you sit on like a bicycle ,
17649	0	a	so that it does not hurt when you are sitting down for a long time ,
17650	0	a	like
17651	1	a	I am imagining that sort of thing ,
17652	0	a	I do not know what th that material is called .
17653	0	a	Yeah .
17654	0	a	Yeah .
17655	0	a	Yeah .
17656	0	a	Yeah , I think that given the list of materials
17657	0	a	I w
17658	0	a	I was forwarded
17659	0	a	it is that seems doable .
17660	0	a	could we go in fruit and vegetable colours ?
17661	1	a	We could colour co ordinate them ,
17662	0	a	li
17663	1	a	The buttons could be fruit shaped .
17664	0	a	F for sure ,
17665	1	a	or maybe like couple main ones being like , I dunno , lemons or strawberries or something .
17666	0	a	Could they be smelly ?
17667	0	a	I do not know .
17668	0	a	I Is it supposed to be shaped like a vegetable ?
17669	0	a	like I dunno , like carrots or something .
17670	0	a	Oh well
17671	0	a	it is quite easy to s shape thing like carrot
17672	0	a	is not it ?
17673	1	a	Or maybe the buttons could be shaped like different fruits .
17674	0	a	Oh God .
17675	0	a	Or carrot shaped ,
17676	0	a	Maybe ,
17677	0	a	or
17678	0	a	Kind of like a potato .
17679	1	a	Like large button ,
17680	0	a	that is what I was thinking of ,
17681	0	a	yeah .
17682	0	a	What about the idea of like a round remote ?
17683	0	a	Instead of like a vertical up and down one .
17684	0	a	Like in terms of holding it .
17685	0	a	Like that is a f shape of a fruit .
17686	0	a	be
17687	0	a	yeah .
17688	0	a	It would be harder to f bu buttons I think .
17689	0	a	Just to tie it in a little .
17690	0	a	Might
17691	0	a	would you think you you do you think you would be able to hold it ?
17692	0	a	Cause I think the reason they are long is
17693	0	a	yeah .
17694	0	a	Yeah .
17695	0	a	It would be harder to press button .
17696	0	a	Depends .
17697	0	a	Harder to push .
17698	0	a	When you when you use a remote , do you press the buttons with your thumb , usually ?
17699	0	a	Or your fingers ?
17700	1	a	Or maybe you want something that is shaped like a mobile phone ,
17701	0	a	so you you hold it in one hand , and you press the buttons with your thumb .
17702	0	a	Yeah .
17703	0	a	I
17704	0	a	Yeah , that is ts how I tend to do it .
17705	0	a	I usually hold it in one hand .
17706	0	a	Maybe
17707	0	a	But then the buttons would have to be very small .
17708	0	a	Yeah ,
17709	0	a	cause otherwise your fingers ca not move around .
17710	0	a	Do not you think ?
17711	0	a	But I mean in order to get to all of them ,
17712	0	a	you know .
17713	0	a	No just thumb sized .
17714	0	a	Jus
17715	0	a	Yeah .
17716	0	a	But I like i
17717	0	a	I love the idea of the wheel like the iPod .
17718	0	a	Yeah .
17719	1	a	They would have to be within a certain amount of space with each other .
17720	0	a	Maybe .
17721	0	a	That is true .
17722	0	a	But if you have only got like four or five buttons anyway , then it is it is not so much a problem , perhaps .
17723	0	a	Right .
17724	0	a	I
17725	0	a	When I am when I am pressing buttons on my iPod , that is how I do it , hold it and press the four .
17726	0	a	So you hold it in one hand and you press you press the buttons with your thumb
17727	0	a	and
17728	0	a	And you find that works quite well ?
17729	0	a	Is that
17730	0	a	The button on an iPod , is it what is it , is it just four buttons or is it li more like a scroll thing ?
17731	0	a	Right .
17732	0	a	Yeah .
17733	0	a	Yeah ,
17734	0	a	or in
17735	0	a	and use my thumb or my pointer finger on the touch scroll wheel .
17736	0	a	Yeah
17737	0	a	It
17738	0	a	wel well
17739	0	a	yeah ,
17740	0	a	it would
17741	0	a	I mean each version of it has been a little bit different ,
17742	0	a	but
17743	0	a	Oh yeah ,
17744	0	a	you had one of the in between ones , when they were not doing that anymore .
17745	0	a	Cause th
17746	0	a	It is like five , cause there is one in the middle .
17747	0	a	It is a scroll ,
17748	0	a	yeah , it is a wheel .
17749	0	a	The one I have does not have the four on i like around it , I do not think .
17750	0	a	Ts
17751	0	a	and you press the centre button ,
17752	0	a	that is that is your all purpose select button right there .
17753	0	a	Oh , I see , right , yeah .
17754	0	a	Oh , okay .
17755	0	a	Since it is the one in the centre that is not marked , yeah .
17756	0	a	Yeah , that is quite a good design .
17757	1	a	I think why it would be good for us is cause like you could have the same wheel sort of effect for like channel flipping and then the other one could be like for volume .
17758	0	a	Yeah .
17759	0	a	Like just the idea of like those
17760	1	a	so few buttons for main things , but then how you could go back to the menu
17761	0	a	and like ,
17762	0	a	I dunno
17763	1	a	if we would want it on the screen there or on the actual TV .
17764	0	a	t
17765	0	a	Yeah .
17766	1	a	I kind of am wanting to say on the TV ,
17767	0	a	cause if you are changing the brightness , do not you want to see it happening , kind of ?
17768	0	a	And then you could still have that available .
17769	0	a	Yeah .
17770	0	a	Yeah .
17771	0	a	Yeah , I think an LCD screen might be good in theory , but not as useful in practice .
17772	0	a	I think it could be difficult in practice ,
17773	0	a	yeah .
17774	0	a	Yeah .
17775	0	a	Also z yeah , cause you would be z looking down at the LCD screen , than back up at your TV and people do not want to do that .
17776	0	a	Right .
17777	0	a	Oh
17778	1	a	we probably have to get going ,
17779	0	a	do not we ?
17780	0	a	Kay .
17781	0	a	Okay
17782	0	a	we have we have about fifteen minutes left ,
17783	1	a	so I am I am going to continue with my pres presentation .
17784	0	a	I have one more slide before we close , but in that slide is when we need to make decisions about this these kinds of things ,
17785	1	a	so I will just bring that up and show you all
17786	1	a	before we move on .
17787	0	a	Yeah ,
17788	1	a	and then like the the covers could be spongy latex
17789	0	a	wherea
17790	1	a	but the actual model could be titanium .
17791	1	a	If I get any more information of fruits and vegetables , I will let you know .
17792	0	a	Could Could we could we have changeable covers like for your mobile ?
17793	0	a	In different fruit and vegetable colours ,
17794	0	a	yeah .
17795	0	a	Like , to make it different fruits .
17796	0	a	Yeah , it is possible .
17797	0	a	Exactly .
17798	1	a	And you could co ordinate with your house or whatever .
17799	0	a	I think maybe th the packaging ,
17800	1	a	it should be like a lemon and the the packaging is like the peel .
17801	0	a	All these options .
17802	0	a	So instead of opening the box you just kind of peel it , and the remote control is inside .
17803	0	a	Ooh .
17804	0	a	Well ,
17805	0	a	there we go .
17806	0	a	Oh .
17807	0	a	Do not know .
17808	0	a	The iPod packaging is me like was so that was like half the fun .
17809	0	a	It is like the way it all comes all cute .
17810	0	a	Yeah .
17811	0	a	Lemons ?
17812	0	a	Yeah ,
17813	0	a	I mean ,
17814	0	a	it would t totally take care of our problem of not wanting to change batteries .
17815	0	a	Options .
17816	0	a	Okay ,
17817	0	a	components concept .
17818	0	a	Energy , chip on print .
17819	0	a	Uh hu
17820	0	a	oh ,
17821	0	a	oh yes .
17822	0	a	Right ,
17823	0	a	I had sort of skipped over that hoping it would not get be necessary
17824	0	a	but
17825	0	a	Alright ,
17826	0	a	so
17827	0	a	decisions ,
17828	0	a	what the
17829	0	a	okay
17830	1	a	deci decisions on energy I am thinking is based on the battery .
17831	0	a	G
17832	0	a	That is th th this is the agenda they gave me .
17833	0	a	So
17834	1	a	can you just explain what that is real quick ?
17835	0	a	I dunno ,
17836	0	a	what do people think about this kinetic battery idea ?
17837	0	a	Am I
17838	0	a	Yeah .
17839	0	a	I think it is awesome .
17840	0	a	I think it is really cool .
17841	0	a	Yeah .
17842	0	a	Yeah , I think it is good ,
17843	1	a	as as long as we consider the the cost and the how reliable it is ,
17844	0	a	but as far as I know , the technology is good .
17845	0	a	Right ,
17846	0	a	I have not gotten any
17847	0	a	yeah ,
17848	0	a	any more information on cost other than it is more expensive than a regular battery , but but if we are using a an i a cheaper chip , then it will even out , I think .
17849	0	a	Costs .
17850	0	a	But over time
17851	0	a	Yeah ,
17852	0	a	it is a
17853	0	a	But if you c if you could scroll through the channels , and then the volume would just be and the volume would just be like the same way , forward and backward as I am just thinking like it would make it much like sleeker sort of looking .
17854	1	a	circuit boards .
17855	0	a	yeah ,
17856	0	a	I got a whole bunch of information on how circuit boards are produced .
17857	0	a	They are they are thin fibreglass with copper wires etched on to them , and di
17858	0	a	I think they are quite easily printed on by machine , which is chip on print is where the machine prints on the wires and solders it all together for us .
17859	1	a	I do not really know what to tell you as far as decisions .
17860	0	a	I was not really given any options , I was just given that this is how they are done .
17861	0	a	Okay .
17862	0	a	yeah ,
17863	0	a	I ca not ca not really tell you .
17864	0	a	I can I can tell you a whole lot about how it works .
17865	1	a	But I do not know any decisions on
17866	0	a	Yeah .
17867	0	a	If they are if they are really options .
17868	0	a	I am sorry ,
17869	0	a	I did f
17870	0	a	Yeah .
17871	0	a	Okay .
17872	0	a	Al all circuit boards are pretty much the same , I think .
17873	0	a	it is fairly fairly standard .
17874	0	a	okay ,
17875	1	a	then we will move on to the case .
17876	0	a	oh
17877	0	a	bu
17878	1	a	I guess maybe if we decided on like a simple , a regular , or an advanced chip , maybe .
17879	0	a	Right .
17880	0	a	Well okay ,
17881	1	a	here is the here is the thing on the chips that I that I got .
17882	0	a	simple , regular , advanced chip on print .
17883	0	a	The chip on print includes an infrared sensor , so we do not have to worry about that .
17884	0	a	, kay ,
17885	0	a	the pushbutton
17886	0	a	if we are going to have pushbuttons , they require a simple chip , but a scroll wheel requires a regular chip , and an LCD requires advanced .
17887	0	a	Do we want a scroll wheel , or do we just want pushbuttons ?
17888	0	a	Oh .
17889	0	a	I do not think we ne really need the scroll whe wheel .
17890	0	a	I mean it might be nice for changing the volume .
17891	0	a	It would be nice for changing the volume , but I do not know how useful it would be for changing the channel .
17892	0	a	but
17893	0	a	I do not think it would really work .
17894	0	a	Cause you do not have control over numbers
17895	0	a	or
17896	0	a	We have five minutes left for the meeting , so .
17897	0	a	Yeah ,
17898	1	a	you really need buttons for changing a channel .
17899	0	a	Yeah ,
17900	0	a	th it would be it would be handy for going through
17901	1	a	if there was an on screen menu of your channel choices , than you can scroll down on the scroll .
17902	0	a	Yeah .
17903	0	a	Yeah .
17904	0	a	Yeah .
17905	0	a	Yeah .
17906	0	a	And otherwise , no matter how may buttons we have , we are going to have like , you know , black with red sticking out
17907	0	a	and th no
17908	0	a	it is going to inevitably sort of start looking like those group of sort of ugly ones that we saw stacked up .
17909	0	a	Yeah .
17910	0	a	Yeah .
17911	0	a	So ,
17912	0	a	have a scroll for volume ?
17913	0	a	F
17914	0	a	F
17915	0	a	or for all those secret functions ?
17916	1	a	When you get on the on screen menu of all your functions that your remote could do for you without the buttons and you could have a scroll wheel to go through those menus .
17917	0	a	I think
17918	0	a	yeah ,
17919	0	a	I think a scroll wheel would be nice , but it is not necessary .
17920	0	a	Right .
17921	0	a	Yeah .
17922	1	a	So we could either go with a simple or a regular chip , depending and maybe we could table that decision for later .
17923	0	a	I do not know .
17924	0	a	I think w
17925	0	a	well
17926	1	a	I think when we go on to the une userface , we are going to have to decide the interface we are going to have to decide whether we are going to have a scroll or not .
17927	0	a	Okay .
17928	0	a	Well ,
17929	1	a	let is think about that while we talk about the case .
17930	0	a	Okay ,
17931	1	a	let is do case .
17932	0	a	I am kind of liking the idea of latex , if if spongy is the in thing .
17933	0	a	I am a little I am a little hesitant about it ,
17934	0	a	because I am worried about protecting the stuff on the inside .
17935	0	a	Okay .
17936	0	a	Yeah , I would be more okay with like a titanium actual thing and then maybe like a mobile phone kind of thing .
17937	0	a	Oh
17938	0	a	could it be hard , and then something around it ?
17939	0	a	I am thinking curved of some sort .
17940	0	a	yeah ,
17941	0	a	everything I have N
17942	0	a	oh wha what I have
17943	0	a	what I have seen , just not related to this , but of latex cases before , is that there is like a hard plastic inside , and it is just covered with the latex .
17944	0	a	Okay .
17945	0	a	Not too thick a layer of latex , just enough to be grippable , like bike handles or or anything that you have seen like that .
17946	0	a	Okay .
17947	0	a	The inside is hard .
17948	0	a	I do not think we need to worry about protecting the circuit board , I think that that is done for us .
17949	0	a	Ge o
17950	0	a	Okay .
17951	0	a	Kay .
17952	0	a	Yeah .
17953	0	a	So
17954	0	a	we we do want latex .
17955	0	a	Yeah .
17956	0	a	Yeah .
17957	0	a	Okay .
17958	0	a	Latex .
17959	0	a	and probably in colours , maybe fruity , vegetable colours .
17960	0	a	Yeah .
17961	0	a	Fruity colours .
17962	0	a	Okay
17963	1	a	let is go to the ufe user interface then we will come back to the chip I suppose .
17964	0	a	Oh
17965	1	a	and we want a curved case ,
17966	0	a	yeah ?
17967	0	a	Or a double curved ?
17968	0	a	Yeah , okay .
17969	0	a	Well ,
17970	0	a	we do not really know what the difference is ,
17971	0	a	right ?
17972	0	a	Yeah .
17973	0	a	Yeah .
17974	0	a	We do not really know what the difference Good point .
17975	0	a	okay ,
17976	1	a	interface , the type and the supplements .
17977	0	a	So
17978	0	a	push or scroll , right ?
17979	0	a	Or both ?
17980	0	a	Yep .
17981	0	a	And I think if we want to keep our costs down , we should just go for pushbuttons ,
17982	0	a	cause then we can have a a simple chip
17983	0	a	and it is simpler , it is it is cheaper to make pushbuttons than it is a scroll button .
17984	0	a	So in terms of in terms of economics it is probably better to have pushbuttons .
17985	1	a	And if we had a sc an on screen kind of thing that you could scroll through , like you can use your buttons to scroll through things .
17986	0	a	Yeah ,
17987	0	a	yeah , it is it is it is fairly simple .
17988	0	a	I think that
17989	0	a	yeah .
17990	0	a	For channel surfing I think a scroll an actual like an iPod is kind of scroll thing would be too fast , I dunno .
17991	0	a	Yeah .
17992	0	a	I say pushbuttons at least unless we get any information
17993	0	a	but I have no idea how much more expensive a scroll wheel is than than a pushbutton , but it is gotta be some more expensive ,
17994	0	a	so
17995	1	a	I think it might be better to put our money into the stuff like the kinetic battery and the cool case
17996	0	a	because
17997	0	a	Yeah .
17998	0	a	Yeah .
17999	0	a	Yeah .
18000	0	a	Is that okay with you ?
18001	0	a	How you feeling ?
18002	0	a	Yeah .
18003	1	a	And let is like see if we get anything else .
18004	0	a	I mean I am not like hard sold on the scroll wheel , it is more just to give it a different kind of look , but if it is going to be in a latex type thing and that is going to look cool , then that is probably going to have a bigger impact than the scroll wheel .
18005	0	a	It might be cool enough .
18006	0	a	Okay , so
18007	1	a	we are going to go with type pushbuttons , and then supplements ,
18008	1	a	how are we going to do that ?
18009	0	a	I assume that is what else we are going to like h ha the the additional buttons we can use .
18010	0	a	Yep .
18011	0	a	what do you mean by supplements , exactly ?
18012	0	a	Yep .
18013	0	a	Oh .
18014	0	a	So we are going to have like a menu button , so that we can access on screen things then ?
18015	0	a	Okay ,
18016	0	a	so
18017	1	a	we are doing an on screen menu that we can scroll through .
18018	0	a	Yeah .
18019	0	a	Alright .
18020	0	a	in
18021	0	a	Yeah .
18022	0	a	So
18023	1	a	what are what are our buttons going to be ?
18024	1	a	On off
18025	0	a	So like one through five , or
18026	0	a	No .
18027	0	a	On off ,
18028	1	a	volume , favourite channels , and menu .
18029	0	a	Yeah , yeah
18030	0	a	about
18031	0	a	yeah like
18032	0	a	yeah ,
18033	0	a	a bit like radio presets .
18034	0	a	Like a radio type sorta situation ?
18035	0	a	we would not even need the numbers .
18036	0	a	Pre set channels
18037	1	a	and then we are going to need numbers one through zero ,
18038	0	a	right ?
18039	0	a	Well ,
18040	0	a	but in order to pre set a cha
18041	0	a	oh
18042	1	a	I guess you can just hold it down when you get to one when you are scrolling through .
18043	0	a	I think maybe numbers seems is kind of old fashioned .
18044	0	a	Yeah , yeah ,
18045	0	a	you can just
18046	0	a	and you need some kind of , I dunno , sort of up down kind of button ,
18047	1	a	but the volume control could double for that , for example .
18048	0	a	Yeah , up down .
18049	0	a	Okay ,
18050	1	a	finishing the meeting now .
18051	0	a	our next meeting starts in thirty minutes , you each have things to do , look and feel design , user interface design , product evaluation , and you two are going to work together on a prototype using modelling clay .
18052	0	a	You will get specific instructions from your personal coach .
18053	0	a	Ooh .
18054	0	a	Cool .
18055	0	a	did we decide on a chip ?
18056	1	a	Let is go with a simple chip ?
18057	0	a	Okay .
18058	0	a	Simple chip .
18059	0	a	Yep .
18060	0	a	We are done .
18061	0	a	Thank you everyone .
18062	0	a	Oh
18063	0	a	I di
18064	0	a	Okay , cool .
18065	0	a	Clay .
18066	0	a	 
18067	0	a	Okay ,
18068	0	a	welcome to our detailed design meeting .
18069	0	a	I am pretty excited .
18070	1	a	Let is start
18071	0	a	it is approximately fifteen forty or something like that .
18072	0	a	Okay
18073	0	a	the agenda we are going to do an opening
18074	0	a	and then I will talk about the minutes from the last meeting , what we d discussed , then we will have the prototype presentation and a look at the evaluation criteria .
18075	0	a	We will look at the finances and finally a do a production evaluation and close .
18076	0	a	So ,
18077	1	a	starting off with the last the last one ,
18078	0	a	oh
18079	0	a	I do not have it here , but we talked about energy , we are going to use a kinetic battery , we want to use a simple chip , because we are not going to need a a shuffle , we are going to need a scroll , we are choosing a latex case w in fruity colours that is curved and we are using push buttons with a supplement of an on screen menu .
18080	0	a	And it sounded like we had set like eight or nine buttons , including five pre set channels .
18081	0	a	Okay ?
18082	1	a	Let is do the look and feel design presentation first .
18083	0	a	Right ,
18084	1	a	do you want to start ?
18085	0	a	Okay ,
18086	0	a	What
18087	0	a	We call that one the rhombus , the rhombus .
18088	0	a	Right , well
18089	0	a	we made three different prototypes
18090	1	a	and I guess we will start with with this one .
18091	0	a	we have
18092	0	a	our colours not are not fixed , but this is the general shape .
18093	0	a	it is
18094	0	a	you hold it sort of either like like this in your left hand
18095	0	a	or you switch it over
18096	0	a	and it is easily adaptable to either hand .
18097	0	a	You can push the buttons with your thumb like a mobile phone , or you can push them with your index finger of your other hand ,
18098	0	a	or even
18099	0	a	I mean there is a whole variety , you can hold it like this and press it with your same index finger .
18100	0	a	we have the on off button at the tip , very visible , very big .
18101	0	a	We have our up and down buttons , which are also going to be our channel selectors , and we have our little menu button here .
18102	0	a	If you push if you are just pushing these normally , they are the menu buttons , if the volume buttons rather .
18103	0	a	If you press select once , they become channel changing buttons .
18104	0	a	If we press select three times , the menu with the other features and pro possibly also with your TV channel choices shows up , and you have your five presets down here .
18105	1	a	if people want to grab hold of that , see how it feels in your hand .
18106	0	a	That is our number one prototype .
18107	0	a	do you want to present the potato , or shall I present the Martian ?
18108	0	a	That is the rhombus , yep .
18109	0	a	like a little lightning in it .
18110	0	a	The little lightning bolt in it , very cute .
18111	0	a	I could
18112	0	a	Could the middle button of the on screen menu function as a power button ?
18113	1	a	If you like held it down , that would be on off .
18114	0	a	The v the rhombus rhombus ?
18115	0	a	on , off ?
18116	0	a	Okay .
18117	0	a	this one is known as the potato ,
18118	0	a	it is it is a
18119	0	a	how can I present it ?
18120	0	a	It is an ergonomic shape ,
18121	0	a	so it it fits in your hand nicely .
18122	0	a	it is designed to be used either in your left hand or or in your right hand .
18123	0	a	I have gone here just for just for four buttons on this one .
18124	0	a	the two blue buttons here are for adjusting the volume .
18125	0	a	So you have got volume up and volume down on the other side here .
18126	0	a	the red ones are for changing channels , channel up and channel down and that is moves between your favourite channels that you have selected .
18127	0	a	this middle button here brings up the on screen menu and when you are working in the on screen menu you use the other four buttons to navigate around the menu system and the middle button to select and that is basically it , that is the potato .
18128	0	a	that would be one of your channels , basically , so like channel zero would be t to switch switch the machine off ,
18129	0	a	yeah .
18130	0	a	Yeah we turn it off .
18131	0	a	not really ,
18132	0	a	it would make it hard to turn the machine off , to turn your TV off .
18133	1	a	If you pressed and held it maybe .
18134	0	a	Yeah
18135	0	a	yeah ,
18136	0	a	that that would be one way of doing it ,
18137	0	a	yeah .
18138	0	a	Yeah .
18139	0	a	That would work , yeah .
18140	0	a	On off , that is a possibility ,
18141	0	a	yeah .
18142	0	a	Okay .
18143	0	a	And then finally we have the Martian or the pear , either way .
18144	0	a	it is a bit different , just a little bit more of a creative feel .
18145	0	a	you have the on off toggle stem on the top .
18146	0	a	We have the five preset seeds .
18147	0	a	And then you have on the sides to make it a little bit more three dimensional , you have your channel changing , volume changing buttons and your menu button right here in the middle .
18148	0	a	So ,
18149	1	a	that is for your consideration as well ,
18150	0	a	plus it is an interesting talking point to have standing up .
18151	1	a	Let is pass .
18152	1	a	We figured it could stand up like this on your table , if you wanted it to , if I made the bot the bottom flat .
18153	0	a	Uh huh .
18154	0	a	Sorry ,
18155	0	a	what is the yellow one in the middle ,
18156	0	a	I forgot .
18157	0	a	the menu select button .
18158	0	a	Very interesting .
18159	0	a	I think that one is my favourite .
18160	0	a	So that is
18161	0	a	So that is our three prototypes .
18162	0	a	basically ,
18163	1	a	in terms of making decisions , what we would need to do is first of all decide on a form which of the three different shapes we want , then decide what kind of button layout we want , how many buttons , and then to choose what colours we want to make the buttons and if we want to put any text on the device , like label on the buttons or put a brand name or or a logo on it or whatever .
18164	0	a	We were we were thinking that
18165	0	a	normally we would go for fruity colours , but maybe we are also thinking that your sort of middle aged man , for an example customer , might not want a fruity coloured remote ,
18166	1	a	so m maybe we would have one version that is a bit toned down , maybe with with less contrasts on it .
18167	0	a	kay .
18168	0	a	Yeah ,
18169	1	a	something still a little bright to make it hard to lose , but
18170	0	a	yeah .
18171	0	a	Would
18172	0	a	Yeah ,
18173	1	a	but we do not want it to look like a kids' toy .
18174	0	a	Now
18175	0	a	that was one thing that we brought up over email .
18176	0	a	I do not know if you picked up your email ,
18177	0	a	but the f the feature that we considered for it not getting lost .
18178	0	a	Yeah .
18179	0	a	Right .
18180	0	a	Well
18181	0	a	we were we were talking about that a little bit when we got that email
18182	0	a	and we think that each of these are so distinctive , that it it is not just like another piece of technology around your house .
18183	0	a	It is going to be somewhere that it can be seen .
18184	0	a	So we are we are not thinking that it is going to be as critical to have the loss
18185	0	a	I think
18186	0	a	Yeah .
18187	0	a	But if it is like under covers or like in a couch you still ca not see it .
18188	0	a	It is really
18189	0	a	Would it be very difficult to just have an external device that like I dunno , you tape to your to your TV
18190	0	a	that when you press it
18191	0	a	you ha
18192	0	a	a little light beep goes off ?
18193	0	a	Do you think that would be conceptually possible ?
18194	0	a	I think it would be difficult technologically ,
18195	0	a	because if your if your remote is lost it is probably under the settee and in that case
18196	0	a	you ca not you ca not send an infrared sing signal to it to find it ,
18197	0	a	s so it is
18198	0	a	I am not quite sure how it would work
18199	0	a	and then I wonder if it is if it is more just a gimmick then anything else .
18200	0	a	That is true , kay .
18201	0	a	I mean
18202	0	a	ho how many times do you really , seriously lose your remote control and would would a device like that actually help you to find it ?
18203	0	a	Yeah , it is possible , yeah
18204	0	a	, yeah .
18205	0	a	There might be something that you can do in the circuit board and the chip to make it make a noise or something , but it would take a lot more development than we have this afternoon .
18206	0	a	Okay , that is a fair evaluation .
18207	0	a	Getting lost .
18208	0	a	we so we do we have decided not to worry about that for now .
18209	0	a	Okay
18210	0	a	cause well , the designs are very bright , so you are right , they are going to stick out ,
18211	0	a	but
18212	0	a	So d do people have a preference as far as feel and functionality ? .
18213	0	a	I feel like this is simil or it is sort of what already exists
18214	0	a	so if we are trying to think of something sort of like new and fun ,
18215	0	a	even though this is like what you are init I am initially drawn to , just cause it is like comfortable and like not different .
18216	0	a	I sort of like this one ,
18217	0	a	like
18218	0	a	I I do not know why ,
18219	0	a	it just it is like small but still sort of like cute looking , I dunno .
18220	0	a	But I also like the b the side buttons on that one , like I think that is kind of neat .
18221	0	a	But I dunno how much any of this has to do with the fashionable , sort of cool looking thing
18222	0	a	that we also need to focus on .
18223	0	a	Could we maybe have like an extra button on the top for on off ?
18224	0	a	So then w we would not have to have like a dual function ?
18225	0	a	Sure .
18226	0	a	yeah , that is good , that is good .
18227	0	a	there we go .
18228	1	a	Here , stick it on .
18229	1	a	Put an extra the button on .
18230	1	a	why do not we do a product evaluation using your criteria ,
18231	0	a	if you have developed some ?
18232	0	a	Oh
18233	0	a	okay .
18234	0	a	Well
18235	0	a	do we w
18236	0	a	like
18237	0	a	I think we are supposed to have one that we do it for .
18238	0	a	Okay .
18239	0	a	That was
18240	0	a	I was a little vague on what exactly I am supposed to do ,
18241	0	a	but let me
18242	1	a	I have to like write something on the whiteboard , so .
18243	0	a	So
18244	0	a	where
18245	0	a	Right .
18246	0	a	Okay .
18247	0	a	Do you need this or just write on the white board ?
18248	0	a	Okay .
18249	0	a	No , I actually do not have like a PowerPointy thing ,
18250	0	a	cause I think it would be redundant .
18251	0	a	Okay .
18252	0	a	I dunno .
18253	0	a	It is kind of like like a joystick kind of thing ,
18254	0	a	you know ,
18255	0	a	kind of push it .
18256	0	a	Ooh .
18257	0	a	Cool .
18258	0	a	Hey .
18259	0	a	Kay .
18260	1	a	Maybe a little smaller than that .
18261	0	a	No , I kind of like it .
18262	0	a	That is hard to miss .
18263	0	a	It makes look more fruity as well .
18264	0	a	Oh it does ,
18265	0	a	it is kind of like
18266	1	a	There it could have a stem like that ,
18267	0	a	cause I do l kind of like the stem .
18268	0	a	It is like a deformed foot ,
18269	0	a	I dunno .
18270	0	a	Yeah .
18271	0	a	Like
18272	0	a	Yeah .
18273	0	a	Yeah .
18274	0	a	It almost helps you ge keep a grip too , cause it goes in between fingers .
18275	0	a	Yeah .
18276	0	a	Interesting .
18277	0	a	I like this one .
18278	0	a	Okay ,
18279	0	a	is that where people are leaning then , the potato ?
18280	0	a	I like the idea of the
18281	0	a	I mean
18282	0	a	that is really gotten the simplicity of the buttons down , that one .
18283	0	a	Variety of colours are nice .
18284	0	a	I think I am leaning towards the potato .
18285	0	a	I am worried about like using a menu .
18286	0	a	in that
18287	0	a	like
18288	0	a	i
18289	0	a	withing menus there are submenus ,
18290	0	a	and so how do you get back to the main menu ?
18291	0	a	But that has a menu button separate from a select button , whereas if this one is both the menu and the select button ?
18292	0	a	Okay .
18293	0	a	Yeah .
18294	0	a	Well
18295	0	a	that
18296	0	a	on the iPod , for example , you just every time you want to go back you hit the menu button again
18297	0	a	and it brings you back one level .
18298	0	a	Yeah .
18299	0	a	Good point .
18300	0	a	This is , it is
18301	0	a	the up and down buttons are used for scrolling up and down for a list of choices .
18302	0	a	You find the choice that you want and you press you press the right button .
18303	0	a	Could these be used for going to submenus
18304	0	a	or
18305	0	a	Okay .
18306	0	a	Yeah .
18307	0	a	Yeah , so they are used for going into and out of your submenus , yeah .
18308	0	a	Maybe
18309	0	a	yeah ,
18310	1	a	maybe it can be one of those , if you press down and hold for two seconds , then it brings you back one level or something .
18311	0	a	Okay .
18312	0	a	Well ,
18313	1	a	as long as we have that in mind as we are designing it still ,
18314	0	a	kay .
18315	0	a	Okay , so
18316	0	a	which one are we sort of roughly looking at to address whether or not it meets our s necessities , the yellowy one is that
18317	0	a	Okay ,
18318	0	a	well
18319	0	a	we can obviously change it after we go through each different one .
18320	0	a	The potato ?
18321	0	a	Are we leaning towards the potato ?
18322	0	a	Okay .
18323	0	a	Potato .
18324	0	a	I think so .
18325	0	a	So
18326	0	a	basically what we need to do is
18327	1	a	some of the things that we have talked about before we need to make sure that that remote actually does conform to the things that we said it was going to .
18328	0	a	Okay .
18329	0	a	So
18330	1	a	what we sort of want to do is that we each need to separately rank each of the following things
18331	1	a	and then I will tabulate an average
18332	0	a	just to make sure that it does meet that .
18333	0	a	Okay .
18334	0	a	So
18335	1	a	we will just go through them one at a time and we will just go around and each of you can tell me on a scale of one to seven
18336	0	a	with one being really extremely true and seven being not true at all , or false ,
18337	0	a	if the remote that we have created conforms to the following criteria .
18338	0	a	So
18339	1	a	we can do this one first .
18340	0	a	First we want to know if it meets the fancy look and feel objective .
18341	0	a	So like
18342	0	a	in my opinion the for now at least , the yellow one is probably somewhere in the middle
18343	0	a	so I am going to say it is like a three .
18344	0	a	That is just my opinion .
18345	0	a	Yeah .
18346	0	a	What does each of you
18347	0	a	Okay ,
18348	0	a	well
18349	1	a	give it a number ,
18350	0	a	sorry .
18351	0	a	I I kind of think it is it is unique enough that I would give it a one or a two .
18352	0	a	Okay .
18353	0	a	I will give it a one .
18354	0	a	I dunno if it is
18355	0	a	it is creative .
18356	0	a	I dunno if fancy is the word I would use .
18357	0	a	I dunno if any of them are fancy
18358	0	a	in
18359	0	a	I would say two , because c unique .
18360	0	a	Okay .
18361	0	a	And two ,
18362	0	a	awesome .
18363	0	a	I will go for two .
18364	0	a	Alright ,
18365	0	a	and same sort of scale for functionality , is it functional ?
18366	0	a	I think it is extremely functional , I am going to give it a one .
18367	0	a	Yeah , one .
18368	0	a	One ?
18369	0	a	Okay .
18370	0	a	I think it is it is functional , it is also pretty basic , so I will give it a two .
18371	0	a	functional .
18372	0	a	I think it will get everything done , I think it might be a little confusing at first ,
18373	0	a	, I do not know if that is going to be a later one .
18374	0	a	Okay .
18375	0	a	Well
18376	0	a	there is some other ones ,
18377	1	a	I will address that ,
18378	0	a	yeah .
18379	0	a	Okay ,
18380	0	a	then I am going to give it a two .
18381	0	a	Awesome ,
18382	0	a	okay .
18383	0	a	we want to know next if it is technologically innovative .
18384	0	a	Did you give a functional ?
18385	0	a	Okay .
18386	0	a	Yeah , she said it was one .
18387	0	a	is it technologically innovative ?
18388	0	a	Not really , I mean not so much ,
18389	0	a	cause we we do not have the LCD screen , we do not have fancy chip .
18390	0	a	Other than what it looks like ,
18391	0	a	I dunno if it is really
18392	0	a	I
18393	0	a	kinetic battery is a big one ,
18394	0	a	so .
18395	0	a	Well ,
18396	0	a	the kinetic battery .
18397	0	a	In the battery , that is it .
18398	0	a	How many people would notice that , though ?
18399	0	a	Yeah .
18400	0	a	But it
18401	0	a	but we know it is there .
18402	0	a	But they will notice it after like a year ,
18403	0	a	they will be like hey , I have never changed the battery .
18404	0	a	And if it is made of like latex , that whole idea , that is pretty cool .
18405	0	a	I will give it a three .
18406	0	a	Just the material .
18407	0	a	Cause it
18408	0	a	we could have picked a lot of features that would have made it really
18409	0	a	Alright .
18410	0	a	I I would say that it is
18411	0	a	Yeah ,
18412	0	a	like fancy versus creative it is it is different .
18413	0	a	But does that equal innovative ?
18414	0	a	I dunno .
18415	0	a	I will give it a three .
18416	0	a	Everyone else ?
18417	0	a	kay .
18418	0	a	I would say it is technologically it is not it is not unique ,
18419	0	a	I mean it is it is just it is just pushbuttons ,
18420	0	a	so I I would give it a four .
18421	0	a	Think I am going to go with the four as well .
18422	0	a	I really like that kinetic battery though .
18423	0	a	Next , is it easy to use ?
18424	0	a	Just so you know , easy to learn will be separate ,
18425	1	a	so do not overlap them .
18426	0	a	kay .
18427	0	a	Okay .
18428	0	a	I think it is really easy to use .
18429	0	a	I will give it a two .
18430	0	a	I will give it a one .
18431	0	a	Pretty hard to mess up .
18432	0	a	I will say one .
18433	0	a	let is say two .
18434	0	a	Alright .
18435	0	a	we next want to see if it has a spongy quality
18436	0	a	and if indeed it is made of latex or rubber
18437	0	a	I
18438	0	a	it is spongy all the way .
18439	0	a	Give it a one .
18440	0	a	Yeah .
18441	0	a	Yeah .
18442	0	a	I wonder if it bounces when you drop it .
18443	0	a	Ooh ,
18444	0	a	that you could not
18445	0	a	it would be harder to break , harder to lose .
18446	0	a	Yeah .
18447	0	a	Cause there would be less impact maybe , .
18448	0	a	Iain , what do you give it ?
18449	0	a	Alright
18450	0	a	and the next is , does it integrate some notion of fruits and vegetables ?
18451	0	a	Well ,
18452	0	a	is it going to be yellow ?
18453	0	a	Yeah ,
18454	1	a	but if you had like a silvery kind of white or something .
18455	0	a	Yeah
18456	0	a	I would I would give it a one .
18457	0	a	It it might be ,
18458	0	a	cause that is our corporate colour ,
18459	0	a	is not it ?
18460	0	a	We might want to keep it yellow .
18461	0	a	That is right , yeah ,
18462	0	a	corporate colour , we did not keep that in
18463	0	a	well
18464	0	a	if we
18465	0	a	I know it would make it a little less c a little more confusing ,
18466	1	a	but if we had all the buttons in black , and a design in and the outside in yellow , that would be our corporate one and we could also have alternative colours , one a more conservative one , one that is more fruity .
18467	0	a	Yeah .
18468	0	a	Yeah .
18469	0	a	Yeah ,
18470	0	a	Yeah .
18471	1	a	and can we have like an RR inscribed on the bottom or something ?
18472	0	a	Okay .
18473	0	a	If we had a yellow
18474	0	a	Sure .
18475	0	a	Oh ,
18476	0	a	yeah .
18477	0	a	Alright , so
18478	0	a	I think it it is
18479	0	a	Yeah .
18480	0	a	Fruity , so fruity .
18481	0	a	So
18482	0	a	it was inspired by the potato ,
18483	0	a	so I think it is pretty fruity .
18484	0	a	I think i it is kind of mangoey too .
18485	0	a	Oh , mango
18486	0	a	that that
18487	0	a	That is a much more trendy than a potato one .
18488	0	a	Yeah .
18489	0	a	Mangoey is better , yeah .
18490	0	a	I
18491	0	a	okay ,
18492	0	a	I am giving it a one
18493	0	a	the mango put me over .
18494	0	a	Yes .
18495	0	a	I like mangoes .
18496	0	a	What are what is everyone is numbers ?
18497	0	a	Alright
18498	0	a	, and does the design match the appropriate behaviour ?
18499	0	a	Remember earlier we discussed that people do not use a lot of buttons , that they use the channel flipping and the volume the most .
18500	0	a	two .
18501	0	a	One .
18502	0	a	I think we really took that into account a lot , so I am going to give it a one .
18503	0	a	Yeah , me too .
18504	0	a	one .
18505	0	a	Did you say one , Rose ?
18506	0	a	Okay ,
18507	0	a	also we talked earlier about RSI and wanting to prevent any sort of like Carpal Tunnely kind of thing .
18508	0	a	Yes .
18509	0	a	Do we think that the latex sort of grip appropriately takes that into account ?
18510	0	a	I think I will give it a two ,
18511	0	a	cause I almost feel like no matter what you do , something is going to happen .
18512	0	a	It is going to be hard .
18513	0	a	Yeah .
18514	0	a	Yeah ,
18515	0	a	yeah .
18516	0	a	And if it is repetitive movement it is going to be only four buttons that you are constantly pushing ,
18517	0	a	but
18518	0	a	I like how it fits in the hand though
18519	0	a	so I I would go with a two .
18520	0	a	worth the risk , I think .
18521	0	a	Yeah .
18522	0	a	I will I will say two as well .
18523	0	a	Because older people that are not used to like texting with the thumb might find it a bit at first ,
18524	0	a	but
18525	0	a	The menu system and the the fact that multiple buttons are used for different things might be a bit confusing ,
18526	0	a	but I think if it is one it is one of those things that it might take you five minutes to figure out , but you will have it afterwards .
18527	0	a	Kay .
18528	0	a	Yeah
18529	0	a	I will I will say two .
18530	0	a	Alright ,
18531	0	a	awesome .
18532	0	a	And the ease of learning it .
18533	0	a	I know you were saying that you are a little bit nervous about that ,
18534	0	a	I dunno .
18535	0	a	It sort of reminds me of the iPod .
18536	0	a	I just got mine , I still have not read the instruction book and I am doing okay , so
18537	0	a	and I am not good at learning technology .
18538	0	a	So I will give it a two .
18539	0	a	So I would I think I would give it a two I guess .
18540	0	a	I think it it is probably a little harder then most remotes to learn ,
18541	0	a	because you have to you have to use the menu system
18542	0	a	and you have to tell it what your favourite channels are and that could take a bit of learning at first ,
18543	0	a	but once you have , yeah once you would learned how to use it , I think it is a lot easier .
18544	0	a	Oh ,
18545	0	a	good point .
18546	0	a	So I would I would give it a four .
18547	0	a	Okay .
18548	0	a	I think I would give it a four too .
18549	0	a	It is a pretty high learning curve , it will be easy once you have done it ,
18550	0	a	but We we
18551	0	a	I think we can kind of say we addressed it with colour ,
18552	0	a	but
18553	0	a	Yeah .
18554	0	a	Alright ,
18555	0	a	also earlier we had something about losing it and so now we are not addressing that at all ,
18556	0	a	so
18557	0	a	Okay , so
18558	0	a	in terms of not losing it , do you think that on a scale of one to seven , how easy or hard is it to lose ?
18559	0	a	I am going to I am going to give it a four ,
18560	0	a	cause I think that you can still
18561	0	a	if it is in between somewhere where you ca not see it , you are kind of not going to find it , but anywhere else it is going to stand out .
18562	0	a	Yeah .
18563	0	a	I would say I would give it a three ,
18564	0	a	I guess it depends on how tidy you are normally .
18565	0	a	I would give it a four .
18566	0	a	I will give it a five cause i it would be easy to lose something like that , yeah .
18567	0	a	Small too .
18568	0	a	Alright ,
18569	0	a	we also said simplicity ,
18570	0	a	how w how well does it address just being simple ?
18571	0	a	I think overall , cause we had said before our two main things were simplicity and fashion ,
18572	1	a	so those are the next two things we are going to look at .
18573	0	a	Simple to use or simple in design ?
18574	0	a	Do you know ?
18575	0	a	Right .
18576	0	a	Separate from fancy , like that sort of thing .
18577	0	a	it like wants to be simple but it is not like totally totally simple , so I am going to give it a two .
18578	0	a	I am give it a three I guess .
18579	0	a	I will give it a two .
18580	0	a	Three .
18581	0	a	Alright ,
18582	0	a	and fashionable ?
18583	0	a	It is hot ,
18584	0	a	I mean it is a mango , come on .
18585	0	a	It is totally fashionable .
18586	0	a	I would give it a one .
18587	0	a	Mango .
18588	0	a	I mean how fashionable can you make a remote ?
18589	0	a	I think it is bringing technology and fashion together real really well .
18590	0	a	I dunno .
18591	0	a	I do not think it is quite as fashionable as my robot remote or alien or whatever he was .
18592	0	a	I do like the little Martian one .
18593	0	a	Yeah ,
18594	0	a	the toggle on off switch , it is really appealing .
18595	0	a	Number .
18596	0	a	two .
18597	0	a	Three .
18598	0	a	One .
18599	0	a	And does it meet our like demographic need sort of for international appeal , that whole thing ?
18600	0	a	Just that it would se serve our audience .
18601	0	a	I do not see why not .
18602	0	a	I think as long
18603	1	a	if we offer in a in at least three different colour arrangements .
18604	0	a	yeah , that is good .
18605	0	a	Yeah .
18606	0	a	So I will give it a a two .
18607	0	a	Yeah , I will say two .
18608	0	a	Alright ,
18609	1	a	did anyone have any other features that they think were important that we did not talk about ?
18610	0	a	And so we are going to do that ,
18611	0	a	so it will address it ,
18612	0	a	fine .
18613	0	a	Well
18614	0	a	we did not we did not address the fact that it does need to b have a corporate logo ,
18615	1	a	so let is let is make sure we keep that in mind that we ha that one of our colours concepts is corporate and has an RR on it .
18616	0	a	Shall we
18617	0	a	Well
18618	1	a	I think all of them should have an RR .
18619	1	a	All of them should have RR ,
18620	0	a	yeah .
18621	0	a	kay .
18622	0	a	Okay .
18623	0	a	That is me .
18624	0	a	Lovely .
18625	0	a	Okay ,
18626	1	a	now we are going to look at finances .
18627	0	a	I have an Excel sheet that we are actually going to calculate the cost ,
18628	1	a	so let me exit out of this first .
18629	0	a	Okay
18630	0	a	I know .
18631	0	a	Whoa .
18632	0	a	Oh my .
18633	0	a	Let me one more space .
18634	1	a	Gonna zoom in real quick .
18635	0	a	Okay .
18636	1	a	Hand dynamo .
18637	0	a	We are using kinetic battery ,
18638	0	a	right ?
18639	0	a	and we are having one per
18640	0	a	One , okay .
18641	0	a	we are n using kinetic , yeah .
18642	0	a	Yeah .
18643	1	a	electronics .
18644	0	a	Single .
18645	0	a	Simple , simple rather .
18646	0	a	Simple .
18647	0	a	Simple .
18648	0	a	kay .
18649	1	a	the case .
18650	0	a	double curved .
18651	0	a	Guess it is double curved .
18652	0	a	It is pretty curvy .
18653	0	a	Yeah .
18654	0	a	It is very curvy , so okay .
18655	0	a	Yeah
18656	0	a	I never did get a picture of those
18657	0	a	so I do not really know .
18658	1	a	Our case material supplements
18659	0	a	oops ,
18660	0	a	we just skipped by them .
18661	0	a	Well
18662	0	a	do not we need plastic , and
18663	0	a	Provided , okay .
18664	0	a	No , we we the plastic is the plastic for the inside is assumed .
18665	0	a	The supplement is
18666	0	a	Oh ,
18667	0	a	I guess it was rubber rather than latex .
18668	0	a	The wood ?
18669	0	a	I mean the rubber .
18670	0	a	It was rubber and special colour ,
18671	0	a	right ?
18672	0	a	Do we have more than one special colour ?
18673	0	a	Per
18674	0	a	Well ,
18675	0	a	but we know that we are having at least three colours ,
18676	0	a	so
18677	0	a	Right .
18678	0	a	Yeah .
18679	0	a	, okay .
18680	0	a	Yeah , we are using we are going to need at least two special colours .
18681	0	a	well
18682	0	a	I do not know what the se the basic colour is though .
18683	0	a	Special colours ,
18684	0	a	is not it ?
18685	0	a	We have got five .
18686	0	a	I dunno where it
18687	0	a	yeah .
18688	1	a	So let is y say three .
18689	0	a	Well ,
18690	0	a	are we talking about on each colour combination
18691	0	a	or are we ,
18692	0	a	you know ,
18693	0	a	we will
18694	0	a	like we will have yellow and black .
18695	0	a	Is that two special colours ?
18696	0	a	Or or is white and black , then two more or
18697	0	a	Yeah ,
18698	0	a	I dunno .
18699	0	a	That I thi
18700	0	a	I thought that would be under yours .
18701	0	a	I guess it is three ,
18702	0	a	three three .
18703	0	a	We will just say three .
18704	0	a	Alright .
18705	0	a	Maybe the RR will be in colour as well ,
18706	0	a	so yeah .
18707	1	a	Interface ,
18708	0	a	we are doing push buttons .
18709	0	a	Yeah .
18710	0	a	And how many buttons do we have ?
18711	0	a	Six .
18712	0	a	We have six .
18713	0	a	Oh
18714	0	a	no , five .
18715	0	a	Six , with the power .
18716	0	a	Oh
18717	0	a	six .
18718	0	a	Yeah .
18719	0	a	Anything else ?
18720	0	a	Oh ,
18721	0	a	buttons
18722	0	a	oh , so .
18723	0	a	No .
18724	0	a	Oh ,
18725	0	a	we will do we wa
18726	0	a	Are the buttons in special colour ,
18727	0	a	special f
18728	0	a	I did not get information on
18729	0	a	Well ,
18730	0	a	does it
18731	0	a	but if we are making multiple varieties of this is where I am getting confused .
18732	0	a	Oh
18733	1	a	wait .
18734	0	a	So
18735	0	a	the case material will just have one colour ,
18736	0	a	right ,
18737	0	a	but then the buttons will be in special colours ?
18738	0	a	We are saying per unit .
18739	0	a	Yeah .
18740	0	a	per unit , okay , okay .
18741	0	a	Yeah , per unit .
18742	0	a	Okay ,
18743	0	a	so each unit will only have one colour on their
18744	0	a	but the case is could have up to thr
18745	0	a	I mean the buttons could ea could be up to three colours ,
18746	0	a	cause that how it is designed there .
18747	0	a	Alright ,
18748	0	a	and each button s
18749	0	a	Yeah , okay .
18750	0	a	Yeah .
18751	0	a	Yeah .
18752	0	a	I like it like that .
18753	0	a	So
18754	0	a	Special form ?
18755	0	a	They are all kind of just push button ,
18756	0	a	right ?
18757	0	a	Special material ?
18758	0	a	No ,
18759	0	a	I think they are fine .
18760	0	a	Yeah .
18761	0	a	Material , we want them rubber as well probably ,
18762	0	a	yeah .
18763	0	a	Oh
18764	0	a	do
18765	0	a	I have to do it per button ,
18766	0	a	do I ?
18767	0	a	Okay .
18768	0	a	No , I do not think so .
18769	0	a	I think they are
18770	0	a	if they are all going to be rubber then it that is what it matters .
18771	0	a	Yeah ,
18772	0	a	cause it would not make sense otherwise , cause for the whole mat case material it is only one .
18773	0	a	Yeah .
18774	0	a	Yeah .
18775	0	a	Yeah .
18776	0	a	It is
18777	0	a	I mean it is two to make it rubber .
18778	0	a	Okay .
18779	1	a	Oh wait ,
18780	0	a	so maybe .
18781	0	a	Thirteen point seven .
18782	0	a	Oh oh .
18783	0	a	Yeah ,
18784	1	a	what can we reduce ?
18785	0	a	Let is see what that would do .
18786	0	a	Okay ,
18787	1	a	let is have our buttons all be one colour .
18788	0	a	, I kind of like the buttons .
18789	0	a	It is only going to bring us down to thirteen point three anyway .
18790	0	a	Alright .
18791	0	a	Okay ,
18792	0	a	are we sure this is double curved ?
18793	0	a	Maybe it is single curved ,
18794	0	a	we have no idea .
18795	0	a	We have no idea .
18796	0	a	I dunno , I did not get any pictures .
18797	0	a	It is single curved .
18798	0	a	It is single curved .
18799	0	a	Why not ?
18800	0	a	Yeah .
18801	0	a	Well
18802	0	a	it is not the
18803	0	a	yeah .
18804	0	a	Okay ,
18805	0	a	it is the kinetic battery that is kind of expensive ,
18806	0	a	but we have a simple chip , single curve , case material is rubber and it is a special colour ,
18807	0	a	but that is important .
18808	0	a	That is important .
18809	0	a	Six buttons we have to have six buttons .
18810	0	a	How did it get more expensive , what did you just change ?
18811	0	a	It was it was thirteen and now it is fifteen .
18812	0	a	What ?
18813	0	a	No , okay ,
18814	0	a	maybe not .
18815	0	a	I do not know what just happened .
18816	0	a	Now it is twelve .
18817	0	a	We
18818	0	a	Yeah , they are .
18819	0	a	What was our target price again ?
18820	0	a	Twelve point five .
18821	0	a	Twelve point five .
18822	0	a	Twelve point five .
18823	0	a	Hey hey .
18824	0	a	So we are just just about there .
18825	0	a	So we are okay , I think .
18826	0	a	We are all set then .
18827	0	a	Yeah .
18828	0	a	Ish .
18829	0	a	Okay , we are all set .
18830	0	a	Alright .
18831	0	a	save .
18832	0	a	I saved that to our our big shared folder , so you know .
18833	0	a	okay ,
18834	1	a	back to agenda .
18835	0	a	are the are the costs under twelve fifty Euro ?
18836	0	a	Yes .
18837	0	a	Yes .
18838	0	a	Yeah .
18839	1	a	Let is move on to the project evaluation .
18840	0	a	Project process .
18841	0	a	Satisfaction with for example the room for creativity , leadership , teamwork , the means , any new ideas found .
18842	0	a	So I guess what we are going to talk about here is just evaluating how we created this project
18843	0	a	, the information we got on the news , how we used it , if we were able to , you know , use our creativity with the information ,
18844	0	a	how how well I guess I led it , the how well we worked together as a team , the digital pens , the whiteboard .
18845	0	a	Well .
18846	1	a	Okay .
18847	0	a	I felt very creative .
18848	0	a	I enjoyed making the prototypes .
18849	0	a	I think we have been successful
18850	0	a	in that we have achieved almost all of the design goals that we have set and we have come up with a finished project and we just about got cost .
18851	0	a	Yeah .
18852	0	a	I think we could have done even better with a little bit more information ,
18853	0	a	like what is a single curved case ,
18854	0	a	how many colours , what do colours count
18855	0	a	things ,
18856	0	a	but given given what we had I think that we did we did really well .
18857	0	a	I think we worked together pretty well .
18858	0	a	Yeah .
18859	0	a	Yeah , I mean
18860	0	a	if I would had more market research on the fruits and vegetables , maybe we could have taken that into account .
18861	0	a	Yeah .
18862	0	a	But the fruits and vegetables , they really my creativity , so .
18863	0	a	I know , I really did , the the whole mango idea was great .
18864	0	a	No ,
18865	0	a	I mean
18866	0	a	I thought the pen was a little distracting for me personally ,
18867	0	a	like its heaviness , and like just being so conscious of like turning the pages , I dunno .
18868	0	a	Do you think we could
18869	0	a	Yeah .
18870	0	a	That was a bit of a distraction .
18871	0	a	That was the last one , like I chose not to do a PowerPoint cause
18872	0	a	I did not think it made sense to ,
18873	0	a	so I liked that I had the option to do that and just to take my own notes and that whole sort of thing .
18874	0	a	Yeah .
18875	0	a	I think we all made very significant contributions , I do not think anybody dominated it , which I thought was really good ,
18876	0	a	like each of us was able to like each of you had your information
18877	0	a	and I I tried to facilitate it without like taking over ,
18878	0	a	I like our little finished products .
18879	0	a	Yeah .
18880	0	a	They are funny .
18881	0	a	Really cute .
18882	0	a	I kind of want one .
18883	0	a	Can we market this as the mango remote ?
18884	0	a	Should we have that somewhere on the packaging ?
18885	0	a	I have a little RR .
18886	1	a	I am trying to think of a good pun that I could add there .
18887	0	a	I know ,
18888	1	a	let is think of it like a little jingle .
18889	0	a	I like the RR ,
18890	1	a	that is going to be etched in .
18891	0	a	Yes .
18892	0	a	Hopefully not with just my fingernail at some point
18893	0	a	but it is quite a useful little gadget .
18894	0	a	All thanks to Iain for the design of that one .
18895	0	a	Okay
18896	0	a	new ideas found ?
18897	0	a	Definitely .
18898	0	a	What did we find for new ideas ?
18899	0	a	People should really base their remotes on fruits and vegetables .
18900	0	a	Yeah .
18901	0	a	Or or at least be c p creative enough to think of toggle switches etcetera .
18902	0	a	I I am really into the idea of kinetic batteries now after reading about them .
18903	0	a	Oh ,
18904	0	a	I am so excited .
18905	0	a	Yeah ,
18906	0	a	I did not even know they existed .
18907	0	a	That was
18908	0	a	I
18909	0	a	I knew you can get watches that had them , like really quite expensive watches that just never need a battery , cause you are always moving your wrist .
18910	0	a	But in other things , I think it would be really good .
18911	0	a	I thi
18912	0	a	yeah , that is awesome .
18913	0	a	okay ,
18914	1	a	closing .
18915	0	a	Are the costs within the budget ?
18916	0	a	Is the project evaluated ?
18917	0	a	Now
18918	0	a	there is the final questionnaire and meeting summary .
18919	0	a	Yes .
18920	0	a	so ,
18921	0	a	this is the great product kids , I think we have created something really interesting
18922	0	a	and that we have a market for it , especially if we can produce it at twelve point three
18923	0	a	which we hope
18924	0	a	yeah .
18925	0	a	Yeah .
18926	1	a	Make sure in your questionnaire to put down criticisms of both the process and the the final results
18927	0	a	and .
18928	0	a	Yeah ,
18929	0	a	Real Reaction .
18930	0	a	I do like the Martian remote .
18931	0	a	If we could choose more than one , that would be my second choice .
18932	0	a	Oh ,
18933	0	a	that would definitely be my second choice .
18934	0	a	Although the tog toggle I am afraid I would
18935	0	a	It is cool .
18936	0	a	That is cool .
18937	0	a	Let is all let is all go for the yellow
18938	0	a	Break the stem off .
18939	0	a	I would break it .
18940	0	a	I would break it .
18941	0	a	I think I would break it .
18942	0	a	It started because I wanted to have it as st as a stem
18943	0	a	and then
18944	0	a	alright , so
18945	0	a	Is it started as a pear , but then it started looking more and more like a Martian
18946	0	a	when I put the
18947	0	a	Take me to your leader .
18948	0	a	Oh
18949	0	a	that is funny .
18950	0	a	Kind of looks like a penguin , like with no eye .
18951	0	a	Oh
18952	0	a	yeah , it is kind of a penguin .
18953	0	a	I like that it stands up .
18954	0	a	Mm mm .
18955	0	a	Wow ,
18956	0	a	maybe I should market it to some remote control company now .
18957	0	a	So are are
18958	0	a	poor little thing .
18959	0	a	That was bound to happen
18960	0	a	Oh , sad .
18961	0	a	kay ,
18962	0	a	congratulations .
18963	1	a	Anything else to say ?
18964	0	a	Alright .
18965	0	a	Nothing will come up until after our meeting is supposed to be over , its all timed .
18966	0	a	Oh .
18967	0	a	anybody have
18968	0	a	I got more master classes ,
18969	0	a	anybody else want to like take a master is class ?
18970	0	a	Yeah ,
18971	1	a	but check it out .
18972	0	a	Oh .
18973	0	a	It is really funny that you got spam in your work emails .
18974	0	a	So like
18975	0	a	there are all these like links , they do not go anywhere .
18976	0	a	But all that you need to keep in mind your knowledge management .
18977	0	a	just want to make sure you do .
18978	0	a	No the first one that you sent like I did not realise that it was a joke
18979	0	a	and I was like why did she send this to us ?
18980	0	a	It is very it is very work relevant ,
18981	0	a	cause people send spam a lot .
18982	0	a	Oh
18983	0	a	It is .
18984	0	a	Yes definitely I am very sad that I did not get any links to the corporate website .
18985	0	a	Oh
18986	0	a	here you can you can view .
18987	0	a	Let is see ,
18988	0	a	what did I get through the corporate website ?
18989	0	a	It is just inspiration about circuit boards .
18990	0	a	You can just see what is up .
18991	0	a	Wow .
18992	0	a	Yeah
18993	0	a	it is it is really deep .
18994	1	a	Hold on .
18995	0	a	Takes a little while to get excited to load .
18996	0	a	That
18997	0	a	the Excel thing is pretty cool .
18998	0	a	Yes .
18999	0	a	Yeah , that is pretty neat .
19000	0	a	Here ,
19001	0	a	like , basically
19002	0	a	it is like inspiration ,
19003	0	a	basically
19004	0	a	I am going to give you two sentences on fashion and that kind of thing ,
19005	0	a	see .
19006	0	a	I love Excel , it is one of my favourite programs .
19007	0	a	You did not miss out that much .
19008	0	a	I see , .
19009	0	a	Yeah ,
19010	0	a	my inspiration from from last time is the in interior of a remote control being taken apart bit by bit , talking about circuit boards .
19011	0	a	Spongy .
19012	0	a	I learned a lot actually .
19013	0	a	Oh wow .
19014	0	a	I could probably take apart a remote control now if I really needed to .
19015	0	a	This one was cooler .
19016	0	a	I got a whole table and everything .
19017	0	a	Now I have all about circuits and chips and transponders
19018	0	a	and
19019	0	a	I wrote it all down , because I thought it would be relevant , like all the different parts of the inside of a remote control , but then they are like , you do not actually need this
19020	1	a	you just need to talk about the case .
19021	0	a	That is like mine it was like , would you prefer an LCD screen or a multifunction remote control ?
19022	0	a	And then it did not have like any kind of table ,
19023	0	a	like
19024	0	a	awesome , I am glad they asked that question and did not report the result .
19025	0	a	It is really interesting though .
19026	0	a	I I thought it was a little tricky having to hand around this thing .
19027	0	a	Yeah .
19028	0	a	Yeah .
19029	0	a	Yeah .
19030	0	a	We had a lot of the
19031	0	a	otherwise the technology today was kind of cool .
19032	0	a	I think .
19033	0	a	Yeah .
19034	0	a	That was really neat how I got emails
19035	0	a	and
19036	0	a	No .
19037	0	a	We did not we did not use the whiteboard that much .
19038	0	a	No .
19039	0	a	Although I do not see how we could have very l at least for me
19040	0	a	I
19041	0	a	yeah .
19042	1	a	If I would gotten pictures of the different parts of the case , the different looks of the case , I would have probably drawn them up ,
19043	0	a	but
19044	0	a	Yeah ,
19045	1	a	we could have put our brainstorming stuff up there rather than just talking about it ,
19046	0	a	but with only four people it does not really make sense .
19047	0	a	Cause we were not like voting on anything
19048	0	a	and I think usually , like whiteboards are good , you know like crossing out ideas ,
19049	0	a	or like if we had had like a brainstorming period .
19050	0	a	But I thought we were good orally .
19051	0	a	Get crazy .
19052	0	a	I think if you had a larger group
19053	0	a	Yeah .
19054	0	a	And with and with the PowerPoint that we can all look at , like you can do all those things pretty much on PowerPoint as that is not as necessary to have .
19055	0	a	Yeah .
19056	0	a	And these might have made us more willing to like take notes than to like write up them here , cause we all needed them separately , kind of on the whiteboards in this room .
19057	0	a	Because we are all going to be working in different places .
19058	0	a	Yeah .
19059	0	a	We
19060	0	a	if we were all going to stay in here all the time , then having the notes up on the whiteboard would have been alright ,
19061	0	a	but everyone needs their own , like specific notes , I guess .
19062	0	a	Now
19063	0	a	when you were creating your prototypes here , did you work together or did you like do separate projects ?
19064	0	a	we we worked together ,
19065	0	a	but we were making
19066	0	a	like
19067	0	a	we sort of made different shapes and then discussed how the how the buttons might work , and how we could like improve on the on the design .
19068	0	a	Yeah .
19069	0	a	Yeah .
19070	0	a	So
19071	0	a	it was a bit of both really , we just kind of started out by each taking a colour of clay and just fooling around with it
19072	0	a	and I came up with that rhombus shape
19073	0	a	and he came up with the sort of potatoey , mangoey shape , and then just went from there really .
19074	0	a	Cool .
19075	0	a	It was fun .
19076	0	a	So
19077	0	a	well done with the management , I felt well managed .
19078	0	a	Oh thanks .
19079	0	a	I think we did well in first of all giving our meetings the time , and second we actually
19080	0	a	we
19081	0	a	we did a good job of making firm decisions at the ends of the meetings .
19082	0	a	It is kind of fun .
19083	0	a	Sorry .
19084	0	a	And I
19085	0	a	I know what happens sometimes is that you tend to sort of have meetings and then people sorta drift away without anything actually really being decided .
19086	0	a	That happened to me all the time though .
19087	0	a	But I think here we got we got clear and and decisive decisive points at the end of the meetings , so that we we knew where to go on from there .
19088	0	a	Yeah ,
19089	0	a	I was quite worried at the end of the last meeting that we were not getting we did not really have enough information to make firm decisions , but we were able to do it regardless ,
19090	0	a	so .
19091	0	a	I am not usually a very decisive person ,
19092	0	a	so it helped to have people say this needs to be done in five minutes .
19093	0	a	This is what we will do .
19094	0	a	Yeah .
19095	0	a	I found that we did we could have used another five or ten minutes sometimes in the meetings .
19096	0	a	Yeah , for some of the meetings , yeah .
19097	0	a	Especially last time ,
19098	0	a	yeah .
19099	0	a	Yeah
19100	0	a	I think the last time we had a lot of information , but at the same time not quite enough ,
19101	0	a	you know what I mean ,
19102	0	a	like we we could not answer every single question .
19103	0	a	Yeah ,
19104	0	a	Yeah .
19105	0	a	Yeah .
19106	0	a	Yeah .
19107	0	a	Right .
19108	0	a	but
19109	0	a	And I I felt the first two meetings , that I was coming in with no information ,
19110	0	a	and not sort of
19111	0	a	made me really like , ooh I do not know , throwing together PowerPoint out of no no information and then last time it was like the opposite .
19112	0	a	I had so much information and so much to talk about .
19113	0	a	It was interesting what came out like later , like as I was doing the when I was doing the breakdown on the agenda that they gave me , that more points came out from your presentation even .
19114	0	a	Yeah .
19115	0	a	I am a little I am a little disappointed that we did not do a something for losing the remote , because that was kind of a big point .
19116	0	a	Yeah .
19117	0	a	that was something
19118	0	a	like
19119	0	a	in order to talk about that we would have had to have actual knowledge about circuit boards and things like
19120	0	a	Yeah .
19121	0	a	About
19122	0	a	yeah .
19123	0	a	Well
19124	0	a	the problem was , even when we just were creating from the Excel file , there was not like a option to select to somehow have it included ,
19125	0	a	so there was no
19126	0	a	we could be like
19127	0	a	yeah , it has it included .
19128	0	a	Yeah .
19129	0	a	I think we were
19130	0	a	Yeah .
19131	0	a	There was no way for us to have written down that it was really there .
19132	0	a	Considered the re
19133	0	a	yeah .
19134	0	a	I think we were just getting overenthusiastic with the task .
19135	0	a	Well
19136	0	a	it is interesting that they
19137	0	a	, yeah .
19138	0	a	I think we really got into it , I mean I got into it as the day went on
19139	0	a	and I got really like ,
19140	0	a	ooh I am designing a remote control ,
19141	0	a	I dunno if that is just me ,
19142	0	a	but
19143	0	a	Yeah .
19144	0	a	It was interesting though that they put that fifty percent of people say they have frustration with losing their remote and yet they did not provide us with information to we were not provided with information to discuss that .
19145	0	a	Yeah .
19146	0	a	I know that like people people have like things they can put on their keys that you press it and it will beep , but I but I am sure that would require some kind of technology
19147	0	a	that
19148	0	a	I just do not know what it is ,
19149	0	a	but
19150	0	a	Yeah .
19151	0	a	Yeah .
19152	0	a	I think there are some of those like infomercial remotes that have things so you wo not lose them .
19153	0	a	I dunno .
19154	0	a	I mean
19155	0	a	we were talking about it and like i in my household at least , there is only about two places that the remote is ever cause there is only one TV and there is only like three chairs .
19156	0	a	That is like saying you are never going to lose your keys , and I always do , anyway .
19157	0	a	You will lose them in your pocket ,
19158	0	a	like
19159	0	a	you just will forget that or you like put it down somewhere that like made sense and then not remember , there is always ways to lose things .
19160	0	a	Yeah .
19161	0	a	It d
19162	0	a	yeah ,
19163	0	a	it depends on how organised you are personally ,
19164	0	a	but
19165	0	a	Yeah ,
19166	0	a	or like I guess what the setup of the house is too .
19167	0	a	But , I mean I am notorious for losing my keys ,
19168	0	a	I just
19169	0	a	I guess I have just never lost the remote .
19170	0	a	I put my keys in the refrigerator the other night and could not find them .
19171	0	a	Cause I was putting groceries away .
19172	0	a	That is funny .
19173	0	a	Oh .
19174	0	a	You you are taking stuff from a bag and putting them in the refrigerator and then go back to my room .
19175	0	a	Ca not get in .
19176	0	a	Ca not get in ,
19177	0	a	look all around the kitchen .
19178	0	a	Definitely in the vegetable drawer .
19179	0	a	That is funny .
19180	0	a	So .
19181	0	a	I always do that , leaving it in my coat , and then like using a different coat .
19182	0	a	Yep .
19183	0	a	But I guess it is cause we do not carry remotes around that much .
19184	0	a	Yeah .
19185	0	a	Ca not really take it into the other room .
19186	0	a	Yeah .
19187	1	a	Maybe with our little robot one we could have had him have a robot , alien , pear , whatever he is , have a little voice like , I am located
19188	0	a	Oh
19189	1	a	a GPS system , internal GPS .
19190	0	a	Oh man .
19191	0	a	Here you go .
19192	0	a	Although if it is sitting still for too long .
19193	0	a	We should make one that walks by itself .
19194	0	a	Yes I Or little
19195	0	a	Or just just a wheel , you know .
19196	0	a	That really could get up and walk away .
19197	0	a	Or or like some crazy like electro magnet , that you push it and it will go zoom to the TV and stick there .
19198	0	a	Just if you
19199	0	a	like
19200	0	a	you would have a remote for your remote ,
19201	0	a	that will .
19202	0	a	Well ,
19203	0	a	but if you could attach them to the TV , then you can .
19204	0	a	zoom
19205	0	a	Yeah .
19206	0	a	All kinds of possibilities .
19207	0	a	Okay .
19208	0	a	Sorry ,
19209	0	a	I am just trying to update my minutes .
19210	0	a	I decided to
19211	0	a	you know how I sent you the email saying that PowerPoint minutes will be complimentary , rather than like repeating them .
19212	0	a	Yeah .
19213	1	a	Just going to make I am making full minutes , so that it will include all of the agenda and all that .
19214	0	a	Oh .
19215	0	a	Wow .
19216	0	a	Cause that seems a little more useful .
19217	0	a	Cause you have had like the most typing and organising to do .
19218	0	a	But I did not have like information to sloth through either ,
19219	0	a	so Most of it , .
19220	0	a	Yeah , I guess
19221	0	a	How much of your PowerPoint was already done for you , every meeting .
19222	0	a	I added slides , I added a couple slides each time , but that was about it .
19223	0	a	Oh .
19224	0	a	Okay .
19225	0	a	Yeah ,
19226	0	a	I did not even think about adding slides , cause I would just get slides with titles on them and fill them all
19227	0	a	in w
19228	0	a	did not even think about adding more .
19229	0	a	Well ,
19230	0	a	the thing was they would provide y an agenda with s like several points , but it would not have a slide for each point .
19231	0	a	yeah. .
19232	0	a	And that is the only way I remember that I need to go other that point .
19233	0	a	I know personally when I do PowerPoint , that is what I do
19234	0	a	and so I had it once , even if it was just like the title of it , like the three presentations , and I would do your three .
19235	0	a	Right .
19236	0	a	You have you have to have the slogan on it or can it just be like
19237	0	a	Okay
19238	0	a	good .
19239	0	a	The slogan on it ?
19240	0	a	No no no .
19241	0	a	No , no , definitely not .
19242	0	a	We
19243	0	a	No , I do not think we need to
19244	0	a	I think the R and R , especially if the yellow and black one .
19245	1	a	Cause I was like , it could go around the outside .
19246	0	a	I think we just need the the RR ,
19247	0	a	yeah .
19248	0	a	Is it yellow and blue ?
19249	0	a	Oh
19250	0	a	I guess it is black , grey .
19251	0	a	Or yellow and blue .
19252	1	a	Lemme go to the web page .
19253	0	a	Yeah ,
19254	0	a	I was just kind of going by the web page , cause they did not give me any clear , like yellow , grey , or .
19255	0	a	Grey is better than black ,
19256	0	a	does not look so bumblebeeish .
19257	0	a	I do not really like yellow in general .
19258	0	a	Hey
19259	0	a	now I understand the random like newsclippings .
19260	0	a	But it Was not it interesting that
19261	0	a	I thought it was interesting that our market marketing expert did not agree with the marketing the marketing choices ,
19262	0	a	you know , like
19263	0	a	that was a bit of a conflict .
19264	0	a	Finish meeting now .
19265	0	a	Yes .
19266	0	a	I will
19267	0	a	I just feel like if you are really doing like a a really big market evaluation , you would not just have like one set of source ,
19268	0	a	it is kind of an
19269	0	a	they were so not backed up ,
19270	0	a	it would just be a sentence like we did a survey , this is what people said .
19271	0	a	Yeah .
19272	0	a	S
19273	0	a	, I dunno .
19274	0	a	People are stupid .
19275	0	a	I guess it i it sort of a grey ,
19276	0	a	is not it ?
19277	0	a	Yellow and grey , but then the slogan is in blue .
19278	0	a	Well
19279	0	a	we got some grey and we got some blue buttons ,
19280	0	a	we are good .
19281	0	a	Yeah .
19282	0	a	Well
19283	0	a	we do not have the right colour clay anyway .
19284	0	a	Maybe , like I do not know .
19285	0	a	That could always be .
19286	0	a	Well
19287	0	a	we are not , sadly , going to actually be producing this , so .
19288	0	a	Oh .
19289	0	a	If they ever come out with potato
19290	0	a	I am going to have to
19291	0	a	Yeah .
19292	0	a	Potato mango shaped remotes .
19293	0	a	I ca not believe a whole day is gone .
19294	0	a	I do not feel like it is been that long .
19295	0	a	Get sucked in .
19296	0	a	 
19297	0	a	Are you sure I got it all head is kind of small .
19298	0	a	How are we placed in terms of the
19299	0	a	alright .
19300	0	a	Okay .
19301	0	a	We are okay ?
19302	0	a	We are good ?
19303	0	a	I guess it is going to be hard to drink coffee .
19304	1	a	Guess I should probably try to sit up straight .
19305	0	a	Like that ?
19306	0	a	Okay , cool .
19307	0	a	Oh ,
19308	0	a	I think mine is fallen off .
19309	0	a	It fell That is why .
19310	0	a	okay .
19311	0	a	Okay ?
19312	0	a	Right , so
19313	1	a	I am just going to start this PowerPoint real quick .
19314	0	a	Wow .
19315	0	a	Yeah , PowerPoint .
19316	0	a	Very official .
19317	0	a	Yeah , well ,
19318	0	a	you know , .
19319	0	a	Yeah I kind of like this I am kind of getting into it .
19320	0	a	Right .
19321	0	a	So
19322	1	a	just to kick off the meeting
19323	0	a	basically so
19324	0	a	we are working now for a real reaction ,
19325	0	a	this is so it
19326	0	a	right .
19327	1	a	Just got an agenda to set out what we are going to try to accomplish in this particular first meeting .
19328	0	a	We are going to just do a quick opening and we can hopefully all get acquainted with one another then we are going to start talk a little bit about tool training .
19329	0	a	Essentially that means getting used to the only thing that we have not tried out yet , the whiteboard .
19330	0	a	we have got a general plan for the project how we are going to go about accomplishing this and then just a bit of discussion close up .
19331	0	a	I guess you know game or something in real life
19332	0	a	so yeah basically
19333	0	a	I want to I am just going to you got
19334	0	a	of course you can discuss that ,
19335	1	a	I am thinking about proposing that since we have got this weird blend of ourselves and our roles that we just do not ask , do not tell .
19336	0	a	so
19337	1	a	if you say something about marketing , right , sorted ,
19338	0	a	y is
19339	0	a	Exactly .
19340	1	a	You are just going to believe me , we will go from there .
19341	0	a	Fair enough .
19342	0	a	I mean
19343	0	a	obvi if if you guys if if at the same time if you like logically if something does not like if I am
19344	0	a	like
19345	0	a	we are going to sell a remote control that is the size of this paper book
19346	0	a	you know
19347	1	a	you say like well that does not seem like such a good idea because of X obviously go with it .
19348	1	a	I mean we will discuss it
19349	1	a	but I am not going to ask do you know that
19350	1	a	or yeah it seems like
19351	0	a	yeah
19352	0	a	yeah
19353	0	a	exactly
19354	0	a	so ,
19355	0	a	cause we are what
19356	0	a	we are sort of role playing
19357	0	a	is y g
19358	0	a	yeah
19359	1	a	you are going to tap into your own knowledge as well .
19360	0	a	Prove it
19361	0	a	yeah ,
19362	0	a	okay .
19363	1	a	And that is the same for your when we do introductions
19364	1	a	I mean and you talk about your background
19365	0	a	you know
19366	1	a	have fun ,
19367	0	a	you know
19368	0	a	maybe you went to
19369	0	a	you know
19370	0	a	maybe i you are like in Maine
19371	0	a	you went to UCSB
19372	0	a	but you want to say you went to Harvard or something like that ,
19373	1	a	why not ,
19374	0	a	you know
19375	0	a	you can this is
19376	0	a	you know
19377	1	a	I guess we can have a little bit of fun with it .
19378	0	a	So are you guys okay with that does that seem logical ?
19379	0	a	Sweet .
19380	0	a	Oh yeah , that is fine .
19381	0	a	Sure .
19382	0	a	Works for me .
19383	0	a	Cool .
19384	0	a	So
19385	0	a	I guess that that we are totally
19386	0	a	we are making a remote control
19387	0	a	which is thrilling
19388	0	a	but the idea is that we can make something based on the whole corporate model
19389	0	a	I dunno if you guys had time to check the
19390	0	a	in real life I dunno if you guys checked the the corporate website .
19391	0	a	Right .
19392	0	a	we have got to make something as fashionable as possible , that is kind of the corporate strategy is we are going to try to take ordinary stuff that nobody really thinks about and try to make it nice
19393	0	a	you know
19394	0	a	like John Lewis nice or you know if you go to Debenham is or something .
19395	0	a	So basically
19396	0	a	we are reinventing the wheel but we want to try to do it in a user friendly slick sleek kind of way .
19397	1	a	way we are going to go about doing that is basically at first we are going to start on the basics .
19398	1	a	And that is where I am going to need you guys the User Interface Designers and the the other designer
19399	0	a	that I ca not remember ,
19400	0	a	the the ID and the UID
19401	0	a	right
19402	0	a	the Industrial Designer
19403	0	a	hey right on alright ,
19404	0	a	getting into it
19405	1	a	to guide me and guide us on this project
19406	0	a	cause you are going to be
19407	0	a	you are
19408	0	a	g
19409	0	a	you guys are the bottom
19410	0	a	you know
19411	0	a	you are like no you ca not do that you ca not have you know
19412	0	a	X and Y at the same time .
19413	0	a	There you go .
19414	1	a	And then we will work up from what is necessary to more like what would be good ,
19415	0	a	you know like
19416	0	a	I
19417	0	a	I think you guys probably got the same emails I did
19418	0	a	but the idea of , yes a coffee pot needs to be able to hold coffee
19419	0	a	but it is also better if it is not like really cheap glass
19420	0	a	so that it if you touch it you hurt your hand , or something like that .
19421	1	a	and so we will work up from there
19422	1	a	and then we will meet on and talk about it
19423	1	a	and then finally we will incorporate as kind of the last stage you know where you guys build or tell me
19424	1	a	tell us what is possible
19425	1	a	and then you tell us what we can hope for and what way to go take the the the take the basics and make it nicer
19426	1	a	and then ov obviously the UID and the ID
19427	1	a	you know you you can keep on the
19428	1	a	you know sort of at the cutting edge of how to get about maximising what is possible to try t of sync it all up .
19429	0	a	So that is the detailed design .
19430	0	a	So it is a three stage kind of thing .
19431	0	a	right so
19432	1	a	for now just for th the white board basically just to get used to it ,
19433	0	a	I have not tried it yet either
19434	1	a	I am just going to start and carry like five remotes around and just write down
19435	1	a	I am just going to write down one of the names of my desert discs
19436	0	a	you know
19437	1	a	if you if you were trapped on a desert island and you could only bring five CDs along with you name one of them that you could , not all five , if you want to write all five go for it but name one of them that you could .

19655	0	a	Of course .
19656	0	a	Oh ,
19657	0	a	now I can think of so many other ones .
19658	0	a	And so there
19659	1	a	Something I miss about my hometown .
19660	0	a	Well
19661	0	a	yeah
19662	0	a	that is why
19663	0	a	yeah .
19664	0	a	That is how it works .
19665	0	a	I miss coffee .
19666	0	a	Burritos that cost less than eight Pounds .
19667	0	a	Nice .
19668	0	a	Burritos .
19669	0	a	Oh
19670	0	a	Any thing that are like free .

19673	0	a	Where are you from in California by the way ?
19674	0	a	Did you really ?
19675	0	a	What part ?
19676	0	a	Yeah
19677	0	a	I am from San Diego as well .
19678	0	a	I grew up in San Diego ,
19679	0	a	but
19680	0	a	yeah
19681	0	a	La Jolla , PB .
19682	0	a	Nice .
19683	0	a	Yeah oh man .

19688	0	a	Going to s like North Carol
19689	0	a	I am sorry you you just ca not get a better burrito than what is available in the s in San Diego .
19690	0	a	It is different .
19691	0	a	Cause in San Diego th the tortillas are cooked on the grill and in northern California they steam them .
19692	0	a	It must make all the difference .
19693	0	a	Yeah , it really does .
19694	0	a	Well
19695	0	a	it is it is i
19696	0	a	there is other things too
19697	0	a	there is
19698	0	a	you just ca not place it
19699	0	a	like
19700	0	a	I when I went to school in the U in Santa Barbara which is central California
19701	0	a	the Mexican food is okay , it is just not good

19707	0	a	good call on that .
19708	0	a	Right .
19709	0	a	Yeah .
19710	0	a	Where you from in San Diego ?
19711	0	a	Okay .
19712	0	a	just literally just metropolitan San Diego , I live like five minutes from the zoo .
19713	0	a	So
19714	0	a	North Park actually if you want to get real specific .
19715	0	a	Yeah ,
19716	0	a	my grandparents lived on thirty second .
19717	0	a	Yep .
19718	0	a	Close t
19719	0	a	do you know where Clare de Lune coffee shop is ,

19723	0	a	Yes .
19724	0	a	On university , yeah .
19725	0	a	Yeah it is actually like literally half a mile from my house .
19726	0	a	Yeah ,
19727	0	a	pretty cool .
19728	0	a	Small world as we were discussing before .
19729	0	a	Yeah .
19730	0	a	Especially when we are all from the same general region .
19731	0	a	Right so okay ,
19732	0	a	success on the whiteboard .
19733	0	a	There you go .
19734	0	a	You can harness the awesome power a little bit introductions we talked about some of our CDs and things we like about the city
19735	0	a	you know ,
19736	0	a	I think we will
19737	0	a	right so
19738	1	a	moving on to not fun stuff project finance .
19739	0	a	Wow .
19740	0	a	basically
19741	0	a	what we are trying to do is sell this remote for twenty five Euros .
19742	0	a	This is what the finance department has told me , the CFO
19743	0	a	but I do not know , I am not sold on this
19744	0	a	, it is pretty dear ,
19745	0	a	I mean
19746	0	a	twenty f
19747	0	a	that is like you know forty bucks for a remote .
19748	0	a	It would have to pretty much like do my laundry for me .
19749	0	a	so
19750	0	a	what
19751	1	a	we can maybe work on that
19752	1	a	a later
19753	0	a	but we are going to make a lot on it , the profit aims to make fifty million Euros on it .
19754	0	a	Eur internationally .
19755	0	a	So
19756	1	a	one of the things I I was going to mention to you
19757	1	a	you guys
19758	1	a	the designers is that it m
19759	1	a	we probably need a rever it needs to be a universal remote control probably .
19760	0	a	Okay .
19761	0	a	so
19762	1	a	something that could do NTSC as well as PAL as well as various other formats like if it is going to control DVDs
19763	0	a	but you know
19764	1	a	I will leave that to you guys
19765	0	a	but that is something that i i
19766	0	a	it is going to be an international sold thing .
19767	0	a	Makes sense .
19768	0	a	but we want to try to make it for twelve fifty .
19769	0	a	So we want to try to make a hundred percent profit on it if we can .
19770	0	a	s right so
19771	1	a	just to close up ,
19772	0	a	I am not sure how much time I have used
19773	0	a	next time right Project Manager , sorted .
19774	0	a	Is
19775	0	a	we will meet in another half an hour or so and I would like the Industrial Designer to get ge think about what needs to be done , like what the basic function of it .
19776	0	a	UID well
19777	0	a	yeah
19778	0	a	you right
19779	0	a	g
19780	0	a	your assignments are up there and you will also get s assignments from in your email as well more spec specifics on what do do .
19781	0	a	basic and so
19782	0	a	I need you to tell us what we what the user is going to want .
19783	0	a	What they are looking for .
19784	0	a	So
19785	1	a	actually in a way you guys c maybe in our next meeting chat a bit about what the user is going to want and what the user can have ,
19786	0	a	you know like so
19787	0	a	yeah
19788	0	a	well it is
19789	1	a	and we will discuss the trade offs in between
19790	0	a	so yeah
19791	0	a	specific instructions will be sent in your email .
19792	1	a	And negotiate that .
19793	0	a	But I think that that is more or less a good place to start for now
19794	0	a	and as more things come up
19795	0	a	we will have meetings and you will get emails and so forth .
19796	0	a	any questions , before we get started ?
19797	0	a	You mean to like
19798	0	a	I assume that we are building a stand alone remote control ,
19799	0	a	we ca not kind of build it into other products .
19800	0	a	For instance like a mobile phone or something like that .
19801	0	a	Sounds interesting .
19802	0	a	Yeah .
19803	0	a	I do not think there is any rules about it yet .
19804	0	a	So
19805	0	a	Yeah .
19806	0	a	Maybe our personal coach will have something to say about that .
19807	0	a	Or or you know can we produ
19808	0	a	can we sell a remote control phone for twenty five pounds or less ?
19809	0	a	Yep .
19810	0	a	Well ,
19811	1	a	have a think about it .
19812	0	a	I mean
19813	0	a	I am I am certainly op
19814	0	a	it seems
19815	0	a	like yeah
19816	0	a	it it seems like it is certainly do able
19817	0	a	is not it .
19818	0	a	Okay .
19819	0	a	W
19820	0	a	yeah .
19821	0	a	I mean
19822	1	a	or if we ca not have a full mobile phone maybe a remote that has some other kind of useful function .
19823	0	a	Yeah .
19824	0	a	The clapper .
19825	0	a	No
19826	0	a	I mean
19827	0	a	no ,
19828	0	a	good idea , good idea .
19829	0	a	We will see what see what
19830	0	a	Uh huh y I like that
19831	0	a	Yeah .
19832	1	a	Maybe a remote with changeable faces , like the faces that you can buy for phones .
19833	0	a	I like the little cover thingies .
19834	0	a	Nice .
19835	0	a	Yeah .
19836	0	a	Hot .
19837	0	a	That is true ,
19838	0	a	I guess we we probably have some time ,
19839	1	a	maybe we should brainstorm a bit like what we want to do ,
19840	0	a	go back to I do not really have any .
19841	1	a	Let me bring up something about our basic goals here , what we want to accomplish .
19842	0	a	project announcement .
19843	0	a	Ts ts ts
19844	0	a	Yeah .
19845	0	a	Not so much .
19846	0	a	All right
19847	1	a	we will find them , we are on our own .
19848	0	a	Now
19849	0	a	are we also discussing kind of our initial ideas at all here ?
19850	0	a	S
19851	1	a	does anybody have any initial ideas ?
19852	1	a	But I am thinking I am thinking kind of PDA design so touch screen design rather than button
19853	0	a	so that you can kind of flip around all sorts of different things .
19854	0	a	Yeah yeah
19855	1	a	let is do it , let is do .
19856	1	a	I am going to go ahead and take notes on this too
19857	0	a	cause
19858	0	a	Yeah
19859	0	a	I mean
19860	0	a	oh yeah right .
19861	0	a	Good idea .
19862	0	a	Start your minutes .
19863	0	a	Well
19864	0	a	it is pretty much given
19865	0	a	it is going to be universal
19866	0	a	right ,
19867	0	a	we decided that already and it may be functioning for other things , as soon as you said that I was thinking like all the other things you could get a remote to do , like your microwave or your front door
19868	1	a	or like to have everything on one thing ,
19869	0	a	but then , I have never been a fan of those huge remotes that have like a million buttons ,
19870	0	a	you ca not tell what they do .
19871	0	a	So
19872	1	a	initial ideas .
19873	0	a	Yeah .
19874	0	a	Yeah .
19875	0	a	S smaller is better .
19876	1	a	Simple .
19877	0	a	Yeah .
19878	1	a	Specific .
19879	0	a	Okay .
19880	0	a	Oh right .
19881	0	a	That would be different .
19882	0	a	Interesting .
19883	0	a	Yeah
19884	0	a	that is slick
19885	0	a	is not it .
19886	0	a	I mean like
19887	0	a	stylist
19888	0	a	yeah like
19889	0	a	a just a
19890	0	a	yeah .
19891	0	a	True .
19892	0	a	Right so
19893	0	a	we got five minutes more to chat about this ,
19894	0	a	perfect .
19895	0	a	so
19896	0	a	we have got this kind of an idea of a trade off between size and functionality .
19897	0	a	and we also
19898	1	a	I am also going to note for future reference this idea
19899	0	a	of
19900	0	a	so you like
19901	0	a	maybe like an L like a touch screen type of remote ?
19902	0	a	I do not think one exists .
19903	0	a	Right .
19904	1	a	We want it to be munt multifunctional
19905	0	a	but at the same time if you get it to do too much you are not going to be able to tell them apart ,
19906	0	a	Yeah .
19907	0	a	Too confusing .
19908	0	a	It is going to be too complicated , too crowded with buttons and things .
19909	0	a	Possibly .
19910	0	a	An interesting option .
19911	0	a	Be a good idea .
19912	1	a	Needs it needs one outstanding feature to set it apart from all the other remotes .
19913	0	a	Yeah .
19914	0	a	Definitely .
19915	0	a	Yeah all the other universal remotes .
19916	0	a	I do not know if there is such a thing out there ,
19917	1	a	I guess we could do some do some research on or one of us could do some research on it
19918	0	a	about whether or not there are multi format like you know PAL , NTSC , region one
19919	0	a	Okay .
19920	0	a	Right .
19921	0	a	I am pretty sure there is .
19922	0	a	I mean
19923	0	a	I I have a friend who has a PDA that he just points at his telev any television he wants and it will figure out the the specifications of it and will control it
19924	0	a	so
19925	0	a	I th
19926	0	a	I assume that that can be done with kind of around the world .
19927	0	a	Okay .
19928	0	a	That
19929	0	a	Yeah .
19930	0	a	Interesting .
19931	0	a	Awesome .
19932	0	a	Okay .
19933	0	a	Yeah .
19934	0	a	Okay .
19935	0	a	Okay .
19936	0	a	all right .
19937	0	a	So .
19938	0	a	I li
19939	0	a	I am liking that idea , this idea of a touch screen remote with multi format features .
19940	0	a	Right .
19941	0	a	Let is see .
19942	1	a	I think , making it out of a nice material would be very important ,
19943	0	a	because so many of those remotes that you see , these universal remotes look so cheap and low quality .
19944	0	a	Yeah .
19945	0	a	Yeah .
19946	1	a	Keeping it nice and slick , would be important .
19947	0	a	And
19948	0	a	I do not know ,
19949	0	a	like ,
19950	0	a	there is such a problem with losing them ,
19951	0	a	that adding this whole like PDA pen business is only one more thing to lose ,
19952	1	a	so we are going to have to be careful with what like Just something like keep in mind when we start actually dealing with this stuff
19953	0	a	but that would be really cool .
19954	0	a	Oh .
19955	0	a	let is see .
19956	0	a	I like the idea of the multi plate .
19957	0	a	Yeah
19958	0	a	yeah okay .
19959	0	a	Yeah .
19960	0	a	Fi b
19961	0	a	like
19962	0	a	what are they called , those face plate things ?
19963	0	a	Is not there a name for them ?
19964	0	a	Are they ?
19965	0	a	I dunno .
19966	0	a	In in
19967	0	a	I like .
19968	0	a	Think they are just called face plates ?
19969	0	a	I do not know .
19970	0	a	something ,
19971	1	a	we will have to come up with a name , patent it .
19972	1	a	We should c
19973	1	a	we should come up with a fuzzy one as well .
19974	0	a	Yeah .
19975	1	a	Something really cool .
19976	0	a	For those cold winter days .
19977	1	a	Leopard print or something .
19978	1	a	Leopard print .
19979	0	a	I think , it would not be such a bad idea to have a like a locator device ,
19980	1	a	maybe a simple button that you have on your television to help you find your remote .
19981	0	a	True .
19982	0	a	But if we are bundling it unless we are selling their telly with the remote .
19983	0	a	Right .
19984	1	a	Cou could we not do something where like just a little lit like literally just a very small kind of thing that comes with the remote that you could place something else that you press and it makes the remote page .
19985	0	a	Well
19986	1	a	if we bundle it as a phone then you can always call it .
19987	0	a	True .
19988	1	a	If you are not doing that then we can have something that just kind of rings from either
19989	0	a	well
19990	0	a	there used to be those whistling devices
19991	0	a	but that is a little bit annoying .
19992	0	a	True .
19993	0	a	Right .
19994	0	a	Kinda like how on a lot of cordless regular phones , you have a page button and it goes ,
19995	0	a	could we do something like that ?
19996	0	a	yeah
19997	1	a	I think this material quality as well like I guess what we can think about what kind of
19998	0	a	you know Apple is been really successful with this surgical white kind of business or this sleek kind of
19999	0	a	you know
20000	0	a	Yeah .
20001	0	a	Th
20002	0	a	Yeah .
20003	0	a	Right .
20004	0	a	Yeah .
20005	0	a	Right .
20006	0	a	That is cool .
20007	0	a	I think so .
20008	0	a	Probably .
20009	0	a	I think we could design into that .
20010	0	a	Yeah .
20011	0	a	Good .
20012	0	a	Yeah .
20013	0	a	And that titanium the new silver sleek ones that is last couple of years , very much so .
20014	1	a	Curves .
20015	0	a	Yeah .
20016	0	a	We do have the minimum am amount
20017	0	a	I mean
20018	0	a	we were talking finances
20019	0	a	I dunno ,
20020	0	a	selling a a forty Pound remote would h or a forty Dollar remote , twenty five Euro remote would be pretty you know it is pretty expensive
20021	1	a	so maybe we might want to trade off some of the features for a lower price .
20022	0	a	Right .
20023	1	a	Without without getting into that whole like you know go down to bargain store remote you know bargain store universal remote
20024	0	a	that is black and you know m massive ,
20025	1	a	some kind of I dunno a balance there in somewhere .
20026	0	a	Right .
20027	0	a	Yeah .
20028	0	a	Definitely .
20029	1	a	But have a think about what we can do , have a think about what we want to do , how we are going to sell it
20030	0	a	and
20031	0	a	Yeah .
20032	0	a	Or if you our users in mind ,
20033	0	a	like
20034	0	a	these grandmas are not going to be into this whole new let is design ,
20035	0	a	no it is
20036	0	a	they are used to the buttons
20037	1	a	so we will have to be careful of exactly who we are marketing this to , and who we are going to be able to get it out of .
20038	0	a	Yeah .
20039	0	a	Is true .
20040	0	a	But
20041	0	a	Euros .
20042	0	a	We are talking twenty five Pounds or twenty five Euros ?
20043	0	a	Slight difference I guess .
20044	0	a	Twenty five Euros .
20045	0	a	Yeah .
20046	0	a	They are all weaker than
20047	0	a	they are all stronger than the Dollar .
20048	0	a	Although , computer parts , all
20049	1	a	if you are going to upgrade your computer , buy it in the States .
20050	0	a	Like
20051	0	a	do you guys know Fry is ?
20052	0	a	Huge computer electronics store ?
20053	0	a	They serve right
20054	0	a	they sa tha
20055	0	a	s
20056	0	a	they will sell things overseas so you can buy stuff in America and have it shipped over for like twenty thirty Pounds about .
20057	0	a	No .
20058	0	a	Mm mm .
20059	0	a	Right so
20060	1	a	let is go ahead and wrap that up here for now ,
20061	1	a	I am going to put these initial ideas that we have got in the project documents ,
20062	1	a	so if you guys wa need a reminder about what we have talked about the different you know kind of trade offs that we have got and the other ideas , you can consult them at your leisure .
20063	0	a	Okay .
20064	0	a	Okay .
20065	0	a	And right so
20066	0	a	thanks for that .
20067	1	a	Let is just head back to work on what we were talking about
20068	0	a	bef goi h h getting into .
20069	0	a	With half an hour ?
20070	0	a	Kay .
20071	0	a	Yes .
20072	0	a	Perfect .
20073	0	a	 
20074	0	a	All set ?
20075	0	a	Okay .
20076	0	a	Cool .
20077	0	a	Right .
20078	0	a	So basically
20079	1	a	I am just going to go over real quickly some news I have just got from the board on how we are supposed to do with this remote control .
20080	1	a	And then I am going to turn over to you guys to make brief presentations on what you have found
20081	1	a	and then we will have a bit of discussion .
20082	0	a	So basically
20083	0	a	what I have just found out from the board
20084	0	a	I dunno if you guys got this email as well
20085	0	a	but it needs to be television only .
20086	0	a	So no
20087	0	a	we are not doing DVD , we are not doing anything else , it is just going to be a television remote .
20088	0	a	Okay .
20089	0	a	it also needs to have the company colours included in it .
20090	0	a	so
20091	0	a	that is red and black .
20092	0	a	And it has to have the slogan , case you guys forget the slogan it is , we put fashion in electronics .
20093	0	a	and no teletext .
20094	0	a	I am not sure what teletext is but I am assuming you guys do , so we do not want to include that in this particular design .
20095	0	a	For reasons that I do not really know .
20096	0	a	There is
20097	0	a	but it is the board so there you go .
20098	0	a	So basically
20099	0	a	given those guidelines which will have some effect on how we design
20100	1	a	we will discuss it later
20101	0	a	I mean
20102	0	a	cause it is television only
20103	0	a	we will be able to change our
20104	0	a	well
20105	1	a	we can s sacrifice more function for a better television remote .
20106	0	a	Anyway .
20107	0	a	So
20108	1	a	I am going to turn over to the Industrial Designer to go ahead and make a presentation
20109	0	a	on
20110	0	a	Oh ,
20111	0	a	right
20112	0	a	yeah .
20113	0	a	Okay .
20114	0	a	So do I unplug this bit here ?
20115	0	a	Okay .
20116	0	a	Gotta plug you in .
20117	0	a	Yep .
20118	1	a	Might have to hit function F eight
20119	0	a	but it looks like it is going to come up .
20120	0	a	Yep .
20121	0	a	Cool .
20122	0	a	Right .
20123	0	a	That is page one of my presentation .
20124	0	a	Brilliant .
20125	0	a	Very nice .
20126	0	a	For your first PowerPoint it is lovely .
20127	0	a	So
20128	1	a	the method .
20129	1	a	We are going to have to understand how remote controls work and res successfully complete this project .
20130	0	a	remote control works as follows .
20131	0	a	This is all pretty basic stuff you guys .
20132	0	a	sends message to another system ,
20133	0	a	so
20134	0	a	there is an energy source involved in that like a battery or solar power , something along those lines , there is an integrated circuit , which is the microchip , and that actually compose the messages and usually the way
20135	0	a	a a remote control works is it sends infrared bits to another system .
20136	0	a	A user interface controls the chip , basically that is the casing and the buttons and accordingly the messages as well .
20137	0	a	So
20138	1	a	my findings ,
20139	0	a	I just did a preliminary study here
20140	0	a	and I found that too much metal in remote design could potentially cause interference with the ability of the remote to send commands .
20141	0	a	And too much metal can cause remotes to behave unexpectedly by receiving false signals .
20142	0	a	too much metal is used sometimes and people pick up radio signals and the like , and there is also the possibility of the remote catching on fire and injuring the customer ,
20143	0	a	just think of those lawsuits , that would be really bad .
20144	1	a	Therefore I suggest primarily plastic construction .
20145	0	a	Kay .
20146	1	a	, components .
20147	1	a	Just some ideas that I had , , energy source ,
20148	0	a	it is kind of hip to be eco friendly
20149	1	a	so I thought maybe we could do something with solar power with an alkaline battery backup .
20150	1	a	the user interface ,
20151	0	a	I was
20152	0	a	since we ca not use metal
20153	1	a	I was thinking maybe a high grade recycled plastic .
20154	1	a	The chip , , silicon based chip I do not really see any way around that ,
20155	0	a	we ca not really be different in that respect .
20156	1	a	, the sender well I am thinking infrared
20157	0	a	cause it is the industry standard ,
20158	1	a	multi channel ,
20159	0	a	that is a word I made up ,
20160	0	a	I do not really know what it means .
20161	0	a	Kay .
20162	1	a	PAL and NTSC compatible and probably a two hundred foot range .
20163	0	a	Fair enough .
20164	0	a	Kay .
20165	1	a	and the receiver of course is any number of electronic devices .
20166	0	a	but in this case it will only be TVs .
20167	1	a	personal preferences ,
20168	1	a	I really think that we should use plastic as opposed to metal ,
20169	0	a	, the company simply ca not afford this kinds of lawsuits
20170	0	a	which adm admittedly is going to come at the cost of a certain aesthetic value ,
20171	0	a	cause we were thinking
20172	0	a	Right .
20173	0	a	Fine .
20174	0	a	Is is there a way that we can use modern types of polymers , or mo modern types of plastics
20175	0	a	that maybe do have some kind of aesthetic value
20176	0	a	like
20177	0	a	if a white
20178	0	a	like
20179	0	a	if we talk about
20180	0	a	like well like
20181	0	a	on the lapt on these laptops and other ones they use a a pretty nice ,
20182	0	a	you can do i is there some kind of nice colo der quality plastic that we can work with ?
20183	0	a	Okay , okay .
20184	0	a	It needs , yeah .
20185	0	a	Yeah that should not be a problem .
20186	0	a	for example the plastic they have on your laptop there is something that is perfectly possible for us to do .
20187	0	a	Cool .
20188	0	a	That is the end of my presentation .
20189	0	a	Great .
20190	0	a	Thank you very much Nathan .
20191	1	a	if next we can have the User Interface Developer go ahead and make a brief presentation that would be great as well .
20192	0	a	S
20193	1	a	plug yourself in here .
20194	1	a	hit function F eight real quickly , hold down
20195	0	a	Looks like you are in okay .
20196	0	a	Is it plugged in well ?
20197	0	a	There it goes .
20198	0	a	Computer adjusting .
20199	0	a	Th
20200	0	a	Well so .
20201	0	a	There you go .
20202	0	a	There you go .
20203	0	a	Sweet .
20204	0	a	Here we have a my technical functions design presentation .
20205	1	a	so a few of the requirements we need here .
20206	0	a	we n basically need to operate an electronic device , it needs to be universal and possibly operate several different types of devices although we now find that that that is no problem .
20207	0	a	Yeah
20208	0	a	sorry I could not get that g to use before .
20209	0	a	so
20210	1	a	some of my findings .
20211	0	a	basically want to send messages to a television set .
20212	0	a	that would be any number of different things such as switch on the television , switch to the next channel , that sort of thing ,
20213	0	a	I think we are all quite quite intelligent
20214	0	a	and know know what a normal remote control does .
20215	0	a	now
20216	0	a	some of the other things I found is a a complicated remote control
20217	0	a	sorry that we ca not quite see my red there very well
20218	0	a	but this remote control has many functions so it can do a lot of things
20219	0	a	but it it is quite complicated
20220	0	a	and most users will find it find that they wo not use most of the functions because they do not know how to use them and do not want to take the time to learn how to do it .
20221	0	a	Oh yeah look at that .
20222	0	a	As you also notice it is quite a boring design .
20223	0	a	Another remote control , slightly different
20224	0	a	, it is a simpler remote control many less buttons but has many fewer functions ,
20225	0	a	m much easier for the user to manipulate and use .
20226	0	a	it also has a bit of a cheap look and it is also quite boring .
20227	0	a	So
20228	1	a	my personal preferences .
20229	1	a	Revolutionise the idea of a remote control .
20230	0	a	Nice .
20231	1	a	so attain the functionality of a complicated device but use a simple formatted display for the user to to work with .
20232	0	a	And I was going to add another slide here
20233	0	a	but I did not quite have time there .
20234	0	a	Okay .
20235	0	a	Just incorporating some of the ideas that we had previously like having multiple face
20236	0	a	but it is .
20237	0	a	Great .
20238	0	a	Thanks for that Ron .
20239	0	a	Right .
20240	0	a	Does that mean I am up ?
20241	0	a	I think so .
20242	0	a	Kay
20243	0	a	yep that is you .
20244	0	a	Okay .
20245	1	a	I can plug you in .
20246	0	a	Oh that would be perfect .
20247	0	a	Thank you .
20248	0	a	Slide show up and running .
20249	0	a	Or not .
20250	1	a	Give it a little bit .
20251	0	a	Oh
20252	0	a	there we go .
20253	0	a	Perfect .
20254	0	a	Okay .
20255	0	a	So
20256	0	a	this is me .
20257	0	a	basically
20258	0	a	I was looking through some marketing reports that we have got and we had a usability test where we were actually sort like watching a hundred people use TV remotes and see what it is that they are using
20259	0	a	and then they filled out a questionnaire about what they like and
20260	0	a	what they do not about their general TV remote control practices .
20261	0	a	pretty much through testing we were finding out that most of the time , everybody is used to using changing the channel , turning it on , using the volume ,
20262	0	a	m
20263	0	a	the majority of the time that is all that is going on , the other functions happen , for some people they are important , but the primary uses are really really basic .
20264	0	a	and so big complicated remotes like one we saw in the last presentation are really not the general public is use , they are not using a lot of it , they do not need it , they even find it frustrating when there are all those buttons that they do not know what to do with .
20265	0	a	And we also found out that fifty percent of our people , their the worst thing about a remote is how often they lose it .
20266	0	a	And then they ca not find it in the room .
20267	0	a	So I think what we were talking about with a pager or something , will really come into play with a lot of these people .
20268	0	a	there is also a survey about what they liked about remotes , and pretty much they all think they are hideous and not very useful , and the younger demographics are all really interested in voice recognition options .
20269	0	a	I do not know if that is something we are ready to look into technically , that is up to the design people ,
20270	1	a	but it is s something worth thinking about ,
20271	0	a	especially since the younger demographic is obviously the one that is going to keep growing ,
20272	1	a	so if that is the direction we are headed in it is something to think about .
20273	1	a	but basically it really is the primary functions and getting it to look nice , which are the standards .
20274	0	a	So it is a good start for us .
20275	0	a	That is great .
20276	0	a	Thank you Sarah .
20277	0	a	Right .
20278	0	a	Need to unplug this ?
20279	0	a	Need it back .
20280	0	a	So
20281	0	a	yep
20282	1	a	I will just switch that back here .
20283	1	a	I will finish up with just a bit of discussion plan on for the next phase .
20284	1	a	There you go .
20285	0	a	Right so
20286	0	a	I think we have covered most of these important questions through this through you guys is presentations we have got y the Industrial Designer suggests or pretty much emphatically suggested that we need to go with plastic .
20287	0	a	Sarah , she is recommended that we go for simpler functions , so fewer functions
20288	1	a	but we need to decide who are we selling this to ,
20289	0	a	you s your stats suggested that seventy five percent of people under thirty five wanted , thought about voice control ,
20290	0	a	so do we want to go for that , or do we want to go for an older demographic ,
20291	0	a	and my thought is we have got w
20292	0	a	if we are going to go for a sleek look
20293	0	a	I mean we are putting the fashion in electronics .
20294	0	a	Oh right .
20295	1	a	We are not catering to the pensioners of the world I do not think so .
20296	0	a	Yes .
20297	1	a	So maybe this we should look into this younger demographic .
20298	0	a	Right .
20299	0	a	So
20300	1	a	we need to wonder h about how we make it better and smaller and faster
20301	0	a	think we are constrained to plastics
20302	0	a	very well ,
20303	0	a	we have got this idea , Ron was saying we need to think about revolutionising the way it is looking ,
20304	0	a	which might be easier
20305	0	a	given that we are going for simpler function and that we are only going for a telly .
20306	0	a	Right .
20307	0	a	so .
20308	0	a	How th
20309	0	a	this voice operation thing is I think is a good idea assuming that it is doable , at least for the basic controls ,
20310	1	a	maybe we can balance it that way , you know we can see .
20311	0	a	Right .
20312	0	a	Okay
20313	0	a	you ca not say record alias tonight at seven PM
20314	1	a	but we might be able to say volume up .
20315	0	a	Yeah .
20316	0	a	Right .
20317	1	a	I think it would be possible to combine the locator device and the voice recognition technology .
20318	0	a	Oh .
20319	0	a	That could work .
20320	0	a	I like that .
20321	1	a	With a simple command like locate .
20322	0	a	Yeah .
20323	1	a	And then it could start to beep
20324	0	a	and
20325	0	a	therefore be found .
20326	1	a	Something very basic .
20327	0	a	Right .
20328	0	a	Right .
20329	0	a	Sounds good .
20330	0	a	Is that only going to be within our two hundred foot range then ?
20331	0	a	Okay .
20332	0	a	Oh yeah
20333	0	a	I think that is very doable .
20334	0	a	The difficulty wh would be in
20335	0	a	I think like i you could not speak into the remote that you are trying to find .
20336	0	a	Kay
20337	1	a	you have something that picks up a voice from far away If it is hidden under the couch
20338	1	a	but then again you have this wee
20339	1	a	this wee thing
20340	1	a	you know that is just a little chip or whatever that has the page button , maybe that could be voice activated too .
20341	0	a	Yeah .
20342	0	a	It is a good point .
20343	1	a	A little sticky pad to stick on top of your television .
20344	1	a	And you just say something to into that
20345	0	a	and it finds your
20346	1	a	The other thing is we might be able to handle the simplicity of a remote control and kind of put the more complicated things into a voice control .
20347	0	a	Yeah .
20348	0	a	Yeah .
20349	0	a	Yeah .
20350	0	a	K
20351	0	a	Yeah .
20352	1	a	Or an isolated magnet or something like , or you know something that would not interfere
20353	0	a	I do not know that would be the technical thing
20354	0	a	but yeah I like that ,
20355	0	a	I like that , the voice recognition for the paging system .
20356	0	a	So it could be sold to both the younger market and the older market .
20357	0	a	True .
20358	0	a	And the younger market could use kind of the voi voice control method
20359	0	a	and the older market might might k
20360	0	a	exactly and might consider the older market could use the simpler design with the traditional buttons and what not .
20361	0	a	Making it just an option ?
20362	0	a	Yeah .
20363	0	a	Right .
20364	0	a	I was thinking
20365	1	a	Oh go ahead .
20366	0	a	Yeah .
20367	0	a	Are we still thinking about this screen
20368	0	a	sorry .
20369	1	a	Go ahead .
20370	0	a	The
20371	0	a	if we are going to do this touch pad screen thing , it would be still , do we know if that is an option technically right now to that ?
20372	0	a	Okay .
20373	0	a	Is definitely an option technically .
20374	0	a	I have looked into costs of touch screen methods and what not , they seem to be you know almost as cheap as a button method at this point .
20375	0	a	Okay .
20376	0	a	We are doing okay .
20377	0	a	Cause it seems like an interesting option
20378	0	a	especially because then you could have like your primary screen just be these you know four or five basic functions , you can have menu options or something to have all these other complicated voice recognition , settings , things that you are not going to use every day and that a lot of people are not going to use but it is an option there for this hi tech market that sort of re is the sleek thing we are going for .
20379	0	a	Okay .
20380	0	a	Yeah .
20381	0	a	Gotta wonder though , if we are adding so much technology to this one remote , are we still going to be able to meet out twelve pou our twelve fifty Euro
20382	0	a	you know goal for selling these things .
20383	0	a	True .
20384	1	a	Worth looking into .
20385	0	a	It seems like , we are not going to be able to handle all these functions with just one microchip .
20386	0	a	Yeah .
20387	0	a	The microchip is probably the most expensive part of the the whole mechanism .
20388	0	a	True .
20389	0	a	Okay .
20390	0	a	Yeah .
20391	1	a	So it is just something to consider .
20392	0	a	Okay .
20393	0	a	Absolutely .
20394	0	a	kay well yeah
20395	0	a	I guess we will cross that bridge in a la slightly later stages of development
20396	0	a	but yeah I know , that is perfectly viable question .
20397	0	a	kay so
20398	0	a	I am seeing that we are going to just basically focus on this young demographic group , aim it at them , but then in a sense that its bells and whistles are available for anybody who wants them but basically we will make a sleek simple functioned remote control .
20399	0	a	I think this voice recognition thing is a we have got a market for it
20400	0	a	I do not think there is too many , we would more or less be cornering the market on it as well ,
20401	0	a	we do not have many .
20402	0	a	Yeah .
20403	0	a	I appear to have lost my microphone .
20404	0	a	Right
20405	0	a	we do not have many people
20406	0	a	or there is not very many competitors out there that do that
20407	0	a	so cool .
20408	0	a	right .
20409	0	a	I guess we have c
20410	0	a	we have touched on most of this .
20411	0	a	The idea of a paging function , a touch screen , and face plates .
20412	0	a	The thing with I see would there not be a
20413	0	a	we would have to maybe sacrifice the face plates for a touch screen ?
20414	0	a	Okay .
20415	0	a	I am not sure that is sincerely correct ,
20416	0	a	I think if you kind of take the example of a mobile phone that trying to pass a portion of the device is not interchangeable whereas the surrounding portions are interchangeable .
20417	0	a	Okay .
20418	0	a	Just the casing .
20419	0	a	We could have the casing , the the face plates .
20420	0	a	Okay .
20421	1	a	Back to the the cost the material .
20422	0	a	We have to ask whether we are going to include a certain number of face plates with the package ?
20423	0	a	That is something I w for
20424	0	a	say we are including three or four face plates , it is going to drive the cost up .
20425	0	a	And the other question is , if we do include them are we really in a position to evaluate that market ?
20426	0	a	We have not done any tests on face plates and whether See if there if there is even interest out there .
20427	0	a	Yeah .
20428	0	a	Right .
20429	0	a	Okay .
20430	0	a	Okay .
20431	0	a	Right .
20432	0	a	Off the top of my head it sounds kind of like a gimmick that would not really go anywhere .
20433	0	a	Yeah
20434	0	a	cause then ha you would have to who all
20435	0	a	it is not like with cell phones like where you have a you know Nokia model X
20436	0	a	and then ten people make face plates for it , we would be just our model of pho of t remote control .
20437	0	a	Right .
20438	0	a	Yeah .
20439	0	a	Well
20440	0	a	in the publicity of a face plate on a phone is you have it out and around , it is sort of emblematic whereas you are just sit at home ,
20441	0	a	so unless somebody comes over to watch TV
20442	0	a	True .
20443	0	a	Yeah .
20444	0	a	Well
20445	0	a	hopefully some people have people coming t over to w to hang out at your house and most people have their televisions in the living room .
20446	0	a	True .
20447	0	a	True .
20448	0	a	Alright well
20449	1	a	we can we can discuss that one further when we think about whether th when we do costs and so forth , .
20450	0	a	Yeah .
20451	0	a	Oh
20452	0	a	yeah .
20453	0	a	Sure .
20454	0	a	True , if plastic is dead cheap and if we are making the whole thing out of plastic anyway
20455	0	a	yeah
20456	1	a	we will cross that bridge later
20457	1	a	but yeah we will have to evaluate what is most important .
20458	0	a	I think we have had a bit of discussion already on this thing ,
20459	0	a	n
20460	0	a	s there any other questions comments that came up in these presentations ?
20461	0	a	Yeah
20462	0	a	yeah okay .
20463	0	a	Well
20464	0	a	have we confirmed that we are going to go ahead with a touch screen Interface ?
20465	0	a	So
20466	0	a	these new lithium batteries they last twenty years even with the touch screen ?
20467	0	a	Those new ones .
20468	0	a	Yeah I think that would be best .
20469	0	a	Let is
20470	1	a	based on what sh on what you guys have all said to me let is go for a plastic built or b plastic cased
20471	0	a	cause tha tha that is easy on the cost ,
20472	1	a	try to look for some kind of high quality recycled plastic
20473	0	a	as you recommended
20474	0	a	and I think that is a great idea .
20475	1	a	With a touch screen for the basic functions .
20476	0	a	And we will
20477	0	a	yeah
20478	0	a	tha
20479	1	a	let is provisionally let is go for a touch screen one with several submenus for possible extra stuff
20480	0	a	that one
20481	1	a	basically put the channel and the on and off switch on the touch screen .
20482	0	a	do we have
20483	1	a	wait a minute
20484	0	a	it occurs to me that if we have a touch screen people are going to have to recharge their remote controls .
20485	0	a	Yet at the same time that might help for this whole complaint of it being lost .
20486	0	a	True .
20487	0	a	Cause it would have a docking base ?
20488	0	a	Yeah .
20489	0	a	But then again that costs as well .
20490	0	a	Do they ?
20491	0	a	Okay .
20492	0	a	Can we afford that ?
20493	0	a	And will somebody buy it if we do not ?
20494	0	a	Right .
20495	0	a	Can we afford to include one of those ?
20496	0	a	Right .
20497	0	a	Well
20498	0	a	I I do not think
20499	0	a	yeah
20500	0	a	I ca not see anybody buying a lap a remote control that they have to plug in
20501	1	a	so we would have to see some kind of new battery technology .
20502	0	a	Okay so
20503	1	a	let is go with a touch screen with some kind of you know with with some kind of cutting edge battery technology
20504	0	a	Yeah well hey you know well
20505	1	a	it is it is worth looking into , if not we can always default to just doing a a well presented plastic simple
20506	0	a	you know
20507	0	a	so you know .
20508	0	a	For twelve Euros ?
20509	0	a	It is .
20510	0	a	Fair enough .
20511	0	a	The basics .
20512	0	a	Well yeah
20513	0	a	I mean
20514	0	a	you can put the we could I
20515	0	a	I dunno
20516	1	a	I mean I suppose we could put the the basics on the centre easiest
20517	0	a	you know , you know
20518	0	a	people know the channel and volume function
20519	1	a	make them large and easy to get at and then the the other the other bits and bobs you know go through menu w we will do the aesthetics .
20520	0	a	Okay so
20521	1	a	we will touch screen and the battery , focus on presentation .
20522	0	a	Kay .
20523	1	a	it is th with this voice recognition option as well just as for the simple functions the the on off , channels , volume , and a small paging function .
20524	1	a	Even if you ca not do voice recognition for the paging you know just some kind of simple button that is just
20525	1	a	a I guess another infrared signal to the remote control
20526	0	a	and while
20527	1	a	to emit some kind of paging .
20528	1	a	Just a beep .
20529	0	a	Okay .
20530	0	a	right so
20531	0	a	any comments ?
20532	0	a	Thoughts
20533	1	a	before we break into go into the next round of individual work on this .
20534	0	a	Since we are doing touch screen , do we want to look into the possibility of people being able to input different types of skins for the you know the actual interface part of it and things like that ?
20535	0	a	Or is it just going to be one touch screen for everybody .
20536	0	a	Be interesting .
20537	1	a	What what would be on that touch screen ?
20538	0	a	Cause you said earlier that we have to think about company colours and logo or something or motto ,
20539	0	a	I ca not remember exactly what you said .
20540	0	a	And oh .
20541	0	a	Yeah
20542	0	a	the the fashion
20543	0	a	do .
20544	0	a	We put fashion into electronics .
20545	0	a	Yeah .
20546	0	a	W
20547	0	a	it is my understanding that if you were going to do a skin you would need to have some way for people to download or import skins into the remote control .
20548	0	a	Right ,
20549	0	a	and then you are dealing with ports and cords and
20550	0	a	Yeah .
20551	0	a	Yeah
20552	0	a	I think perhaps
20553	0	a	good idea
20554	0	a	but
20555	0	a	yeah
20556	0	a	I think that that one m might just be and they just
20557	0	a	yeah
20558	0	a	I think that one might just be out of the range for this particular
20559	0	a	a PDA would they would
20560	0	a	makes a lot of sense for a PDA cause you are going to be using it to connect up to things anyway
20561	0	a	but
20562	0	a	I dunno ,
20563	0	a	what do you guys think ?
20564	0	a	Is too much .
20565	0	a	For now .
20566	1	a	Think we just need to come up with a nice black and red interface on the touch screen .
20567	0	a	Yeah .
20568	0	a	Nice .
20569	0	a	That would be okay .
20570	0	a	Yeah .
20571	0	a	I I am I am in agreement with that ,
20572	1	a	I am wondering how we are going to get we put fashion into electronics onto this device .
20573	0	a	Well
20574	1	a	but if we are going to use a touch screen where it is going to come on like on your cell phone
20575	0	a	it will have your your carrier provider name come up first like while it is loading
20576	0	a	and then it goes away ,
20577	1	a	perhaps it could be like a temporary Comes on every time you turn it on and then that is it
20578	0	a	cause it is a bit much to have it like engraved on the back or something I think .
20579	0	a	Yeah .
20580	0	a	True .
20581	0	a	Yeah .
20582	0	a	I am hoping for a subliminal maybe half a millisecond as it turns on .
20583	0	a	Yeah .
20584	0	a	Y
20585	0	a	Yeah you would think .
20586	0	a	Yeah .
20587	0	a	Yeah I know
20588	0	a	I d
20589	1	a	it seems like it would suffice to have just the RR on there .
20590	0	a	Jus
20591	0	a	But apparently not .
20592	0	a	But .
20593	0	a	If it comes from above .
20594	0	a	People are not going to want their remote to boot up and to see flashing things come on .
20595	0	a	So .
20596	0	a	Yeah .
20597	0	a	Yeah .
20598	0	a	Well
20599	0	a	fair enough .
20600	0	a	and yeah
20601	0	a	that would help the battery life too
20602	0	a	and if it the remote they do have to press a button for the remote to turn on .
20603	0	a	But then again who wants to turn on a remote control .
20604	0	a	Well
20605	1	a	all you have to do is touch the screen
20606	0	a	and it automatically goes on .
20607	0	a	Kind of if i
20608	0	a	Oh
20609	0	a	to wake up
20610	0	a	okay
20611	0	a	or go into like a dormant mode .
20612	0	a	Yep .
20613	0	a	Goes into a sleep mode .
20614	0	a	Okay .
20615	0	a	Oh yeah
20616	0	a	I like that I like the idea of putting the logo in the boot up screen , nice .
20617	0	a	cool
20618	0	a	so
20619	0	a	any last things before we break ?
20620	0	a	Alright .
20621	0	a	Fair enough .
20622	0	a	We are good ?
20623	0	a	Sounds good .
20624	1	a	I am going to save th a copy of this in case you guys need any reminders .
20625	1	a	I am going to save a copy of this and the minutes that I will do it in a second and put them in the shared folder for later reference .
20626	0	a	Brilliant .
20627	0	a	That is fab guys .
20628	0	a	 
20629	0	a	That went well ,
20630	0	a	thank you .
20631	0	a	That is great .
20632	0	a	Perfect .
20633	0	a	Kay .
20634	0	a	Alright ,
20635	1	a	let me just PowerPoint this up .
20636	0	a	Right so
20637	0	a	this meeting will be about the conceptual design ,
20638	1	a	do not ask me s precisely what conceptual design is ,
20639	0	a	it is just something important that we need to do .
20640	0	a	, think of it is kind of turning the abstract into slightly more concrete .
20641	0	a	In this meeting ideally we will come to some final decisions on what we are going to do for the prototype .
20642	0	a	Right so ,
20643	0	a	apologies for the last meeting ,
20644	0	a	it was brought to my attention that I did not make the roles clear enough ,
20645	1	a	, so I will attempt to do so more accurately in this particular meeting .
20646	0	a	, fair enough ,
20647	0	a	thanks for the input ,
20648	0	a	is always good .
20649	0	a	So ,
20650	0	a	basically all we are going to do is have some presentations again much like last time , , and going to go through you ,
20651	1	a	whoever wants to go first is f fine by me
20652	0	a	and we will collate what we know about what we discussed in the last meeting , possible directions .
20653	0	a	And then we will make some more decisions on basic firm up our idea on how we want this remote control to look and work .
20654	0	a	So ,
20655	0	a	perfect .
20656	0	a	So ,
20657	1	a	without th further ado , whoever wants to go first is free to .
20658	1	a	I will go first .
20659	1	a	Go ahead .
20660	0	a	Alright Nathan ,
20661	1	a	take it away .
20662	0	a	It is Nathan right ?
20663	0	a	I am not calling you the wrong name over and over again ?
20664	0	a	Good .
20665	0	a	No Nathan is fine .
20666	0	a	It is either Nathan or participant two .
20667	0	a	Mister participant two that is .
20668	0	a	Nice .
20669	0	a	Okay .
20670	0	a	Nice .
20671	0	a	basically what I am going to have to talk to you about today is component design
20672	0	a	and it is been brought to my attention that we may be somewhat limited as to what we can do because of what our manufacturer offers ,
20673	0	a	so
20674	0	a	Basically what I am going to be doing is talking to you about that .
20675	0	a	, components of a remote control , okay .
20676	0	a	We have already kind of gone over this
20677	1	a	but we are going to have to get into more detail and probably have to reach some conclusions some time soon .
20678	0	a	Energy source , , our manufacturer offers a variety of energy sources , your standard battery , solar cells .
20679	0	a	Our manufacturer did not say anything about lithium
20680	0	a	so we might have to look
20681	0	a	if we do go that route , we might have to look elsewhere .
20682	0	a	, and also there is a kinetic energy possibility .
20683	0	a	Basically , it is like a the idea of moving the remote would create enough energy to keep it running .
20684	0	a	So that is one possibility
20685	0	a	but I do not know whether that would be powerful enough to illuminate a touch screen .
20686	1	a	So we will have to look into that .
20687	0	a	, the case , we have a few options , plastic , rubber or wood .
20688	1	a	and then as far as the way it is shaped , we can do standard boring flat ,
20689	0	a	which we probably do not want to do ,
20690	1	a	curved or very sexy double curved .
20691	1	a	What kind of th thickness are we looking at ?
20692	0	a	Okay ,
20693	0	a	brilliant .
20694	1	a	, I imagine that we could specify .
20695	1	a	, I do not see any reason to go outside of the convention of three or four millimetres .
20696	1	a	Yeah .
20697	0	a	, the buttons , there are multiple scroll buttons available from our manufacturer , but to use those we would have to use more chips , and that would cost us more .
20698	0	a	And if we do go with the rubber doubled curved case we will have to use rubber push buttons because the other buttons are not compatible with that .
20699	0	a	Right .
20700	0	a	and just a little note there , touch screen equals many chips which equals many Euro .
20701	0	a	Right .
20702	0	a	Nice .
20703	0	a	, one thing that I noticed was that most remotes operate on a infrare on the infrared part of the spectrum .
20704	0	a	So you notice when you push a button on a remote you ca not see anything coming out of it but in fact there is light coming out of the remote
20705	0	a	and you know the television can detect that .
20706	0	a	And if you were to record
20707	0	a	if you were to make a video recording you could actually see the light .
20708	0	a	one thing that I thought might be interesting
20709	1	a	was to use part use visible light coming out of the remote , just kind of as a fun gimmick .
20710	0	a	So you could actually see something coming out of the remote when you pushed it .
20711	0	a	Interesting .
20712	1	a	Course it would have to be a part of the spectrum that would not damage the human eye or anything like that .
20713	0	a	Good call .
20714	0	a	M
20715	0	a	Maybe
20716	1	a	is there an option that we can have that off or on
20717	0	a	so a person can select like
20718	0	a	Yeah I like the idea
20719	0	a	, it is a good idea .
20720	0	a	Choose it .
20721	0	a	Yeah .
20722	0	a	I am sure that we could do that .
20723	0	a	, of course
20724	0	a	Yeah ,
20725	0	a	just as a fun gimmick .
20726	0	a	Yeah .
20727	0	a	Just to set us apart a little bit .
20728	0	a	, and then on to the circuit board that we are going to use , also known as the chip .
20729	0	a	, we really do not have any way around the TA
20730	0	a	one one eight three five .
20731	0	a	findings ,
20732	0	a	okay ,
20733	0	a	we are very limited by what our current manufacturers can offer ,
20734	0	a	and my question to all of you is , should we look to other manufacturies or should we just make do with what we have available ?
20735	0	a	Is a bit of a challenge question .
20736	0	a	Interesting question .
20737	0	a	Well
20738	1	a	I would say shop around
20739	0	a	but with our time constraints , is that really a feasible option ?
20740	0	a	Right .
20741	0	a	Yes .
20742	0	a	Right , that is my concern too .
20743	0	a	, if we do go the lithium battery route then we will have to go outside our current manufacturer .
20744	0	a	My personal preference is
20745	1	a	I will just throw my cards on the table ,
20746	1	a	I think we should probably go the solar battery route ,
20747	0	a	just to kind of keep with the environmentally friendly theme that we have going on .
20748	0	a	, I like the idea of the visible light signalling ,
20749	0	a	that is something to set us apart
20750	1	a	and I was thinking about I was thinking of ways that we could produce the remote in a variety of different case materials to suit different tastes .
20751	0	a	So we are not so confined by one style
20752	0	a	and say some you know , say our the one
20753	0	a	if we just go with one and it does not go over well then we are in a bad situation .
20754	0	a	Right .
20755	0	a	Can we do marketing piloting too ?
20756	0	a	Try to see what kind before we launch can we see how they are received ?
20757	0	a	Okay .
20758	0	a	It is an option ,
20759	0	a	but actually there is I have got some research already on like what we are looking at and trends in casing right now which actually might even come into play beforehand
20760	0	a	, it may help us decide for now .
20761	0	a	Okay .
20762	0	a	Okay ,
20763	0	a	perfect .
20764	0	a	Great ,
20765	0	a	thank you very much Nathan .
20766	0	a	Temporarily anyway .
20767	0	a	Oh yeah , you are welcome .
20768	0	a	That is perfect ,
20769	1	a	so I guess that makes sense for you to take it from here .
20770	0	a	I guess so ,
20771	0	a	cause I found some interesting things .
20772	0	a	You waiting for me ?
20773	0	a	I know ,
20774	0	a	what a teaser ai not it .
20775	0	a	Fascinating , compelling even .
20776	0	a	Did you ?
20777	0	a	I like it , I like it .
20778	0	a	Right .
20779	0	a	So
20780	0	a	current market trends .
20781	0	a	Screen .
20782	0	a	, basically I was looking at what is going on in the remote control market right now
20783	0	a	and what is going on in other design fields , to see sort of what is what is trendy , what is new , what is happening .
20784	0	a	, remote control right now basically everybody says they want newer , fancier , more exciting they are sick of this boring , normal , functional , that we need innovative design options and there needs to be an easy user interface .
20785	0	a	the challenge is that current trends right now , across the board in fashion , in furniture , in technology , is a very organic fruit and vegetable kind of thing .
20786	1	a	Now I am not saying we should have , you know , tomato shaped remote controls or anything , but I think it is possible maybe to use natural colours , like if wood is an option , that whole organic , sleek , clean , v line thing may be something we can look into .
20787	1	a	Different skin options , or if we ca not afford this touch plate thing , or touch face screen interface , maybe having the b images be specific , like you could choose your menu bullets to be a different shape
20788	0	a	or okay ,
20789	0	a	not the example I would choose , but you know what I mean to t sort of and th apparently the feel of the next couple of years is spongy ,
20790	0	a	not something
20791	0	a	I I have come up with a
20792	1	a	though if we can get around to getting piloting , I thought maybe a casing option like not like a skin , but like a holder almost if you could do like , leather options or wood options or something
20793	0	a	Tomatoes .
20794	1	a	I should have mentioned this .
20795	1	a	As far as the rubber that we can use we can use a rubber as part of the case ,
20796	0	a	it has a consistency of those stress balls .
20797	0	a	Yes .
20798	0	a	Might be an interesting way to go .
20799	0	a	Fabulous .
20800	0	a	Slick , slick .
20801	0	a	, yeah so
20802	0	a	something to sit on for now .
20803	0	a	So
20804	1	a	overall I think we should stick with what we are finding ,
20805	0	a	everyone is looking for easy to use , technologically innovative and this fancy new
20806	0	a	I think perhaps the double curve thing and maybe this rubber option is our best way to go for right now .
20807	0	a	Interface , oh the interface graphics for the
20808	0	a	Yeah .
20809	0	a	Yeah .
20810	0	a	Well
20811	0	a	I d
20812	0	a	but then if the touch screen thing is not going to work out for us that is really a non issue .
20813	0	a	I like the idea of of rubber too
20814	0	a	because it is tends to be associated with being durable , something that you can drop and it does not matter .
20815	0	a	True .
20816	0	a	Cause so many
20817	0	a	you go to so many houses these days
20818	0	a	and you see broken remote controls .
20819	0	a	Very true .
20820	0	a	Yeah , it is like , yep
20821	0	a	it is ubiquitous
20822	0	a	is not it ?
20823	0	a	Great ,
20824	0	a	thanks for that Sarah .
20825	0	a	Very true .
20826	0	a	Taped with duck tape and what have you , you would not have that problem if you used rubber .
20827	0	a	Very much so .
20828	0	a	We could .
20829	1	a	We can have a duck tape casing .
20830	0	a	I think that goes against the whole fancy something , a new line , but worth a shot .
20831	0	a	It could go with the granola crowd .
20832	0	a	it could be , it could be ,
20833	0	a	Yeah
20834	0	a	that is what I know .
20835	0	a	No problem .
20836	1	a	Ron ?
20837	0	a	Yeah
20838	0	a	Phew .
20839	0	a	Computer is adjusting .
20840	1	a	One moment please .
20841	0	a	So
20842	0	a	interme
20843	0	a	interface concept by your faithful user interface designer .
20844	0	a	So yur user interface , guys , is basically aspects of a computer system that we can see or hear , or otherwise perceive .
20845	0	a	, commands and mechanisms , that basically user uses to control the operator operating system .
20846	0	a	Here is a d series of different remote controls that are out on the market today .
20847	1	a	I think we are definitely trying to get away from this kind of a look .
20848	0	a	, so
20849	0	a	the following are a bunch of different interface concepts .
20850	0	a	voice recognition , we we actually have some new information from our research design team
20851	1	a	but I will get to that in a moment .
20852	0	a	, so
20853	0	a	current voice recognition starts up to about eighty speech samples , and basically you record your own verbal labels c and connect them to the remote control .
20854	0	a	Now
20855	0	a	our design team , research team , has been able to set up a system in which you can teach the remote control voice c recognition system to respond to with standard responses .
20856	0	a	Like you could say good morning remote control and it will say in a sexy female voice , Good morning Joe .
20857	0	a	In fact we already have this for a coffee maker line On the remote control
20858	0	a	right .
20859	0	a	Lot of single people on the on the re on the remote control research team
20860	0	a	at the
20861	0	a	Yeah .
20862	0	a	Very true , very true .
20863	0	a	, another concept is what Apple has come up with , the spinning wheel with LC display like on the iPod which I am sure most of you know about .
20864	0	a	and then we have the scroll button with integrated push button , kind of like a modern a bit bulky , a bit crazy ,
20865	1	a	I do not think that is we are necessarily going for .
20866	0	a	No .
20867	0	a	And some special components , ideas like blocking , having the ability to block channels from your for your children and dedicated buttons for for commonly used channels and even ideas like secured or hidden programming
20868	0	a	but I again if we go with touch screen I do not think that is a big issue .
20869	0	a	and this is kind of the the big daddy of remote controls here .
20870	0	a	the jumbo universal remote control is almost impossible to misplace or lose .
20871	0	a	Yeah ,
20872	0	a	I can see .
20873	1	a	, again probably not what we are going for
20874	1	a	so I
20875	1	a	I mean my ideas here and
20876	1	a	kind of where I think we are heading is something slightly larger than a regular iPod with a hard cla c plastic casing
20877	0	a	although I think some of the suggestions we have come up with are definitely very good ideas .
20878	0	a	Okay .
20879	1	a	changeable casings our design team was possibly talking about including one extra face plate with the package
20880	0	a	to kind of set the idea that you can change it and you can try changing it and kind of get used to thinking about maybe buying another one which can add value to our bottom line .
20881	0	a	, right .
20882	1	a	touch screen interface , possibly having go to buttons being stuck into the system
20883	0	a	so those do not move away from the screen , , the important ones like power , volume and jump between channels .
20884	1	a	, and of course our voice command system which I have talked a little bit about already and the use of recognisable colours and shapes to aid recognition of the features that are around
20885	0	a	so
20886	1	a	red for power , arrows for different volume ups and downs and channels ups and downs and what not .
20887	1	a	And perhaps even adding in some stupid little jokes with the voice recognition idea
20888	0	a	like perh for instance my toastie maker that I got from my bank has jokes when it is ready .
20889	0	a	Nice .
20890	0	a	Great .
20891	0	a	And that is about it .
20892	0	a	Great , wonderful Ron , cool .
20893	0	a	Lot of good ideas , good facts to have .
20894	1	a	That is what they need , it is like a little dongle it just sticks up this further
20895	0	a	so you do not have to stand up every time , just connect it , my kingdom .
20896	0	a	Yeah .
20897	0	a	Right so ,
20898	0	a	good to know all that stuff ,
20899	0	a	thanks guys , .
20900	1	a	Now we kind of have to come to some decisions , , I figure we can just go down the line and all three of us can have a chat about it .
20901	0	a	Based on what Nathan presented as far as the various costs and benefits I think , I dunno , what do you guys think about the touch screen at this point ?
20902	0	a	Kay .
20903	0	a	I think it is our most marketable feature
20904	0	a	just because it is so new and it is something that is showing up in other places .
20905	0	a	Kay .
20906	0	a	But can we really afford it
20907	0	a	cause it looks like they would be , that would be a really main cost source then
20908	0	a	right ?
20909	0	a	Per ?
20910	0	a	Piece .
20911	0	a	My estimate is that in order to incorporate touch screen technology it is going to cost us upwards of seventeen fifty Euro per remote , yeah that is just an estimate though .
20912	0	a	To produce each one .
20913	0	a	Oh you guys are always the dampers on these projects .
20914	0	a	I know
20915	0	a	And our goal was to be under twelve fifty or we have to be under twelve fifty ?
20916	0	a	Do we remember ?
20917	0	a	Okay .
20918	0	a	You industrial designers .
20919	0	a	I know .
20920	0	a	It is fun .
20921	0	a	Well .
20922	0	a	I thought there was some flexibility with that .
20923	0	a	There is ,
20924	0	a	it is just , it is a question of and
20925	0	a	how much
20926	0	a	ca o
20927	0	a	does that mean we are going to have to increase the price to make money .
20928	0	a	Can we justify it ?
20929	0	a	Right .
20930	0	a	, from twelve fifty if we d want to get our fift hundred per cent profit margin that would mean selling it from twenty five .
20931	0	a	If you multiply seventeen fifty by two that is thirty five .
20932	0	a	So
20933	0	a	From the board ,
20934	0	a	, well
20935	0	a	That is true ,
20936	0	a	I mean And that is to be fair the the per cent of the market
20937	0	a	we are not going for mass any you know , mass sales anyway ,
20938	0	a	we are going to make
20939	0	a	I mean we we are not talking about selling eight zillion of these things
20940	0	a	, we just could not , not for twenty five Euros ,
20941	0	a	so
20942	1	a	we could probably maybe shrink the profit margins rather than selling for twenty five , sell them for thirty , but that is something that we can have finance deal with .
20943	0	a	Where do you guys come up with these numbers ?
20944	0	a	I am thinking that is definitely a good idea
20945	1	a	and I also think that we could probably come up with some sort of a cheaper means to to go about this kind of production ,
20946	0	a	my my team in the on the third floor suggested that
20947	0	a	Yeah .
20948	0	a	That is just off the top of my head , it is pending further emails .
20949	0	a	Right .
20950	0	a	Though I think that is what people would pay for , I mean if you are going to pay for an expensive high class remote , you are going to expect it to do something
20951	0	a	Yeah .
20952	0	a	It is the new
20953	0	a	it would be in a class of its own .
20954	0	a	Right .
20955	0	a	Yeah .
20956	1	a	, I say that we provisionally go with the touch screen
20957	0	a	or wh y wh what was your thought on the matter Ron ?
20958	1	a	See if we can cut some corners .
20959	0	a	Right .
20960	0	a	Well
20961	1	a	and we can look into this other manufacturing option ,
20962	0	a	and maybe we can get them somewhere else cheaper .
20963	0	a	It is true .
20964	1	a	We could initially go with what we have and if we can find them cheaper later on
20965	0	a	Yeah .
20966	0	a	Right .
20967	0	a	It is a starting point anyway ,
20968	0	a	so .
20969	0	a	No
20970	1	a	we could have a s very simple touch screen , you know ,
20971	0	a	there is always the opportunity ,
20972	1	a	if it is going to be about the size of the iPod or whatever
20973	1	a	, you know , w we
20974	1	a	yeah ,
20975	1	a	I guess we can play around with it a bit .
20976	0	a	Alright ,
20977	1	a	let is let is say that okay so the touch screen will be our our main selling point here .
20978	0	a	I mean I think that we really have two main selling points
20979	0	a	, I think that our casing and the voice recognition To be honest , we have the capa we have the design in house
20980	0	a	, I mean we have we have come up with this , with this new voice we are using it for our coffee machines already .
20981	0	a	So
20982	0	a	The voice rec thing ,
20983	0	a	I mean , if if we are looking at bottom line , now we are looking at upping the cost to seventeen to get the touch screen on ,
20984	1	a	I think we might have to drop the voice rec .
20985	0	a	Yeah
20986	0	a	cause with voice recognition
20987	0	a	I mean really this is pretty bells and whistles kind of remote .
20988	1	a	I think we would have to decide between them definitely .
20989	0	a	Yeah .
20990	1	a	Price wise .
20991	0	a	True .
20992	0	a	We have already got it .
20993	1	a	I can pass you on that email from my guy in guy down the hall .
20994	0	a	Sounds good .
20995	0	a	What do you think on it Nathan ?
20996	0	a	About the voice rec ?
20997	0	a	I think if we we do both the obviously production costs are going to go way up but it does put it into it would become the Rolls Royce of remote controls basically .
20998	0	a	Pretty much .
20999	0	a	It would be very nice .
21000	1	a	I mean we we have
21001	1	a	to r reflect back on what our market research did say .
21002	0	a	Right
21003	0	a	and they said they wanted voice recognition .
21004	0	a	Course , maybe they had not thought of this whole touch screen option , but definitely we know the market is there for voice recognition
21005	0	a	so to say we have the technology
21006	0	a	and we are not going to use it even though we know it will sell
21007	0	a	is a call I do not think I can give the highs ups .
21008	1	a	Like really I ca not go in and say no we are going to just ignore everything we know .
21009	0	a	Yeah .
21010	0	a	Does having both really up our costs ?
21011	0	a	Well my p is
21012	0	a	, I definitely have to agree with that last comment .
21013	0	a	I ca not see how it would not , I mean , there is you know the old aphorism , you can have it fast , you can have it cheap or you can have it quality ,
21014	1	a	pick two of three .
21015	0	a	You know , you ca not you ca not have all three .
21016	0	a	Yeah .
21017	0	a	Yeah ,
21018	0	a	cause you you just upping the number of chips that you need to deal with each different function .
21019	0	a	It is just impossible .
21020	0	a	Yeah .
21021	0	a	Well
21022	0	a	if we are going to pick betwe e
21023	0	a	alright
21024	1	a	so we have to pick between one of the two .
21025	0	a	Otherwise , yeah , we just it just becomes cost prohibitive .
21026	0	a	What
21027	1	a	which , which do we suspect we should hold o we should hold on to ?
21028	0	a	Kay .
21029	0	a	Well ,
21030	0	a	we already have research backing voice recognition as you know fiscally solvent .
21031	1	a	But I I I personally would tend to another direction but if that is what is going to sell I think that is what we need to go with and maybe we can table this touch screen for our next model .
21032	0	a	I would have to side with that , I think the voice recognition is simpler ,
21033	0	a	we already have the all the technology in house , it is ready to go , it is packaged ,
21034	0	a	it is
21035	0	a	, this is just off the top of my head keep in mind ,
21036	0	a	but I think the voice recognition would
21037	0	a	they are both they are both going to push the costs up , but , since we already have the technology in house for the voice recognition we are not going to have to do as much design work and sometimes the design work is what push the costs up , if you know what I mean .
21038	0	a	What does the cost look like Ron ?
21039	0	a	Is it cheaper to do the VR or to do the touch screen ?
21040	0	a	Nathan ?
21041	0	a	Right .
21042	0	a	Right .
21043	0	a	Right .
21044	0	a	And we are still not
21045	1	a	then we do not have to deal with this battery issue nearly as much either , we can stick with what we have already got .
21046	1	a	In a lot other ways too .
21047	0	a	Okay .
21048	0	a	So
21049	0	a	I am getting
21050	0	a	alright so
21051	0	a	more or less you guys think that o o of the two of them , the voice recognition will be better .
21052	0	a	Okay .
21053	0	a	I think it is our lower risk option which for right now we can have it on the market sooner
21054	0	a	which is all in all our best option .
21055	0	a	Yeah .
21056	0	a	Okay .
21057	0	a	Sorted .
21058	0	a	We will omit the touch screen in favour of voice recognition .
21059	0	a	It is you and me outside a little here .
21060	0	a	So
21061	0	a	and when are we going to have basic prototypes coming up next that is you guys is next step
21062	0	a	right ?
21063	0	a	Right .
21064	0	a	Yeah ,
21065	0	a	well
21066	1	a	we will we will sic we will sort out what it what f what else we are going to talk about for the prototype
21067	0	a	but yeah that is our next step , it will be a developing of prototype .
21068	0	a	Yeah .
21069	0	a	Okay .
21070	0	a	Are we going to talk now about the materials that we are going to use for the case and all those things ?
21071	0	a	Okay .
21072	0	a	Yes .
21073	0	a	We will just run through it
21074	0	a	yeah ,
21075	0	a	yeah , .
21076	0	a	You discussed either a lithium or a solar power .
21077	0	a	Would the solar power be enough to fuel a voice recognition ?
21078	0	a	Or this kinesthetic one , would that be enough to fuel a voice recognition remote control ?
21079	0	a	, the solar power definitely would be but I think just to keep people from getting annoyed , cause sometimes solar power fails and there is no way round that ,
21080	1	a	we should install a small backup battery .
21081	0	a	Yeah .
21082	0	a	Just to cover those moments when for whatever reason , the remote has not been exposed to
21083	0	a	It is true .
21084	0	a	Well
21085	1	a	what of people with like the TV in their basement ,
21086	0	a	like what if wha
21087	0	a	we ca not guarantee sunlight everywhere
21088	0	a	so having a secondary source is probably Yeah .
21089	0	a	Yep .
21090	0	a	Yeah ,
21091	0	a	it works about the same as a solar powered calculator , and you know how those those do not really require that much light , , but obviously a little more light than a calculator , but we are not talking about a lot of light .
21092	0	a	Calculator .
21093	0	a	True .
21094	0	a	True .
21095	0	a	Does not have to be out taking a sunbath for a few hours a day or anything .
21096	0	a	Right .
21097	0	a	Right .
21098	0	a	Okay .
21099	0	a	Okay .
21100	0	a	What do you think Ron ?
21101	0	a	Okay .
21102	0	a	I am willing to agree with everything that is been said .
21103	0	a	I have to say though that another idea is come up in my head .
21104	1	a	If we are really not handling the remote control to a great extent we could possibly get away from the idea of having a hand held remote control and maybe kind of have a round remote control that kind of looks like a paperweight or something like that ,
21105	1	a	kind of a sleek little neat thing that sits on your table or something .
21106	0	a	Interesting .
21107	0	a	Why , why moving away from hand held , why ?
21108	0	a	What is the idea ?
21109	0	a	Just a thought .
21110	0	a	Yeah .
21111	0	a	Well
21112	0	a	if you do not need to pick it up it could kind of be a selling point .
21113	0	a	I
21114	0	a	if it is got voice recognition it can be technically anywhere in your room and still do its job .
21115	0	a	Do you think people that are people that buy a remote , are they always going to want to use the voice recognition or is it just something that they do sometimes .
21116	0	a	True ,
21117	0	a	and i probabl
21118	1	a	I think we are banking on selling it to more than just voice recognition people , like we want it to work fundamentally as a basic manual too ,
21119	0	a	right .
21120	0	a	Well
21121	1	a	we have to have buttons on it too as well .
21122	0	a	But that is done , that is no bother
21123	0	a	I mean if you look at the catalogue from places like with sharper image or whatever you know they might have
21124	0	a	or like who is it ,
21125	0	a	Apple makes these really pretentious speakers with the th sub woofers you know like clear and glass
21126	0	a	and you know
21127	0	a	and then they got these little pyramidal type of speakers .
21128	0	a	Right .
21129	0	a	Yep .
21130	0	a	Yeah .
21131	1	a	I mean , why not have a little rounded kind of thing , it could still have the basic buttons on it .
21132	1	a	, cause we are going for basic functionality primarily as well .
21133	0	a	With the bu yeah .
21134	1	a	And maybe a menu button and so forth ,
21135	0	a	you know
21136	1	a	use a channel button to scroll through the menu
21137	1	a	d if they want to record programmes or whatever
21138	0	a	you know
21139	1	a	I mean we can sort that out .
21140	0	a	I think , I think you are on to something
21141	1	a	because we need to escape the traditional shape of a remote .
21142	0	a	Yeah .
21143	1	a	Maybe something that looks nice on a table is would be good , even though and hand held the same time .
21144	0	a	True .
21145	0	a	Way to go .
21146	0	a	I think it is all about following Apple is lead on a lot of these things .
21147	0	a	Yeah
21148	0	a	I am thinking of the airport portal ,
21149	0	a	you know like that little pod looking thing ?
21150	0	a	Right .
21151	0	a	Yeah ,
21152	0	a	those are nice .
21153	0	a	Exactly .
21154	0	a	Yeah ,
21155	0	a	I mean a nice although we do wh is
21156	0	a	I am recalling that she mentioned that we n need to get away from the surgical white kind of brushed aluminium thing and get back to it
21157	1	a	but you could have a very tasteful wood coloured or earth tone kind of
21158	0	a	Still , I mean , yeah , along those lines .
21159	0	a	That would be kind of neat .
21160	1	a	Terracotta bowl or something .
21161	0	a	Yeah I like that ,
21162	0	a	I like that idea a lot .
21163	1	a	, let is see what we can do as far as that goes .
21164	0	a	Okay .
21165	0	a	And the the material like the plastics and so forth , we were discussing that being using like a rubber kind of softer feel ,
21166	0	a	you know
21167	0	a	li lik
21168	0	a	if you feel the the tip on this pen it is a bit gives just a bit .
21169	0	a	Yeah .
21170	0	a	You know
21171	1	a	something where it is a a more advanced f form of plastic that has some kind of a tactile response to it .
21172	0	a	Right .
21173	1	a	Just kind of the squishy feel .
21174	0	a	Yeah ,
21175	0	a	which is the next big thing , so that is not going to hurt us either .
21176	0	a	kay .
21177	0	a	Yeah
21178	1	a	let is see if we can do a squishy non remote control looking remote control .
21179	0	a	But to be fair , yeah ,
21180	0	a	I mean , you just c you could just put it
21181	0	a	literally put it on the the ni the coffee table next to the telly and say volume up .
21182	0	a	Right .
21183	0	a	Yeah I like it ,
21184	0	a	I like the idea ,
21185	0	a	that is good .
21186	0	a	Handy .
21187	0	a	and we have sorted of discussed costs ,
21188	0	a	I guess we will a that is going to be a thing , if we run a bit over budget , that might be okay , .
21189	0	a	Sorry about the lack of information on cost ,
21190	0	a	I just have not been provided that information by our manufacturers and I am just having to guess .
21191	0	a	Okay .
21192	0	a	We will have more of an idea when the prototype have more of a
21193	0	a	we will have more of an idea later on .
21194	1	a	And we just yeah go from there .
21195	0	a	, so
21196	0	a	we have revisited the touch screen and more or less ruled that out ,
21197	0	a	, I think so we are more or less con
21198	0	a	we wh wh
21199	0	a	we are more or less in agreement that we want to have a a simple kind of function , you know , not too complex .
21200	0	a	Right .
21201	0	a	Well
21202	0	a	when the majority of people are only using the most primary functions on a daily basis ,
21203	1	a	although I am not saying we should completely rule out major functions , they should be secondary , at least if not functionally then visually , like those should not be Take precedence ,
21204	0	a	yeah .
21205	0	a	Right .
21206	1	a	Like maybe have menu things .
21207	1	a	If , if we are not going the touch screen route then we can just incorporate maybe something that folds out
21208	0	a	like what you often see on these kinds of remotes is the most basic functions up here and something that slides down to reveal the you know more complicated things .
21209	0	a	Right .
21210	0	a	And they slide .
21211	0	a	Yes .
21212	0	a	Well
21213	0	a	and do we want to consider like an iPod screen
21214	0	a	which is not a touch screen but you are still scrolling through menu options ,
21215	0	a	in p
21216	0	a	True ,
21217	0	a	we are still not making it easier then .
21218	0	a	Think then we are hitting our cost issue again .
21219	0	a	Yeah
21220	0	a	we have also got the the me the thing of ,
21221	0	a	if we are going to have a non remote looking remote
21222	0	a	, how do we yeah .
21223	0	a	Yeah .
21224	0	a	True .
21225	0	a	Fair enough .
21226	0	a	B
21227	0	a	But no
21228	0	a	I mean
21229	1	a	we could do a slide or a compartment ,
21230	0	a	you know ,
21231	0	a	like if it say it is a lit little vaguely ovoidal type of thing , it would be easy to have a compartment in there .
21232	0	a	Yeah .
21233	1	a	Or you know , a b a b a a series of you know three or four buttons with a menu button and then a side an s up and down type of thing , like on like on a DVD player .
21234	0	a	You know
21235	0	a	you see the modern DVD players will just have a menu button on the side and then four buttons around them and you can just kind of manoeuvre through the menu like that .
21236	0	a	Yeah
21237	0	a	it is just a scroll .
21238	0	a	Right .
21239	0	a	Yeah .
21240	0	a	So
21241	0	a	are we going to are we talking
21242	1	a	we need to figure out what kind of buttons we are going to use ,
21243	0	a	are we going to use scroll buttons ?
21244	0	a	Rubber buttons ?
21245	0	a	Right .
21246	0	a	Well
21247	0	a	it seems like
21248	0	a	I dunno
21249	1	a	it seems to me that we could just do the stick with the rubber
21250	0	a	cause since we are probably going to be using some kind of rubber for the outside case
21251	1	a	we might as well stick with that .
21252	0	a	Yeah .
21253	0	a	Probably .
21254	1	a	I think to a certain extent we have to stick with kind of a little bit traditional in terms of the buttons and then and then make our unique feature our casing and what not and our voice command .
21255	0	a	Right .
21256	0	a	Well no
21257	0	a	it is basic just like four directions that are that can use as menu or channel and volume or however you want to do it , are really versatile
21258	0	a	and everybody is already got them to some extent on the remotes they already own
21259	0	a	so it is not like we are dealing with everybody relearning things
21260	0	a	cause that is not something anybody is going to want to buy a new for .
21261	0	a	Right .
21262	0	a	kay , .
21263	0	a	We have already kind of covered this as well .
21264	0	a	That seems to be selling and we we have more or less agreed that we want to kar target this youth market , .
21265	0	a	Especially now with eighteen to thirty five year olds being such a large quantity of the population .
21266	0	a	Right ,
21267	0	a	particularly in technological fields , so that is exactly where we are headed .
21268	0	a	Okay .
21269	0	a	Yeah alright , well ,
21270	0	a	more or less covered what we need to cover I think
21271	0	a	fi an an
21272	1	a	any final thoughts before we think about doing the protot moving on to the prototype .
21273	0	a	Well what are we actually doing ?
21274	0	a	What were
21275	0	a	Sure .
21276	0	a	Right .
21277	1	a	I was just going to step on to
21278	0	a	I was not ?
21279	0	a	Oh ,
21280	0	a	my bad
21281	0	a	sorry .
21282	0	a	Oh
21283	0	a	it was not in the way
21284	0	a	but yeah , whatever .
21285	0	a	No , do not worry about it .
21286	0	a	The
21287	0	a	, yeah okay
21288	1	a	I was just going to assign tasks in the next
21289	0	a	b anyth any oth
21290	1	a	any other final thoughts before we go ahead and
21291	0	a	cool ?
21292	0	a	Okay .
21293	0	a	So
21294	0	a	have we decided that we are going to go with different style cases for different people ?
21295	0	a	Or are we just going to go with one ?
21296	0	a	.It is very , it is very hard thing to predict
21297	0	a	because you have different cases and that might open up your market a little bit obviously , but if you have just one case and it does not go very well .
21298	0	a	Yeah .
21299	0	a	Yeah .
21300	0	a	Yeah .
21301	0	a	Right .
21302	0	a	It is a tough situation ,
21303	0	a	but obviously having more cases also costs more
21304	0	a	so
21305	0	a	There is an idea .
21306	0	a	Well
21307	0	a	then again colours would not be so hard to do ,
21308	1	a	you could have a , you know , a kind of a natural wood colour , like a stained wood and , I do not know , olive green or something .
21309	0	a	Yeah .
21310	0	a	That would not be so much of a problem to incorporate into the colour of the thing .
21311	1	a	And again copying iMac is kind of for iPod Mac Apple is colour scheme .
21312	0	a	Yeah ,
21313	1	a	get in there .
21314	0	a	Yeah , totally .
21315	0	a	Yeah , I think that is probably a good
21316	0	a	id
21317	0	a	okay
21318	0	a	so
21319	1	a	let is work on multiple case colours .
21320	0	a	But yeah ,
21321	1	a	stick with the same kind of kind of
21322	1	a	yeah , the same basic non remote kind of remote design .
21323	0	a	Cool .
21324	0	a	Alright , so
21325	0	a	we will have the next meeting about half an hour , .
21326	0	a	I want the I would like
21327	1	a	Nathan , I would like you to work on just the basic look and feel , what can we accomplish , , given these parameters that we are just going to sort of have this kind of non remote remote .
21328	1	a	, what are our broad constraints before we deve design a prototype .
21329	0	a	Right .
21330	1	a	And Ron if you can figure out how probably best to lay out this idea of this simple design with the voice recognition built in and also this kind of drop down or s on the side kind of menu options simple .
21331	1	a	Somehow work out how we can get this all s in the same place .
21332	1	a	, and if you can check product evaluation with m some pilots and stuff .
21333	1	a	I need you guys to work together on making a prototype , using prototype building materials .
21334	0	a	And also specific instructions will be sent to you by your coaches as well .
21335	0	a	Oh excellent
21336	0	a	yeah .
21337	0	a	So that is what to start with for now ,
21338	0	a	is that alright ,
21339	0	a	you guys feel clear about this ?
21340	0	a	Alright .
21341	0	a	Cool .
21342	1	a	I guess we will just hit the bricks .
21343	0	a	 
21344	0	a	Okay .
21345	0	a	Oh
21346	0	a	I totally
21347	0	a	Yeah
21348	0	a	cause I moved it .
21349	1	a	Is put it over here .
21350	0	a	Then we do not have to worry about it .
21351	0	a	Ready for this ?
21352	0	a	Oh man .
21353	0	a	All set ?
21354	0	a	Cool .
21355	0	a	Alright ,
21356	1	a	it is PowerPoint time .
21357	0	a	I have done more PowerPoints in this particular experiment than I have ever done in my life before this experiment
21358	0	a	which is kind of fun .
21359	0	a	Yeah .
21360	0	a	So
21361	0	a	here we have our detailed design meeting where we will look at the prototype
21362	0	a	and
21363	0	a	right so ,
21364	0	a	I finally figured out what this whole second bullet point is about in my that my coach was sending to me .
21365	0	a	It means I am supposed to read the minutes from the previous meeting .
21366	0	a	Oh
21367	0	a	really ?
21368	0	a	Okay .
21369	0	a	I think .
21370	0	a	Huh .
21371	0	a	I do not know .
21372	0	a	Otherwise it is just saying I am the secretary and I am therefore I am taking the minutes ,
21373	0	a	s so just to go
21374	1	a	just real briefly to go over minutes from last meeting , , I will open them slowly , no ?
21375	1	a	Wait for it , wait for it .
21376	0	a	Yeah
21377	0	a	that is not you .
21378	0	a	No .
21379	0	a	That is how the
21380	1	a	Wait .
21381	0	a	This is , this is very high powered stuff here ,
21382	0	a	double clicking ,
21383	0	a	there we go .
21384	0	a	So
21385	0	a	basically the moral of the story from our last minute last meeting was that we that we had meetings from we had presentations done by the Industrial Designer , or from Nathan , and Ron and from Sarah about what we can do here and what sort of limitations we are operating with
21386	0	a	excuse me
21387	0	a	what limitations we are operating under , what kind of risk we would be looking at with some of the various approaches we were discussing and we essentially came to the conclusion that we should develop a remote with voice recognition , IE that had a vaguely non remote like shape because you did not really need to use it as a remote since you could just use your voice .
21388	0	a	That would include some mostly just the simple design features for a television operation but with a slide or a fold out bay for more advanced functions for users .
21389	0	a	, and the
21390	0	a	the UID and the ID were asked to go ahead and start developing a prototype for us to look at .
21391	0	a	So .
21392	0	a	That is sorted ,
21393	1	a	back to the main meet here , , go ahead and take it away guys .
21394	0	a	Well .
21395	0	a	we have assembled our prototype , .
21396	0	a	What is to be said about it ?
21397	0	a	, we took into account a lot of the things that we went over in the last meeting , .
21398	0	a	Some of the most important things to consider are that we decided not to go for the touch screen which you can see and opted for some very large buttons for the primary functions , .
21399	0	a	This is going to be the on off button and we have these buttons to go through the channels and then two volume buttons down here , d we decided those were the most important buttons .
21400	0	a	And then , for the more advanced functions there is a slide out panel here and you can see that there are lots of other things going on .
21401	0	a	But this actually can slide back in
21402	0	a	and provides a very nice aesthetic when it is all put away , .
21403	0	a	As far as the whole visible light thing , we decided to go with the multiple colours coming out ,
21404	0	a	why not ?
21405	0	a	Of course , if that is annoying for some people that function can be turned off .
21406	0	a	Nice .
21407	0	a	Fair enough .
21408	0	a	Perfect .
21409	0	a	No
21410	0	a	it is important to
21411	0	a	we talked a quite a bit about you know the the interchangeable faces and what we have done here is come up with a bit of a natural look here f we call it fruity
21412	0	a	if you will .
21413	1	a	Go ahead .
21414	0	a	Right .
21415	0	a	Appropriate , okay .
21416	0	a	Right , ,
21417	0	a	of course that is interchangeable
21418	1	a	and I think it would be desirable for the for the regular product in the in the in the in the first packaging to be something a little bit more subdued
21419	0	a	but this is kind of something that can be done and as you can see on the television there we have the voice detector device on the top there .
21420	0	a	kay .
21421	0	a	It is an option .
21422	0	a	Oh , right .
21423	0	a	That is this here .
21424	0	a	I see .
21425	0	a	So that that will work quite well with with regard to finding this contraption .
21426	0	a	, what other things do we see here , well ,
21427	0	a	if you give it a touch it does have actually a bit of a spongy feel ,
21428	0	a	, so
21429	0	a	I think that will work well with regards to our market .
21430	0	a	and
21431	1	a	let is see ,
21432	0	a	well
21433	1	a	clearly there is going to be some more colours and what not available .
21434	0	a	do you have anything else to add to that ?
21435	0	a	It is actually important to note that the television , you know if there is an earthquake or anything like that , that i it actually is edible inside .
21436	0	a	I worried about the materials ,
21437	0	a	it is
21438	0	a	the entire thing is covered in a rubber coating
21439	0	a	so it is very durable , it is not going to break like some types of plastic that is dropped .
21440	1	a	, and of course as you can see
21441	0	a	and if you touch it it does have that nice squishy feel .
21442	0	a	Fact ,
21443	1	a	I dunno if you noticed ,
21444	0	a	but I wrote the the company is name on the telephone screen ,
21445	0	a	I thought that was kind of nice .
21446	0	a	Oh
21447	0	a	well done
21448	0	a	yeah ,
21449	0	a	yeah
21450	0	a	oh ok
21451	0	a	Edible televisions , it is a wave of the future .
21452	0	a	Nice .
21453	0	a	This was actually an apple on the inside .
21454	0	a	Do we need to worry about rot factors ?
21455	0	a	Oh okay ,
21456	0	a	there is preservatives involved ,
21457	1	a	we do not need to worry ,
21458	0	a	okay .
21459	0	a	This
21460	0	a	Yeah .
21461	0	a	it is encased in a new type of polymer
21462	0	a	yeah .
21463	0	a	It is fine .
21464	0	a	We got a bit ahead of ourselves , I know we are not talking about making televisions at this point or anything like that , but
21465	0	a	Right .
21466	0	a	Fair enough .
21467	0	a	No
21468	0	a	but
21469	0	a	It is a couple years off at least .
21470	0	a	It is pos a possible new product .
21471	0	a	Okay .
21472	0	a	, but I think that is
21473	0	a	I think that sums up the main features of our of the remote ,
21474	0	a	I dunno if you guys have any questions
21475	0	a	or f whether that whether we need to worry about any other marketing areas or anything of that nature .
21476	0	a	Brilliant .
21477	0	a	, did we come in under budget ?
21478	0	a	we did , yeah .
21479	0	a	This cost
21480	0	a	well
21481	0	a	to put this into production , we are looking at about
21482	0	a	what was our goal ?
21483	0	a	It was twelve fifty Euro and this actually came in at about eleven ninety nine .
21484	0	a	, so I was quite pleased with that .
21485	0	a	One thing that we did not do
21486	0	a	obviously we had a choice with the buttons whether to use scroll buttons or standard rubber buttons , but we just went for a classic rubber button and since we did that we did not have to use as many microchips
21487	0	a	which was quite nice
21488	0	a	and that is what helped keep the cost down .
21489	0	a	Brilliant .
21490	0	a	So even though it has a lot of modern technology , for example the voice recognition , in a lot of ways it is just a simple remote
21491	1	a	and I think if we shopped around for other manufacturers we might be able to get even cheaper .
21492	0	a	Okay .
21493	0	a	Did we talk about the voice recognition option ?
21494	0	a	So so yeah
21495	0	a	on the back here you all noticed this area here which is actually the voice recognition console
21496	0	a	and I think it is nicely designed into the into the overall look .
21497	0	a	And
21498	0	a	Oh no , we have not talked about that yet have we ?
21499	0	a	Okay .
21500	0	a	Yeah .
21501	0	a	, but basically the voice recognition incorporates the latest designs that our research team has been able to cufw come up with .
21502	0	a	Basically quite similar to the coffee maker design that we were talking about earlier
21503	0	a	and , I think that has given a proven ease of use and what not .
21504	0	a	kay .
21505	0	a	Yeah .
21506	0	a	And allows features like the remote actually talking back to the user , so .
21507	0	a	Right .
21508	0	a	Cool .
21509	0	a	Any questions ?
21510	0	a	, do you want to answer this one or do you want me to answer it ?
21511	0	a	Yeah ,
21512	0	a	yeah .
21513	0	a	No , no
21514	0	a	I think that is
21515	0	a	Right , yeah
21516	0	a	thanks guys
21517	0	a	that is very , very good work .
21518	0	a	Do we have other , for lack of a better word , skins ?
21519	0	a	Covers ?
21520	0	a	In play now or are those ones going to be developed later once we see how the couple we have
21521	0	a	g go or ?
21522	1	a	Do we know where we stand on that yet ?
21523	0	a	Oh
21524	0	a	I was not expecting a prototype
21525	0	a	I just did not know if you guys had any in mind yet .
21526	0	a	Well
21527	0	a	we did not quite have enough material .
21528	0	a	Oh I see ,
21529	0	a	right , .
21530	0	a	, well
21531	0	a	as you can see this is just a most superficial layer
21532	0	a	and it would be very easy to put another layer of something else like
21533	0	a	It is not it is not quite a a face plate , it is more like a pseudo face plate
21534	0	a	because it is simple enough
21535	0	a	that in the factory it could we could very easily put a different one on it , it locks into place such that , you know , it is pretty permanent
21536	1	a	but at the same time , if we want to go the other way it is just a matter of a couple of adjustments and we could go the face plate way
21537	0	a	if you know what I mean .
21538	0	a	Okay .
21539	0	a	Just veneer really ,
21540	0	a	yeah .
21541	0	a	Right .
21542	0	a	Okay .
21543	0	a	Actually this bottom red ring here just unclips and then you put a a new a new a new plate on top of that .
21544	0	a	And the whole thing
21545	0	a	Okay
21546	0	a	Right
21547	0	a	So
21548	0	a	I mean there are I
21549	0	a	we definitely priced out a spongy even spongier non natural look materials
21550	0	a	which I think worked out fine .
21551	0	a	Yeah .
21552	0	a	There is
21553	0	a	Okay .
21554	0	a	We also continued on with the ideas that f following Apple is colour schemes with the kind of the light orange and the green .
21555	0	a	kay .
21556	0	a	Okay , very cool .
21557	0	a	Okay .
21558	0	a	Okay .
21559	0	a	Yep .
21560	0	a	It is still an option if we need it .
21561	0	a	Yeah .
21562	0	a	Very cool , nice job .
21563	0	a	I like it , brilliant .
21564	1	a	, what we need to discuss now is the finance of it ,
21565	0	a	I got me you have got
21566	0	a	you provided a number
21567	0	a	that actually sounds quite nice .
21568	0	a	the trouble is I was just given this by finance .
21569	0	a	Oh .
21570	0	a	, it is a spreadsheet of the parts
21571	0	a	and I have just tentatively put in what it is going to look like .
21572	0	a	Ooh .
21573	1	a	I am just going to clear this out real quickly ,
21574	0	a	but it looks like
21575	0	a	So
21576	0	a	we will just
21577	1	a	if we can just itemize what is in here ,
21578	0	a	we have got this
21579	0	a	it is a solar cell thing
21580	0	a	right ?
21581	0	a	With a back up battery ?
21582	0	a	With the ba okay .
21583	0	a	Right
21584	0	a	we did not really touch on that
21585	0	a	but it
21586	0	a	it is in there ,
21587	0	a	yep .
21588	0	a	and
21589	0	a	Clever , clever , well done .
21590	0	a	The voice recognition area actually doubles as as the solar cell area .
21591	0	a	Yeah .
21592	0	a	so I guess that would mean we have got a bit of a
21593	0	a	It is a s a speaker and a sensor at the same time
21594	0	a	is not it ?
21595	0	a	Okay .
21596	0	a	Yeah ,
21597	0	a	yeah .
21598	0	a	It is just making use of the same space and the same materials ,
21599	0	a	Yeah ,
21600	0	a	one big curve I guess you could say .
21601	0	a	and the case , it is more of a single curved case ,
21602	0	a	I guess would be that be the general
21603	0	a	and we have got a rubber skin material basically throughout .
21604	0	a	Push button interface with this other drop down
21605	0	a	so maybe we have got two push button interfaces
21606	0	a	do not we ?
21607	0	a	Yeah , .
21608	0	a	And a special
21609	0	a	I guess it is we have got a sort of a wood materi a rubbery type material that throughout ,
21610	0	a	yeah .
21611	0	a	Yeah ,
21612	0	a	special .
21613	1	a	And s I guess you have to mark special colour and special form as well ,
21614	0	a	do not you ?
21615	0	a	Cause it
21616	0	a	i
21617	0	a	it is very unconventional , I like to think of it as unconventional .
21618	0	a	Yeah , it is it is quite unique .
21619	0	a	I like it , yeah
21620	0	a	it is
21621	0	a	So
21622	0	a	it looks like a bit over budget , .
21623	0	a	M come in at sixteen ?
21624	0	a	Yeah .
21625	0	a	Oh .
21626	0	a	Huh ,
21627	0	a	does not match up
21628	0	a	does it ?
21629	0	a	How do you feel about that ?
21630	1	a	I mean we could take we could take the battery out of it
21631	1	a	you see
21632	0	a	and it would probably work ninety nine per cent of the time
21633	1	a	but you are going to have to set up a call centre for that one per cent of the time
21634	0	a	when people are calling and saying oh look my remote is not working
21635	1	a	what am I going to do ?
21636	0	a	People would be real upset .
21637	0	a	So
21638	1	a	what we could do perhaps , a simple fix would maybe to switch away from the solar cells or take out the back up battery .
21639	0	a	I mean
21640	0	a	I think that if we are talking about it being one of our main selling features , being environmental and without the batteries and what not , although it does still have a battery
21641	0	a	so I am not sure that you know what the sell is on that .
21642	0	a	k .
21643	0	a	I think in the long run it is better to keep the battery , it is hard to scrap the whole cell battery idea
21644	0	a	cause that is so integral to the theme that we have .
21645	0	a	True .
21646	0	a	What is difficult , we have all these things integral to the to the design of it that we just ca not back out of now ,
21647	0	a	it would have to be
21648	1	a	seems like we would have to go back to square one in a way .
21649	0	a	Nah .
21650	1	a	if we were going to try to undo one bit we would probably have to undo most of it , It is either or .
21651	0	a	Yeah .
21652	0	a	Although we do not want to get rid of the whole environmental
21653	0	a	I mean obviously the solar cell is a big piece of the way we are marketing this as like a natural , new thing ,
21654	1	a	but honestly if we cut that one piece out we are actually coming in under budget
21655	0	a	if I have done my math correctly .
21656	0	a	I mean you might be able to sway me on the idea that we our main selling point could be already this voice recognition thing
21657	0	a	I mean that is what sets us apart
21658	0	a	right ?
21659	0	a	And the reality is you know , for me from an ideological stand point , I would like to stick with the the solar cell ,
21660	1	a	but I h kind of have to throw myself in the in the business structure model here
21661	1	a	and you know I think I think that I think that we need to come to a compromise here and maybe move ahead with the project , without the solar cell .
21662	0	a	I mean Which , it is
21663	0	a	yeah
21664	0	a	that is what setting us into this young market , I mean that is where we started from , so
21665	0	a	I do not know ,
21666	0	a	and I mean you know
21667	1	a	perhaps when the cell technology comes down in price we can bring that back into the game
21668	0	a	but it looks like at this point that may be out of our league .
21669	0	a	Right .
21670	0	a	Right .
21671	0	a	Yeah .
21672	0	a	Right .
21673	0	a	Yeah .
21674	0	a	Yeah .
21675	0	a	I think unfortunately that is our best option .
21676	0	a	I guess we might have to do that .
21677	0	a	It is the only way we are going to get below our goal
21678	0	a	is not it ?
21679	0	a	Of twelve fifty .
21680	1	a	Cause we ca not remove the push buttons
21681	0	a	cause they are
21682	0	a	and we ca not get rid of the I mean removing the
21683	0	a	changing the case would not be so much of a mm mm , , nor would changing the case materials .
21684	0	a	Yeah , .
21685	0	a	It kind of
21686	0	a	yeah .
21687	0	a	Savings .
21688	0	a	Mm mm .
21689	0	a	So yeah
21690	0	a	that looks like to be the only thing .
21691	0	a	Yeah .
21692	0	a	So that would be the
21693	0	a	it is a major change but
21694	0	a	Yeah .
21695	0	a	Gotta do what you gotta do .
21696	0	a	Alright , so
21697	0	a	we are in agreement on that .
21698	0	a	Unfortunately I think we are .
21699	0	a	No ,
21700	0	a	I think that was a good compromise you brought forward Sarah .
21701	0	a	Right .
21702	1	a	Moving along swiftly .
21703	0	a	, so
21704	1	a	I guess now we just go to the project evaluation which I will allow Sarah to take over .
21705	0	a	That would be me .
21706	1	a	cord ?
21707	0	a	No problem .
21708	0	a	of course ,
21709	0	a	sorry .
21710	0	a	Whoosh .
21711	1	a	Can you reach ,
21712	0	a	that would be great ,
21713	0	a	thank you .
21714	0	a	Yep .
21715	0	a	That would be great
21716	0	a	Brilliant .
21717	0	a	I did not even do that one on purpose either ,
21718	0	a	damn .
21719	0	a	Okay , ,
21720	0	a	basically I was just evaluating from what we know of how our product is working right now with the criteria that we set at the beginning of these are the things we needed to do , these are the things that look like we feel they are important .
21721	0	a	so I was looking at basic design things ,
21722	0	a	does it fulfil its functions as a remote ?
21723	0	a	Is the design what we wanted it to do ?
21724	0	a	I
21725	0	a	are technologies up to where we hoped they would be and does it fulfil the aesthetic qualities that our original market research was looking for ? .
21726	0	a	Basic questions like , you know , does it turn on ?
21727	0	a	Does it respond to voice recognition ?
21728	0	a	And overall , in general , it looks like it is coming up to par .
21729	0	a	, the only thing is with with the pull out panel , that is , can it take some adjusting
21730	0	a	because it is a new sort of interface ,
21731	0	a	that looked like it was coming up rough , but then , once you get used to it , it does make a lot of sense .
21732	0	a	So I think overall we are headed in the right direction .
21733	0	a	Really good .
21734	0	a	So .
21735	0	a	They like that spongy feel .
21736	0	a	Yeah .
21737	0	a	It looks like it is going over well , so
21738	0	a	we are we are good
21739	0	a	yeah .
21740	0	a	And the paging function works well , that is good to hear ,
21741	0	a	we worked hard on that one .
21742	0	a	Six ?
21743	0	a	We did .
21744	0	a	Yeah .
21745	0	a	It is
21746	0	a	I think eventually if we do branch out with this product maybe we do have a higher budget options
21747	1	a	and if it goes over with this model we can look into wider range voice recognition like from other rooms of the house and stuff ,
21748	0	a	but for now , what we have got is working in the range
21749	0	a	we need it for ,
21750	0	a	so
21751	0	a	it is all good .
21752	0	a	I am bit disappointed about losing the solar panel but it is okay .
21753	0	a	That is everything from me .
21754	0	a	Yeah .
21755	0	a	Yeah , it is a set back ,
21756	0	a	but
21757	0	a	Okay ,
21758	0	a	do you need the cord back ?
21759	0	a	As in within the team or ?
21760	0	a	Okay .
21761	0	a	W we might have we might have lost that granola market again
21762	0	a	that we are
21763	0	a	I guess that is true .
21764	0	a	yeah ,
21765	0	a	I was just
21766	1	a	go on .
21767	0	a	I know .
21768	0	a	Well
21769	0	a	they do not own tellys anyway
21770	0	a	do they ?
21771	0	a	Right .
21772	0	a	True .
21773	0	a	So , ,
21774	0	a	this one is a bit unclear to me to be perfectly fair , .
21775	0	a	I got this slide from the coach and I am not sure what it is connected to .
21776	1	a	so I guess we are going to discuss our project process
21777	1	a	and that is going to go into my report .
21778	0	a	So
21779	1	a	I guess this is the point where we go out of role it looks like and talk about our satisfaction for room for creativity and so forth and how that all worked , I guess , .
21780	0	a	Okay .
21781	0	a	I think so
21782	0	a	yeah .
21783	0	a	Right so
21784	0	a	it is just kind of a open mic kind of thing or
21785	0	a	Kay .
21786	0	a	I think it is I
21787	0	a	, I think so .
21788	0	a	I think hope I am not screwing up an experiment .
21789	0	a	It is now , you are in charge
21790	0	a	so
21791	0	a	there you go .
21792	0	a	But I trust that she would jump in if I was
21793	0	a	so okay
21794	0	a	fair enough .
21795	0	a	Yeah .
21796	0	a	Whatever .
21797	0	a	right , so
21798	0	a	any thoughts ?
21799	0	a	Yeah .
21800	0	a	Are we considering these points here ?
21801	0	a	Okay .
21802	0	a	I think they are starting blocks
21803	0	a	yeah .
21804	0	a	What do you guys feel about the process ?
21805	0	a	, you know
21806	0	a	I think in general , for a day is worth of work we actually were relatively productive ,
21807	0	a	considering the little amount of input we had going in .
21808	0	a	, and the technology has definitely been a help , it is really been interesting to try out all this new stuff .
21809	0	a	We did not use the whiteboard at all .
21810	0	a	No .
21811	0	a	No , no whiteboard .
21812	0	a	No , we did not .
21813	1	a	We could now if that would make up for it
21814	0	a	but really
21815	0	a	and I feel like if you guys had been designing in here perhaps that would have changed
21816	0	a	but because of room constraints , does not really matter .
21817	0	a	And
21818	0	a	, also had I not been intrigued about the pen , I do not think I woulda used it at all , I did not write barely anything .
21819	0	a	Yeah
21820	0	a	I think I was taking notes more often than usual
21821	0	a	just cause I liked the pen , yeah .
21822	0	a	Yeah , it is true .
21823	0	a	Was pretty cool tack though .
21824	0	a	Yeah .
21825	0	a	Definitely .
21826	0	a	I am disappointed I did not get a note back from my personal coach .
21827	0	a	As you write your personal coach .
21828	0	a	Yeah , but I did not get a response
21829	0	a	so
21830	0	a	we will see .
21831	0	a	What if you get a response two or three months from now ?
21832	0	a	That would be weird .
21833	0	a	Okay
21834	0	a	that would be kind of creepy .
21835	0	a	Attempts to contact coach ineffective .
21836	0	a	Well
21837	0	a	what kind of coaching is that really ?
21838	0	a	What if I really needed something .
21839	0	a	I so
21840	0	a	I do not
21841	0	a	n I think there was a lot of room for creativity ,
21842	0	a	we could do whatever basically what we wanted until the budget came down on us , .
21843	0	a	I think so .
21844	0	a	And even then we did get a decent product turned out although it is not everything we wanted it to be .
21845	0	a	Yeah .
21846	0	a	With the natural look .
21847	0	a	That is very natural .
21848	0	a	Very natural look .
21849	0	a	Organic , really .
21850	0	a	That is the brilliance of they had a p they had a peeler in here .
21851	0	a	And highly resourceful team mates might I add
21852	0	a	which is always a plus .
21853	0	a	Yeah .
21854	0	a	Yeah , I think , yeah
21855	0	a	re I thought it was like really creative actually , I mean .
21856	0	a	yeah , I am impressed .
21857	0	a	I think the teamwork was good as well .
21858	0	a	And to prove that we were not wasteful we did not waste a single bit of Play Doh , we used every bit .
21859	0	a	Nice .
21860	0	a	All four of those little containers .
21861	0	a	Yeah ,
21862	0	a	I guess
21863	0	a	My one my one criticism is that we did not have enough colours to work with ,
21864	0	a	we only had four ,
21865	0	a	was not enough .
21866	0	a	Including the s the multi coloured wave pattern .
21867	0	a	Yeah .
21868	0	a	You could have developed multiple skins really had you had more colours .
21869	0	a	I know it could have been amazing .
21870	0	a	Oh well .
21871	0	a	What did you guys think about the the the roles ?
21872	0	a	That is true ,
21873	0	a	I
21874	0	a	I got this spreadsheet .
21875	0	a	They were good .
21876	0	a	Yeah it is f kind of fun ,
21877	0	a	it was
21878	0	a	I think it was pretty clever
21879	0	a	cause we were never able to get too far off track because the information came in at the right time and kind of filled in the gaps enough .
21880	0	a	Yeah .
21881	0	a	True .
21882	0	a	At the same time you had enough room to kind of just make things up ,
21883	0	a	which was kind of fun .
21884	0	a	Do your own .
21885	0	a	Though I did feel like th the level of information dropped off severely over the course of the day .
21886	0	a	Yeah .
21887	0	a	I mean maybe it is just me
21888	0	a	but I did not actually get any information for the last presentation at all .
21889	0	a	Nothing , I did not even get an email ,
21890	0	a	like
21891	0	a	that was it .
21892	0	a	So , yeah ,
21893	0	a	I feel like that was slightly lacking
21894	0	a	but then you know , fill in the blanks on your own , level of creativity upped .
21895	0	a	Well
21896	0	a	I think that was
21897	0	a	I think that was an issue I kept finding with regard to
21898	0	a	well
21899	0	a	no
21900	0	a	but also
21901	0	a	yeah
21902	0	a	when I was reporting about what each of us was doing I was often confused as to what you were doing
21903	0	a	and then I also felt like you know a lot of our discussion would centre around n specifically what my task was because that was kind of the interface portion which was what the whole project was about
21904	0	a	but
21905	0	a	and then in the end I think our jobs kind of melded together a little bit more ,
21906	0	a	which was fine .
21907	0	a	Whatever .
21908	0	a	Of what to do .
21909	0	a	Uh huh ,
21910	0	a	that was not very much .
21911	0	a	You know
21912	0	a	Yeah .
21913	0	a	Yes .
21914	0	a	very much so .
21915	0	a	Yeah .
21916	0	a	That was fun .
21917	0	a	I think the most helpful thing out of everything was getting the the PowerPoint slides already put together for you
21918	0	a	cause if we did not have that there is no way we could have got all that done in time .
21919	0	a	Yeah , already having the formatted stuff helped a lot .
21920	0	a	Very much so .
21921	0	a	Cool .
21922	0	a	And I think your leadership was quite good .
21923	0	a	It was really good
21924	0	a	yeah .
21925	0	a	She said I I I
21926	0	a	she actually made a comment off boy you are getting into this
21927	0	a	and I really I think it is true
21928	0	a	I did get
21929	0	a	I
21930	0	a	I felt like I got way too into it .
21931	0	a	Yeah .
21932	0	a	That is kind of a good thing though ,
21933	0	a	you know ,
21934	0	a	give the rest of us some structure to work with
21935	0	a	so hey .
21936	0	a	I felt like I slipped into it a lot .
21937	0	a	It is kind of fun .
21938	0	a	I dunno .
21939	0	a	An
21940	0	a	so
21941	0	a	is that the first time you have taken on that kind of role ?
21942	0	a	I had to admit , as soon as w we started I mean as soon as we got the Play Doh , th you know the whole concept of really trying to stick with reality went out the window .
21943	0	a	The first time I have ever done anything like yeah project project management .
21944	0	a	I usually organise crap , it is one thing to do ,
21945	0	a	you know set up a party with your friends ,
21946	0	a	you know ?
21947	0	a	But you guys felt that you could keep the , yeah , suspension of disbelief kind of like like the role and the okay ?
21948	0	a	Yeah ,
21949	0	a	yeah .
21950	0	a	Yeah .
21951	0	a	Yeah .
21952	0	a	Little different .
21953	0	a	Yeah .
21954	0	a	Yeah .
21955	0	a	I
21956	0	a	except for a couple moments where it just got out of hand
21957	0	a	and I knew we were all lying through our teeth , other than that
21958	0	a	I could only imagine .
21959	0	a	Yeah .
21960	1	a	Maybe in in Legos you know ?
21961	1	a	Be fun with Legos too , like make a remote control or spaceship ,
21962	0	a	we used to have spaceship Legos
21963	0	a	did you guys ever used to build spaceships with Legos
21964	0	a	everybody knows best spaceships ever .
21965	0	a	Possibly .
21966	0	a	Oh yeah , still have them .
21967	0	a	Yeah .
21968	0	a	Totally .
21969	0	a	you guys felt like there was enough teamwork in all ?
21970	0	a	Yeah ?
21971	0	a	You do not .
21972	0	a	I think so .
21973	0	a	Yep .
21974	0	a	No I , no I dunno ,
21975	0	a	I d
21976	0	a	I I dunno ,
21977	0	a	I do not I
21978	0	a	I was just I
21979	0	a	It is true huh ?
21980	0	a	Yeah .
21981	0	a	Though we did not actually
21982	0	a	I mean other than minor discussion at meetings there was not except for the actual building ,
21983	0	a	but I feel like if this was a team project there actually would have been much more of the collaborative like brainstorming , use the board
21984	0	a	well
21985	0	a	and this would have been six months' worth of work , not like three hours' worth of meetings .
21986	0	a	Yeah .
21987	0	a	I mean
21988	0	a	I think had the issue been more serious we probably woulda brainstormed more during our meetings as a team .
21989	0	a	Yeah .
21990	0	a	That is true .
21991	0	a	Yeah .
21992	0	a	Course I am I am conscious of the idea of the Project Manager asking if you guys feel like there is a team you know
21993	0	a	it is like , kind of like , like .
21994	0	a	It d
21995	0	a	But yeah .
21996	0	a	Yeah that is kind of
21997	0	a	Mine was the mics .
21998	0	a	Interesting .
21999	0	a	It is kind of fascinating
22000	0	a	was not it ?
22001	0	a	I mean the whole process of I do not know .
22002	0	a	Wonder why
22003	0	a	is there anything about the way that we got so much inform what was it
22004	0	a	that kept us from going to the the board ?
22005	0	a	Yeah , that is it
22006	0	a	cause the mics are loose and each time you get up it is s a possibility of tripping over something or getting tangled or .
22007	0	a	I I do not know if there was a ri
22008	0	a	I th
22009	0	a	I did not feel like getting up and down and dealing with all these wires , I was afraid I was going to break something actually .
22010	0	a	Yeah .
22011	0	a	Yeah .
22012	0	a	Yeah .
22013	0	a	Well
22014	0	a	I dunno what I woulda shown on that board .
22015	0	a	True ,
22016	0	a	but it did not even occur to me as an option ,
22017	0	a	I mean I do not know that I would have
22018	0	a	but I know that I consciously did not .
22019	0	a	Nor I .
22020	0	a	I mean
22021	0	a	it is just like the paper
22022	0	a	I do not know what I really needed the paper for .
22023	0	a	True .
22024	0	a	, because I have got this laptop .
22025	0	a	Yeah .
22026	0	a	Standard , I just used it cause it is literally right in front of me .
22027	0	a	Yeah .
22028	0	a	I want to see the output files from these , from the digital paper .
22029	0	a	Well
22030	0	a	it looks really professional .
22031	0	a	I want to see wh wh what my my handwriting looks like digitized because my handwriting is crap .
22032	0	a	I know .
22033	0	a	Yeah ,
22034	0	a	that is it .
22035	0	a	I mean ,
22036	0	a	just to see what it looks like in PDF format or something .
22037	0	a	Usually I would do a lot more doodling too
22038	0	a	but I did not
22039	0	a	because
22040	0	a	New ideas .
22041	0	a	I know ,
22042	0	a	I felt like I needed to be professional
22043	0	a	so I did not like draw all over my paper and stuff .
22044	0	a	Okay , well
22045	0	a	not entirely ,
22046	0	a	but still , I doodled less than I usually do .
22047	0	a	T
22048	0	a	I I am curious about what the de briefing is going to be like .
22049	0	a	You know , like
22050	0	a	what is the
22051	0	a	what exactly we are looking for here .
22052	0	a	So
22053	0	a	is this all we need to get through ?
22054	0	a	Is it
22055	1	a	Any new ideas with regard to remote control concepts ?
22056	0	a	What is that ?
22057	0	a	Our limited ability to think outside the box ?
22058	0	a	Why ?
22059	0	a	Huh
22060	0	a	I think it was the real .
22061	0	a	I dunno , I am not sure what the new ideas found i is about .
22062	0	a	I guess .
22063	0	a	It did it just say in an email that we need to discuss that ?
22064	0	a	That slide was like that ?
22065	0	a	Well .
22066	0	a	Well ,
22067	0	a	that is the thing I got i in the email
22068	0	a	I got this PowerPoint file but this slide was just there , .
22069	0	a	I did not change this one at all .
22070	0	a	ch
22071	0	a	Yeah well .
22072	0	a	I guess we are on the right track .
22073	0	a	W I kind of like th
22074	0	a	Yeah
22075	0	a	you ca not
22076	0	a	Yeah .
22077	0	a	No , none .
22078	0	a	I think they still do their job .
22079	0	a	I think they are fine actually .
22080	0	a	I am thinking outside the little square box though , with literally in like form
22081	0	a	I do not
22082	0	a	Yeah .
22083	0	a	Yeah ,
22084	1	a	maybe a s a circle would be alright , different .
22085	0	a	Does kind of make you wonder ,
22086	0	a	I mean ,
22087	0	a	how much can you do with a remote control ?
22088	0	a	It is like inventing a new car .
22089	0	a	Yeah yeah ,
22090	0	a	you can
22091	0	a	Yeah .
22092	1	a	It is still gotta be technically car shaped
22093	0	a	or it wo not fit on the road ,
22094	0	a	you know ?
22095	0	a	Do not know .
22096	0	a	Kay .
22097	0	a	Kind of .
22098	0	a	So this was other costs .
22099	0	a	Are we back into project mood ?
22100	0	a	Yeah .
22101	0	a	I dunno .
22102	0	a	I think this is
22103	0	a	forty ish
22104	1	a	I I
22105	1	a	I
22106	1	a	we should go on a bit
22107	1	a	yeah
22108	1	a	about the project eval , .
22109	0	a	Oh ,
22110	0	a	how long was our meeting supposed to be ?
22111	0	a	How much time do we have left ?
22112	0	a	I dunno about you guys
22113	0	a	but I felt like a bit under stimulated on the whole thing .
22114	0	a	Like ,
22115	1	a	what like you know what am I really doing ,
22116	0	a	you know
22117	0	a	what is
22118	0	a	Yep .
22119	0	a	Yeah ,
22120	0	a	at the beginning it started out and I felt actually like under pressure like the first couple were taking a lot of work
22121	0	a	and I was like had like all this brainstorming I was doing
22122	0	a	and then suddenly I was like
22123	0	a	well it is just another two minute presentation that you guys do not really care about anyway so type away .
22124	0	a	Hey .
22125	0	a	You know , you know what I mean like we all sort of knew where we were headed with it
22126	0	a	so it did not feel like it mattered anymore .
22127	0	a	Yeah .
22128	0	a	Yeah .
22129	0	a	Definitely when when I first filled out the questionnaire I was marking it probably higher in terms of how much I had to how much I stressed over it and then by the time I got to the last one I was like , you know , not very much .
22130	0	a	Whatever .
22131	0	a	Yeah .
22132	0	a	Think it was also realisation of you basically just copy and paste what is given to you into your presentation which was not so clear to me at the beginning .
22133	0	a	Yeah .
22134	0	a	Very much
22135	0	a	, yeah .
22136	0	a	I actually did not do that at all though , every single one
22137	0	a	I a all the presentations I either added slides or edited them .
22138	0	a	I di
22139	0	a	Oh .
22140	0	a	Oh
22141	0	a	I added like five slides too ,
22142	0	a	but I
22143	0	a	Yeah , mine too .
22144	0	a	See
22145	0	a	I only got blank ones .
22146	0	a	Did you really ?
22147	0	a	I just got blank ones
22148	0	a	and
22149	0	a	Me too .
22150	0	a	What ?
22151	0	a	Really ?
22152	0	a	Did they not have they did not like mine
22153	0	a	yeah
22154	0	a	they did not come like this ?
22155	0	a	Like with
22156	0	a	this was what it looks like .
22157	0	a	My slides were all blank , they would have a title maybe and they were just empty .
22158	0	a	Like with those words already on it ?
22159	0	a	No .
22160	0	a	This is what that looked like , literally , just like that .
22161	0	a	No .
22162	0	a	Interesting .
22163	0	a	I wondered why yours always looked so more complicated .
22164	0	a	Uh huh huh huh .
22165	0	a	I deleted slides .
22166	0	a	I think I added a slide one time .
22167	0	a	I added many slides every time
22168	0	a	Yeah .
22169	0	a	Hey
22170	0	a	with the whole new background being innovative , yeah that was class .
22171	0	a	That was pretty cool , it was a high moment of the whole experiment .
22172	0	a	Interesting .
22173	0	a	Any other thoughts come to mind ?
22174	0	a	Yeah
22175	0	a	but
22176	0	a	Builds .
22177	0	a	I want to know how our product would fare .
22178	0	a	I ca not just leave it there .
22179	0	a	I think it would fail , I think it would be a huge disaster , especially if it looks like that .
22180	0	a	I think it would take extensive marketing ,
22181	0	a	okay , an apple with a red button on top , even I am sceptical .
22182	0	a	But you know the whole
22183	0	a	Yeah .
22184	0	a	Even you .
22185	0	a	I do not
22186	0	a	we kind of designed it to look little bit like a face .
22187	0	a	I know it is .
22188	0	a	It is a happy face .
22189	0	a	Actually that looked a lot more like a tongue from previous to fr some other design modifications .
22190	0	a	I hope you appreciate the incorporation of some tin foil from a random Kit Kat bar
22191	0	a	that happened to be consumed .
22192	0	a	I I noticed that .
22193	0	a	By accident .
22194	0	a	Interesting .
22195	0	a	Well huh .
22196	0	a	An interesting day all in all I would say .
22197	0	a	, yeah , I would say so .
22198	0	a	Yeah ,
22199	0	a	it is I want to see a
22200	0	a	Yeah .
22201	0	a	So
22202	0	a	again I reiterate my question
22203	0	a	of how different we are comp compared to the other groups , especially between culture groups and what not .
22204	0	a	I know .
22205	0	a	, I know .
22206	0	a	It seemed like everything flowed pretty logically .
22207	0	a	I
22208	0	a	Yeah .
22209	0	a	You know from the the the basics to the conce
22210	0	a	although the whole concepts thing , the whole concepts phase , I do not think I really understood like the concept .
22211	0	a	Well
22212	0	a	the id
22213	0	a	okay
22214	0	a	the notion of
22215	0	a	yeah
22216	0	a	I mean
22217	0	a	i it is not like I have a concept of a mug is material , it is just it is what it is .
22218	0	a	Cause it is such a functional item .
22219	0	a	You know ,
22220	0	a	maybe i rather than concepts i
22221	0	a	it should be th thought of we sh
22222	0	a	I
22223	0	a	I thought of
22224	0	a	I thought of
22225	0	a	rather than in terms of concepts I thought of it in terms of proposed idea .
22226	0	a	And then the final would be like th the actual specified prototype or whatever ,
22227	0	a	I dunno .
22228	0	a	But .
22229	0	a	All in all it is kind of interesting .
22230	0	a	So
22231	0	a	we have more slides or ?
22232	0	a	No just this closing one .
22233	0	a	No
22234	0	a	we have established that the costs were not really within budget , but we could s
22235	0	a	you know do it
22236	0	a	We did the project evaluation based on Sarah
22237	0	a	is evaluation of on off switches
22238	0	a	and
22239	0	a	We got it to be .
22240	0	a	Like cutting corners .
22241	0	a	Kind of , though it was really technically an evaluation of the product , not the project in general .
22242	0	a	Which I am not sure is the same thing , at the time that just i made more sense , but I could see if they were really asking about us .
22243	0	a	True .
22244	0	a	Yeah .
22245	0	a	Cause we di we had a thu think about it .
22246	0	a	Yeah .
22247	0	a	And it is all recorded ,
22248	0	a	woo hoo .
22249	0	a	Yeah
22250	0	a	what I am going to
22251	0	a	I am going to put
22252	0	a	I am supposed to do this final report thing at the end
22253	1	a	so I will put all that into the final report as well , or as much as seems like maybe not like the articles and stuff , like because and if and so forth , but I will put most of it in the reports .
22254	0	a	Yay .
22255	0	a	I
22256	0	a	It would be so cool if we get a copy of the recording .
22257	1	a	Make it sound eloquent .
22258	0	a	Oh , I have to done
22259	0	a	I have
22260	0	a	I have done transcription before
22261	0	a	and it is really ridiculous how many words people say like just in the middle of their sentences like that
22262	0	a	that mean nothing .
22263	0	a	Nice .
22264	0	a	Oh yeah .
22265	0	a	There is a whole branch of psychology that looks into that , psycholinguistics .
22266	0	a	What the uhs and the
22267	0	a	Really .
22268	0	a	There is a guy studying it here , yeah , he is studying ums and ahs or something .
22269	0	a	Filler words or ?
22270	0	a	Disfluencies .
22271	0	a	Yep , they are called disfluencies .
22272	0	a	That is a good word for it .
22273	0	a	Yeah
22274	0	a	we like our fancy phrases and terminologies for things .
22275	1	a	Just add some prefixes ,
22276	0	a	sounds classier .
22277	0	a	Exactly
22278	1	a	I will save this into the project documents .
22279	0	a	I find myself hitting the send and receive button on the email a lot , just out of boredom ,
22280	1	a	like c come on gimme something .
22281	0	a	I ,
22282	0	a	yeah ,
22283	0	a	pretty compulsively during meetings , like ,
22284	0	a	yeah .
22285	0	a	Yeah .
22286	0	a	Oh yeah .
22287	0	a	Yeah I know .
22288	1	a	Come on give me some information .
22289	0	a	Well
22290	0	a	to be fair we are we are hooked
22291	0	a	we are all hooked on the internet ,
22292	0	a	so I mean I do the
22293	0	a	I know ,
22294	0	a	imagine we went the first ten y fifteen years of our lives without the internet .
22295	0	a	Yeah ,
22296	0	a	we are addicts .
22297	0	a	That is scary
22298	0	a	yeah ?
22299	0	a	Well
22300	0	a	just around that eight or or nine people that are
22301	0	a	Dude , I think we have had internet for like eighteen years .
22302	0	a	It is scary .
22303	0	a	It is only in the last ten that we are like where is the internet ?
22304	0	a	I mean , you know ,
22305	0	a	it just in the past five we have gone from twenty eight eight modems to broadband all the time .
22306	0	a	Yeah .
22307	0	a	I yeah .
22308	0	a	True .
22309	0	a	No
22310	0	a	we have but I not in the sense that it is so un you know ubiquitous
22311	0	a	I yeah .
22312	0	a	Yeah .
22313	0	a	But it is not regular
22314	0	a	I mean my grandparents had it in the eighties
22315	0	a	and I got it in ninety four , but still .
22316	0	a	It is crazy .
22317	0	a	Uh huh .
22318	0	a	So
22319	1	a	Should .
22320	0	a	In the eighties ?
22321	0	a	Right .
22322	0	a	My grammy does computer science back in the States and so they had an EDU and gov network .
22323	0	a	There is basically the fundamental structures , but it was not household to household yet because it had not been partitioned off and stuff ,
22324	0	a	yeah
22325	0	a	that was him .
22326	0	a	Yeah ,
22327	0	a	it was to the like seven universities or something .
22328	0	a	You guys ready to celebrate ?
22329	1	a	Celebrate .
22330	0	a	Yeah
22331	0	a	that is our last step .
22332	0	a	Apparently , does that include like champagne or something exciting ?
22333	0	a	I think so .
22334	0	a	Celebration .
22335	0	a	Kay
22336	1	a	I guess we can probably call that meeting to an end for the most part .
22337	0	a	I think that is a closer .
22338	0	a	Cool .
22339	0	a	Has it been forty minutes or whatever ?
22340	0	a	this has been long enough .
22341	0	a	Where do you find that ?
22342	0	a	Is this one of those media player ?
22343	0	a	W
22344	0	a	oh .
22345	0	a	I have no idea .
22346	0	a	Is that the only song you have ?
22347	0	a	That is awesome .
22348	0	a	There is another one .
22349	0	a	Huh ?
22350	0	a	The default track .
22351	0	a	I thought it was David Burns , look into the eyeball .
22352	0	a	That is one that seems to be shipping with it shipped with for a while , maybe this is the new version .
22353	0	a	So
22354	0	a	is that a close ?
22355	0	a	Okay ,
22356	0	a	that is the end of the meeting .
22357	0	a	Yeah ,
22358	1	a	I guess we will call that a a doner .
22359	0	a	Thank you gentlemen .
22360	0	a	 
22361	0	a	Okay .
22362	0	a	Hi everybody and welcome to our kick off meeting for our new product that we are going to be designing .
22363	0	a	I am Mandy and I am the Project Manager .
22364	0	a	And I know all your names again , Courtney , Fenella and Amber .
22365	0	a	Yep .
22366	0	a	Yep .
22367	0	a	Alright .
22368	0	a	Okay ,
22369	1	a	so first let is go through this PowerPoint .
22370	0	a	I wonder what button I press ?
22371	0	a	Yeah ,
22372	1	a	or how about I just click ?
22373	0	a	Okay , here is our agenda for this meeting .
22374	1	a	Just do it on the arrow .
22375	0	a	we are going to start with our opening which was our introductions .
22376	0	a	We are going to get to know each other a little bit better .
22377	0	a	tool training , we are going to , I guess , figure out what to do on this project with our individual roles .
22378	0	a	we are going to make a project plan and then have some time for discussion and close up the meeting .
22379	0	a	Okay , here is our project .
22380	0	a	We are going to make a new remote control that is original , trendy and also user friendly .
22381	0	a	And how we are going to do
22382	0	a	it is each of us is going to
22383	0	a	We are going to have discuss the functional design first , how is it going to be used , what is the actual goal here , it has to operate TV , .
22384	0	a	And we are going to do individual work on that and then meet .
22385	0	a	Same thing with conceptual design .
22386	0	a	Just the basic overview of the project
22387	0	a	and then we are going to do individual work , meet .
22388	0	a	That is pretty much the the whole process for today .
22389	0	a	And then the detailed design , just more in depth , get the actual schematics of the remote .
22390	0	a	Okay .
22391	0	a	Alright .
22392	0	a	First we are going to start off by using our tools .
22393	0	a	And the whiteboard thing , do you guys want to give that a try even though the ink was not working or do you want to do it on here .
22394	1	a	I think we should forgo the whiteboard since we ca not actually see what we are writing .
22395	0	a	We could
22396	0	a	Yeah , we could on here .
22397	1	a	Alright , let is go forward then .
22398	0	a	right now so we are all going to draw our favourite animal and then sum up our favourite characteristics of that animal .
22399	0	a	Even if you are not a good drawer like me .
22400	0	a	Alright .
22401	0	a	Artistic skills , nil .
22402	0	a	Fine .
22403	0	a	Bless you .
22404	0	a	Oh , thanks .
22405	0	a	I draw like I am in grade five .
22406	0	a	Oh do I .

22408	0	a	Okay .
22409	0	a	Okay .
22410	1	a	And who would like to start us off ?
22411	0	a	Alright .
22412	1	a	I will go .
22413	0	a	this is my picture .
22414	0	a	I drew fish I like fish , because , you know , their whole water vascular system thing .
22415	0	a	It is pretty cool ,
22416	0	a	and they have got a pretty good habitat and they are pretty sometimes , sometimes vicious but that is okay .
22417	0	a	Yeah .
22418	0	a	Only if they are piranhas .
22419	0	a	Yeah , they they are easy , you know .
22420	0	a	Yeah .
22421	0	a	Alright .
22422	1	a	Who wants to go next ?
22423	0	a	No , it looks like a cat .
22424	1	a	I will go .
22425	0	a	I drew a kitty .
22426	0	a	It is pretty much impossible to tell that is a cat , but I love cats .
22427	0	a	No I
22428	0	a	I see it .
22429	0	a	No , I kne I knew .
22430	0	a	Yeah , it does look like a cat .
22431	0	a	I love cats because they are independent , they pretty much know what they want
22432	0	a	, they get it , they move on .
22433	0	a	I love cats , too .
22434	0	a	Yeah .
22435	0	a	I am a cat person .
22436	0	a	I am allergic to cats .
22437	0	a	I am allergic to cats , too .
22438	0	a	Oh , okay .
22439	0	a	If you are around one
22440	0	a	I had a roommate who was allergic , but if she was around my cat forever she became used to it , you know ,
22441	0	a	it is weird .
22442	0	a	In my next life .
22443	0	a	Yeah ,
22444	0	a	yeah , if you are around them for a long period of time
22445	0	a	Oh , yeah ,
22446	0	a	this summer
22447	0	a	I , oh I had to live with cats .
22448	0	a	I still ca not sleep with them in my room .
22449	0	a	Okay .
22450	0	a	It was crazy .
22451	0	a	Yeah .
22452	1	a	Okay , Fenella ?
22453	0	a	Badger .
22454	0	a	, I drew a badger .
22455	0	a	Cool .
22456	0	a	Yay .
22457	0	a	Well , yeah .
22458	0	a	Good choice .
22459	0	a	Why a badger ?
22460	0	a	Alright .
22461	0	a	I dunno , they are grumpy and nocturnal and
22462	0	a	Well , a little bit like
22463	0	a	the Yes .
22464	0	a	Are you trying to suggest something ?
22465	1	a	Well , we want to make a multifunctional remote ,
22466	0	a	right ?
22467	0	a	One remote for everything .
22468	0	a	And then , if you know Wind in the Willows badger .
22469	0	a	Oh , okay .
22470	0	a	Yeah and then I do not know if you know Brian .
22471	0	a	He is Liverpudlian writer .
22472	0	a	, that kind of books .
22473	0	a	Badgers are cool in that one too .
22474	0	a	Okay .
22475	1	a	And I am last .
22476	1	a	Kay .
22477	1	a	Look at my sad sad giraffe .
22478	0	a	No , that is good .
22479	0	a	No , no , no , it ends up looking like some kind of a dinosaur ,
22480	0	a	but whatever .
22481	0	a	I do not know even much about giraffes , but I just love the way they look .
22482	0	a	They are just such odd creatures , you know .
22483	0	a	I I like that they are so unique and individual , I guess .
22484	0	a	I do not know much about their behaviour or anything , though .
22485	0	a	Only seen a couple in zoos .
22486	0	a	You do not really have to , I mean , if you like them
22487	0	a	Right .
22488	0	a	Yeah ,
22489	0	a	but you can appreciate the way they look .
22490	0	a	Okay .
22491	0	a	Alright .
22492	1	a	Guess we are getting straight back into business here .
22493	0	a	the selling price for our remote is going to be twenty five Euro , and our profit aim is fifty million Euro .
22494	0	a	We are going to make this an international product marketed in the States , in Europe , in Asia .
22495	0	a	And our production cost to make that profit is going to be a max of twelve fifty Euro per remote .
22496	0	a	Okay .
22497	0	a	So we are going to talk for a little while .
22498	0	a	here are some topics that we might be able to discuss .
22499	0	a	Expe our experiences with remote controls , our first ideas about this new remote ,
22500	1	a	anything that you can bring to the table for this project .
22501	0	a	So .
22502	0	a	Now ?
22503	0	a	And everything being Wait , we have what , sound system , TV , DVD , VHS , TiVo ?
22504	0	a	But it is still there , so if po if we are going to do it
22505	0	a	Or if it is not like a Sony , if it is like a I do not know .
22506	0	a	Yeah .
22507	1	a	You want to start us off ?
22508	1	a	Anybody have anything to offer ?
22509	0	a	Right .
22510	0	a	I think they will be phasing VHS out shortly .
22511	0	a	Yeah , TiVo .
22512	0	a	TiVo .
22513	0	a	Okay .
22514	0	a	It needs to be compatible cause universal remote controls are never universal .
22515	0	a	They are never universal .
22516	0	a	That is right .
22517	0	a	Esp e especially if you buy a a not big product , DVD player , say , usually it does not work if it is not one of the
22518	0	a	Yeah .
22519	0	a	Yeah .
22520	0	a	Something from Sam is club .
22521	1	a	So we will have to figure it how to cover all the different variances in signals .
22522	0	a	Yeah .
22523	1	a	And what we need an insanely good instruction booklet ,
22524	0	a	because you always have to reconfigure all your contraptions to go with the remote anyways .
22525	0	a	Yeah .
22526	0	a	Kay ,
22527	0	a	and another thing that I think is important is the d the design of the product , how it feels in your hand .
22528	0	a	If it is just flat and kind of boring th those do not Nobody wants to buy those any more .
22529	0	a	They want the ergonomic ones .
22530	0	a	They want like the flashy lights .
22531	0	a	Yeah .
22532	0	a	Oh like this came from Las Vegas .
22533	0	a	Ones that ones that look high tech , too .
22534	0	a	But at the same time are simple .
22535	0	a	yeah .
22536	0	a	Right .
22537	0	a	So that people like my mother can use it .
22538	1	a	What about something with the curvature like that matches the curvature of a hand ?
22539	0	a	What kind of battery would we want to use ?
22540	0	a	Because battery changing is usually
22541	0	a	Okay .
22542	0	a	Yeah .
22543	0	a	Kay .
22544	0	a	Anybody have any experiences with remote controls that they can remember that
22545	0	a	Yeah .
22546	0	a	Just bad ones .
22547	0	a	That is true .
22548	0	a	D
22549	0	a	Double A .
22550	0	a	Double A .
22551	0	a	Do some of them use triple As though ?
22552	0	a	Okay .
22553	0	a	Yeah some use triple As .
22554	0	a	Some
22555	0	a	but
22556	0	a	Yeah ,
22557	0	a	I guess then it is
22558	0	a	If we need to do triple A we can , but most people usually have double As around .
22559	0	a	So double or triple ?
22560	0	a	Yeah ,
22561	1	a	if we want it to be more thin , then we would probably want to go with a triple A .
22562	0	a	Okay .
22563	0	a	Yeah .
22564	0	a	But that has to do with the size of it too .
22565	0	a	Right .
22566	0	a	Yeah .
22567	0	a	Well , w as long as we know that issue is Here we can
22568	0	a	Triple A .
22569	0	a	But
22570	0	a	it is okay , we do not have to decide about it now ,
22571	1	a	just as long as we remember battery type and size is important .
22572	0	a	Hey .
22573	1	a	Anything else ?
22574	0	a	Alright .
22575	0	a	Moving along .
22576	0	a	Oh ,
22577	0	a	we are closing the meeting .
22578	0	a	Next meeting is going to start in thirty minutes .
22579	0	a	Here is what we are going to do .
22580	0	a	the ID ,
22581	0	a	which is who ?
22582	0	a	Okay ,
22583	0	a	you are going to think about the working design .
22584	0	a	What do you think that means ?
22585	0	a	Okay .
22586	0	a	And UID , the technical fun functions design , making sure it does everything that we need the remote to do , the functionality of it , operating all those different things .
22587	0	a	Okay .
22588	0	a	And the marketing person , that is Courtney , is going to do the user requirements specification .
22589	0	a	I guess that means specifying what exactly the user is going to be looking for .
22590	0	a	Right ?
22591	0	a	I would think so .
22592	0	a	Okay .
22593	0	a	And you are going to get more specific instructions emailed to you in just a little while .
22594	1	a	Okay , so does anybody have anything they want to say before we close the meeting ?
22595	0	a	Okay .
22596	0	a	 
22597	0	a	Okay .
22598	0	a	welcome to our second meeting .
22599	0	a	This is the functional design meeting .
22600	0	a	And I hope you all had a good individual working time .
22601	1	a	Okay , let is get started .
22602	0	a	Okay , here is the agenda for the meeting .
22603	0	a	After the opening I am going to fulfil the role of secretary , take the meeting minutes .
22604	0	a	And we are going to have three presentations , one from each of you .
22605	0	a	Then we are going to discuss some new project requirements .
22606	0	a	going to come to a decision on the functions of the remote control .
22607	0	a	And then we are going to close up the meeting .
22608	0	a	And we are going to do this all in about forty minutes .
22609	0	a	Okay .
22610	0	a	First I want to discuss the goals of this meeting .
22611	0	a	First we need to determine the user requirements and the question that we can ask ourselves is what needs and desires are to be fulfilled by this remote control .
22612	0	a	And then we are going to determine the technical functions , what is the effect of the apparatus , what actually is it supposed to do , what do people pick up the remote and use it for .
22613	0	a	And then lastly we are going to determine its working design , how exactly will it perform its functions , that is the whole technical side of
22614	1	a	Kay I will just give you a minute , cause it looks like you are making some notes .
22615	0	a	Kay .
22616	0	a	Oh ,
22617	1	a	well let is go ahead and ,
22618	0	a	back , previous .
22619	1	a	So what I want to do right now is hear from all three of you , on your research that you just did .
22620	1	a	Who would like to start us off ?
22621	0	a	Kay .
22622	1	a	I do not mind going first .
22623	0	a	Okay .
22624	0	a	do you have a PowerPoint or no ?
22625	0	a	Okay .
22626	0	a	Yeah , it is in the should be in the m Project .
22627	0	a	Do you want us to do our PowerPoints now or
22628	1	a	I can go .
22629	0	a	You know you could you could do it yourself actually .
22630	0	a	Oh .
22631	0	a	Did you send it ?
22632	0	a	Okay .
22633	0	a	Save it in the project documents .
22634	0	a	Put it in Project Documents ,
22635	0	a	yeah .
22636	0	a	Okay .
22637	0	a	Mm mm mm .
22638	0	a	This one ?
22639	0	a	Okay .
22640	0	a	Sure .
22641	0	a	Yeah .
22642	0	a	Okay .
22643	0	a	Great .
22644	0	a	well ,
22645	0	a	the function of a remote control , as what we have been informed , is basically to send messages to the television set , for example , switch it on , switch it off , go to this channel , go to channel nine , turn the volume up , etcetera .
22646	0	a	some of the considerations is just for example the what it needs to include it is the numbers , you know , zero to nine , so you can move to a channel , the power button on slash off , the channel going up and down , volume going up and down , and then mute , a mute function .
22647	0	a	And then functions for VHS , DVD , for example , play , rewind , fast forward , stop , pause , enter .
22648	0	a	And enter would be for like , you know , the menus .
22649	0	a	And then other menus for DV as well as TV , whether that means like we can go and decide the brightness of the screen , things like that , all the more complicated functions of menus .
22650	1	a	And we can decide if that is what we want , , if we want to include that on the remote , if that is something that would stay on the TV itself , for example .
22651	0	a	Okay .
22652	0	a	Okay .
22653	0	a	These are two examples .
22654	0	a	and you can see on the left , it is got a lot more buttons , and I do not know if you can read it , but it says , step , go to , freeze , slow , repeat , program , mute , and
22655	0	a	so those are some of the buttons and so it gives you an idea of s one example .
22656	0	a	And then on the right , it is a lot more simpler , it is got volume , it is got the play the like circle set , which is play , rewind , but it is also what is fast forward is also like next on a menu .
22657	0	a	So you have functions that are d duplicating .
22658	0	a	Right .
22659	0	a	And you have a mute button and then the numbers and the eject , and the power button .
22660	0	a	So that gives you two different kinds , a more complex and more simple version .
22661	0	a	Okay .
22662	0	a	Ready .
22663	0	a	And then lastly , it is just the questions that we want to consider like what functions do we want it to include , and how simple , complex it should be ?
22664	0	a	And what functions it needs to complete .
22665	0	a	, what are needed to complete insulation process , cause , you know , that is something that also has to be considered and it is going to be hopefully a one time thing , when you set it up it should be set to go ,
22666	1	a	but we have to include the functions that can allow it to set up i in the first place .
22667	0	a	So that is it .
22668	0	a	Alright .
22669	0	a	Very good presentation .
22670	0	a	Thank you .
22671	0	a	You speak with such authority on the matter .
22672	0	a	Okay .
22673	0	a	Left .
22674	1	a	Who would like to follow that one up ?
22675	0	a	Now , that we have discussed
22676	0	a	Okay .
22677	1	a	Do you want me to run it or you want to
22678	0	a	Okay .
22679	1	a	Yeah , you should run it .
22680	0	a	Functional requirements .
22681	0	a	yes .
22682	0	a	Kay .
22683	0	a	Alright .
22684	0	a	Now we have Courtney with the functional requirements .
22685	0	a	Yes ,
22686	0	a	okay
22687	0	a	so we tested a hundred subjects in our lab , and we just we watched them and we also made them fill out a questionnaire , and we found that the users are not typically happy with current remote controls .
22688	0	a	Seventy five percent think they are ugly .
22689	0	a	Eighty percent want they have are willing to spend more , which is good news for us if we make it look fancier ,
22690	0	a	and basically w we just need something that really
22691	0	a	I mean there is some other points up there , but they it needs to be snazzy and
22692	0	a	it but yet simple .
22693	1	a	So that is really what we need to do .
22694	0	a	Wait .
22695	1	a	And we need we need it to be simple , yet it needs to be high tech looking .
22696	1	a	So
22697	0	a	Like
22698	0	a	They like I guess use the buttons a lot .
22699	0	a	And that meaning what ?
22700	0	a	Okay .
22701	0	a	Yeah .
22702	0	a	I do not know .
22703	0	a	It is from my research .
22704	0	a	Right .
22705	0	a	Okay , what do you m
22706	0	a	Oh , I am sorry .
22707	0	a	My team was not very clear .
22708	0	a	Only use ten percent of the buttons .
22709	0	a	That is okay .
22710	0	a	What do you mean by the current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user , like they have to press the buttons .
22711	0	a	I I think it is like the engineering versus user , whereas like the engineering she showed that the engineering ones are more complex and users do not really need all of the buttons that are contained on there , because they only use ten percent of the buttons really .
22712	0	a	Okay .
22713	0	a	Oh , right .
22714	0	a	The buttons .
22715	0	a	Okay .
22716	0	a	Yeah .
22717	0	a	Okay .
22718	0	a	We only use ten per cent of our brains .
22719	0	a	Good point .
22720	0	a	It works .
22721	0	a	It is a necessary evil .
22722	0	a	yeah .
22723	0	a	Ready for the next slide ?
22724	0	a	And so people say that they typically lose it , as you yourself know , because you probably lose your remote control all the time , much like any small appliance like a cellphone ,
22725	0	a	and they
22726	1	a	we need something simple ,
22727	0	a	because most people , well thirty four percent say that it is just too much time to learn how to use a new one ,
22728	0	a	and we do not want to go
22729	1	a	we do not want to vary too far from the normal standard remote ,
22730	0	a	but I mean they do need to be able to identify it , and RSI , I am not very sure what that is .
22731	0	a	Lost .
22732	0	a	S
22733	0	a	Wait ,
22734	0	a	is that like your ergonomics like your hand movements or something ?
22735	0	a	Like
22736	0	a	Channel , volume , power .
22737	0	a	It is okay .
22738	0	a	It is very important .
22739	0	a	Yes , it is important for the remote control world .
22740	0	a	Sh
22741	0	a	possibly .
22742	0	a	Could be , yeah .
22743	0	a	Do we really need t to provide more information on what RSI is ?
22744	1	a	Yeah ,
22745	0	a	I am just trying to move it .
22746	0	a	Oh .
22747	0	a	yeah , that is what my web site said ,
22748	0	a	I
22749	0	a	do not know .
22750	0	a	I think that is a pretty good guess though .
22751	0	a	Yeah , I would assume so .
22752	0	a	I think we are supposed to know it as remote control experts .
22753	0	a	It is like if you are holding it
22754	1	a	to just say , where are you , and thing beeps , you know .
22755	0	a	Yeah .
22756	0	a	But also s so the channel , the volume and the power buttons are the most important on our company website you can find like the specific statistics concerning to how much each button is used , but those are the definitely the top ones .
22757	0	a	It is okay .
22758	0	a	Okay .
22759	0	a	Next slide ?
22760	0	a	User friendly .
22761	0	a	Yes .
22762	1	a	And so personally I think that we need a modern eye catching design , but it it really needs to be simple .
22763	0	a	So saying from y your slide , your presentation , the engineering versus the user specified remotes ,
22764	1	a	I think that we should go with something that is more user friendly .
22765	0	a	Where the engineering ones , the boxes , tend to make it look more complicated than it really is .
22766	1	a	the functionality of the product really needs to be considered as to like what type of buttons do we really need on it .
22767	1	a	And it needs to be open to a wide range of consumers , so even though we need a small number of buttons , we also need to take in like are most people going to be using it for a DVD player , a TiVo , what what exactly are we using it for ,
22768	0	a	as well as the age range .
22769	1	a	So we need a hip , but not a corny marketing scheme for promoting our product .
22770	0	a	And also we found our team found that speech recognition is it is like an up and coming thing
22771	0	a	they really
22772	0	a	consumers are really interested in it ,
22773	1	a	and since our findings found that people are willing to pay more money for a remote for it to be more high class we could consider it .
22774	0	a	And so just to
22775	0	a	just to clarify by speech recognition you mean they would say , channel five , and the thing would go to channel five ?
22776	0	a	Okay .
22777	0	a	I guess so , yeah .
22778	0	a	Yeah ,
22779	1	a	I guess we can interpret it like , we can just try out different types of speech recognition within our remote programme .
22780	0	a	Oh , that would be lovely .
22781	0	a	Yeah .
22782	0	a	Did not they did not our rival companies manufacture a remote that you would press the button on the TV and it would the remote would beep so if you have lost it
22783	0	a	It is kind of like what the remote phone used to do .
22784	0	a	Oh , yeah , that is true .
22785	0	a	You know like go to the base .
22786	1	a	We could definitely include that if we wanted to .
22787	0	a	Yeah .
22788	0	a	If it is within our price .
22789	0	a	Okay .
22790	1	a	Are we ready for our last presentation , Amber ?
22791	0	a	Okay .
22792	0	a	Kay .
22793	0	a	I think it should be there , working design .
22794	0	a	Working design .
22795	0	a	There we go .
22796	0	a	Kay .
22797	0	a	Kay .
22798	0	a	I did not get a chance to complete this one , cause some of the tools that I was given were frustrating .
22799	0	a	Oh my bad .
22800	0	a	Oh that is fine .
22801	0	a	okay , so method method of our design
22802	0	a	, I think I just start listing th some of the things that we actually need to put into this .
22803	0	a	Help me .
22804	0	a	We need a power source , we are going to need a smart chip if we are going to make it multi functional .
22805	0	a	extra functions will probably need an additional chip .
22806	0	a	Either that or the smart chip will have to be extremely smart .
22807	0	a	What exactly is a smart chip ?
22808	0	a	So what exactly we are looking at , is this like the front of the remote ?
22809	0	a	Oh okay .
22810	0	a	Usually a smart chip is just a chip that is been programmed and designed so that it can complete a fair range of functions .
22811	0	a	Well , how much extra would the additional chip be ?
22812	0	a	Is that going to push us over our production costs ?
22813	0	a	I would not think so , cause we could probably get it from like , in bulk , from a a newer company .
22814	0	a	And they tend to sell their chips pretty cheap .
22815	0	a	Okay .
22816	0	a	Ready ?
22817	0	a	That is okay .
22818	0	a	yep , nothing here .
22819	1	a	power source , I figured , batteries ,
22820	0	a	cause they are easily available .
22821	0	a	Typically a remote has either two double As or four triple As , sometimes three .
22822	0	a	it really kind of depends on the size of the actual remote itself .
22823	0	a	a large on off button , demographically we are moving towards an older generation of people ,
22824	1	a	so a large on off button would probably be good .
22825	0	a	Selection button for various entertainment devices , so you want something that will permit you to select the DVD player or the TV or the stereo system .
22826	0	a	smart chip that perverts that permits , sorry , universal application again , something that will allow us to skip over between devices , and that is kind of it .
22827	0	a	this is my fifty second design .
22828	0	a	Power source over here .
22829	1	a	We are going to have a switch obviously between the power source and the rest of it , and you are going to need the switch .
22830	1	a	extra bulb could just be for flashiness ,
22831	0	a	subcomponent which would be like a way of diverting the power to different parts of the the device .
22832	0	a	the chip and of course the infra red bulb , so it can communicate with the various devices that it needs to talk to .
22833	0	a	This is just like a rough schematic .
22834	0	a	So this would be the front ?
22835	0	a	So the red would be the front of the remote though , right ?
22836	0	a	Okay .
22837	0	a	So this is the internal workings .
22838	0	a	Yeah .
22839	0	a	Yeah , that is going to be what is communicating with the TV ,
22840	0	a	but the other bulb , I think , is good to just to indicate , I am doing something , it is sort of like a reassurance .
22841	0	a	The l the light up kind of
22842	0	a	Yeah .
22843	0	a	Like that we know the battery is working .
22844	0	a	Yeah , so you do not have to stare at that infra red ,
22845	0	a	cause you know when the battery starts dying in your remote currently , you have to actually stare at that bulb and go , okay , when I push this button , is it working ?
22846	1	a	We can skip that whole thing .
22847	0	a	Okay .
22848	0	a	It would probably be lighting up the key too ,
22849	0	a	right ?
22850	0	a	Kay .
22851	0	a	Yep .
22852	0	a	Yeah .
22853	0	a	Yeah .
22854	0	a	So you can put it in the dark .
22855	0	a	The buttons .
22856	0	a	Yeah , and that is good .
22857	1	a	We should make it glow in the dark .
22858	0	a	Okay .
22859	0	a	Yeah , definitely .
22860	0	a	Kay nex R Ready ?
22861	0	a	Kay , any p Kay ?
22862	1	a	Anything you want to add for personal preferences though ,
22863	0	a	you f
22864	0	a	you said already that we needed a large on off button , you think .
22865	0	a	Yeah , that is it .
22866	0	a	kay .
22867	0	a	I think that that is a good idea ,
22868	0	a	because you know that is one of the most important buttons .
22869	1	a	Anything else ?
22870	0	a	Okay .
22871	0	a	Just
22872	0	a	Well , should it be larger buttons in general ,
22873	0	a	you know like the examples that I had , they were swi quite small .
22874	1	a	So should we try and go for something that has l larger buttons ?
22875	1	a	Ovals .
22876	0	a	I think we should .
22877	0	a	Like I think that would be in a as in like in for the design ,
22878	0	a	sorry , .
22879	1	a	I think we should definitely go with buttons that do not look like a normal remote ,
22880	0	a	cause most remotes have small square buttons ,
22881	1	a	I think we should do something like maybe bigger and round like bubbles .
22882	0	a	Yeah ,
22883	0	a	yeah .
22884	0	a	Okay .
22885	0	a	Okay , let is talk about all of our
22886	1	a	We will come to decision later about all the components that we need to include , let is wrap up this one ,
22887	1	a	and I am going to go back to my PowerPoint ,
22888	0	a	cause we need to discuss the new project requirements which you might have already seen flashed up on the screen a bit earlier .
22889	0	a	Wait , come back .
22890	0	a	Alright .
22891	0	a	Sorry ,
22892	1	a	let is go through this .
22893	0	a	Alright .
22894	0	a	Here we go .
22895	0	a	New product requirements .
22896	0	a	First it is only going to be a TV remote .
22897	0	a	We are trying not to over complicate things .
22898	0	a	So no DVD , no TiVo , no stereo .
22899	0	a	Okay .
22900	0	a	It is not going to be multi functional .
22901	0	a	Hey .
22902	0	a	And we th need to promote our company more , so we need to somehow include our colour and our company slogan on the remote .
22903	0	a	We are trying to get our name out there in the world .
22904	0	a	Okay .
22905	0	a	And you know what teletext is ?
22906	0	a	in States we do not have it , but it is like they just have this channel where just has news and weather , kind of sports , it is very bland looking
22907	0	a	, it is just text on the screen ,
22908	0	a	not even
22909	0	a	Yeah ,
22910	0	a	just black with just text .
22911	0	a	Yeah .
22912	0	a	I know .
22913	0	a	What is it ?
22914	0	a	Like running along the bottom ?
22915	0	a	Wait ,
22916	0	a	is it like the Weather Channel where it is got like the ticker running on the bottom or something ?
22917	0	a	So it is like a separate channel from like what you are watching ?
22918	0	a	Okay .
22919	0	a	Yeah ,
22920	0	a	it is like black , black and white kind of It will give you the sports .
22921	0	a	Yeah .
22922	0	a	You can also get the kind of the TV guide
22923	0	a	so It is the entire screen is just running information at random .
22924	0	a	Kind of .
22925	0	a	Except the entire screen .
22926	0	a	Yeah it is the whole screen .
22927	0	a	You can pick sports , you can pick the news , you entertainment ,
22928	0	a	you know it is like
22929	0	a	Yeah .
22930	0	a	So anyway
22931	0	a	Right .
22932	0	a	Seemingly .
22933	0	a	Right .
22934	0	a	But it is becoming out dated now , because of the Internet .
22935	0	a	Nobody needs to go to the teletext channel to check the news , and we have twenty four hour news channels now too , so Those are our new product requirements .
22936	0	a	Okay .
22937	0	a	So , do we have to include the company colour within that ?
22938	1	a	well , even if we kept the regular standard size of remote , if we reduced the buttons down to the ones that people are saying that they use the most often and a couple extra ,
22939	0	a	cause they are saying they only use ten per cent of them ,
22940	0	a	then we should be able to accommodate fairly decent sized buttons .
22941	0	a	Alright .
22942	0	a	Yes .
22943	0	a	It is part of the logo .
22944	0	a	Okay .
22945	0	a	Company colour being yellow .
22946	1	a	What we are going to do right now is come to some decisions , definitive that we can all agree on , about the target group and the functions
22947	0	a	and just definite things that we need to do
22948	0	a	and then we will close up the meeting .
22949	0	a	So .
22950	0	a	Alright .
22951	0	a	Whatever .
22952	0	a	Okay .
22953	0	a	So our target group is You mentioned older people ?
22954	0	a	Would it just be universal for everyone , you think ?
22955	0	a	Because I think even if something has large buttons , as long as they are not childishly large , like even technically non technically challenged people are going to use it .
22956	0	a	It is going to make it nicer .
22957	0	a	Yeah .
22958	0	a	I mean they want something user friendly , so
22959	0	a	Yeah .
22960	0	a	Yeah .
22961	1	a	Okay , so we want for our target group would we say , I mean , young and old , all age ranges ,
22962	0	a	all ,
22963	1	a	not kids obviously ,
22964	0	a	right ?
22965	0	a	Or kids ?
22966	0	a	Okay ,
22967	1	a	so we are going to go anywhere from kids to adult in the age range
22968	1	a	what about technic technical specifications ,
22969	0	a	like how how technically literate are these people who are going to be using our remote ?
22970	0	a	Okay .
22971	0	a	No ,
22972	0	a	kids need to know how to use a remote , I would think .
22973	0	a	Most of them will intuitively pick it up though .
22974	0	a	They gotta change between Disney Channel , Cartoon Network .
22975	0	a	Yeah , I think we need it all .
22976	0	a	I would say we should say dumber than the average person .
22977	1	a	We should go for the lowest denominator .
22978	0	a	Yeah .
22979	0	a	Right , okay .
22980	0	a	High school educated .
22981	0	a	So so they need no technical experience to operate
22982	0	a	Okay .
22983	1	a	how about little to no ,
22984	0	a	because there is no way that you are going to be able to make it no .
22985	1	a	And we also need to determine the specific functions of this ,
22986	0	a	just to get it all out on paper .
22987	0	a	So we said it needs to send messages to the TV , needs to change the channel , turn on and off , just basic simple stuff like this .
22988	1	a	So if you have something just say it and we will add it to my meeting minutes .
22989	0	a	Well it is channel , on off button , volume , mute .
22990	0	a	, volume .
22991	0	a	And channel .
22992	0	a	Yeah .
22993	0	a	Those are the most important ones .
22994	0	a	Right .
22995	0	a	And we want to keep
22996	1	a	I will make a note here that we want to keep the number of buttons down .
22997	0	a	Correct ,
22998	0	a	because people only use ten percent .
22999	0	a	Yeah .
23000	0	a	Kay .
23001	1	a	Hey , what else ?
23002	0	a	Do we want this thing to be able to be found easily ?
23003	0	a	And
23004	1	a	like if this is going to get lost underneath the coach , how are we going to accommodate the quick ability to find it ?
23005	1	a	What if we gave it a charger ?
23006	0	a	And on the charger , just like a phone , like you get a portable phone and it is got a charger , and if you d leave your phone somewhere , you push the button to find it , and it finds th the phone beeps for you .
23007	0	a	I think so .
23008	0	a	What do you
23009	1	a	A finding kind of device or
23010	0	a	Yeah , ho homing device .
23011	0	a	Sure , yeah .
23012	0	a	I need
23013	1	a	we we need a like homing device .
23014	0	a	Oh right
23015	0	a	yeah
23016	0	a	okay .
23017	0	a	kay .
23018	0	a	Tracking .
23019	0	a	Because people really are looking for a remote that is more high tech .
23020	0	a	Okay .
23021	0	a	Right .
23022	0	a	But you got a base .
23023	0	a	Do you think people will really go for that though ?
23024	0	a	Because
23025	0	a	Yeah .
23026	0	a	It is useful for the remote phone .
23027	0	a	Would that add to our costs at all , I wonder ?
23028	0	a	Right .
23029	0	a	I would think so , because you would have to develop a base .
23030	0	a	Well , if you have the base , you could start putting in a charger and then you have a different kind of battery .
23031	0	a	Yeah .
23032	0	a	Rechargeable batteries are cheaper usually .
23033	0	a	Yeah .
23034	0	a	Okay .
23035	1	a	I I think we can make a decision about that later .
23036	1	a	we will still put that as a point that we need to discuss .
23037	0	a	So that would include battery source Power source rather .
23038	0	a	Is it going to have a charger , or is it going to be run strictly off batteries ?
23039	0	a	And we also need to deal with the issue you mentioned of speech recognition , if we want that .
23040	0	a	Right .
23041	0	a	Do w
23042	0	a	Well , th there is the people who desire speech recognition , there is the different demog demographics have different desires ,
23043	0	a	I do not know if you guys ge
23044	0	a	It would not copy onto the the thing cause it is black , but all the different age groups have different desires for speech recognition .
23045	0	a	Well , then we could
23046	0	a	If we have the speech recognition then we can start aiming at a like another kind of more handicapped disabled demo demographic .
23047	0	a	You could
23048	1	a	we could hook it up .
23049	0	a	Oh .
23050	0	a	So basically older people do not really care .
23051	0	a	It is really the people twenty five to thirty five .
23052	0	a	I feel those are the people that really watch a lot of TV though .
23053	0	a	They are the ones that get addicted to soap operas and just sitcoms and stuff .
23054	0	a	Well
23055	0	a	Well , then then do you put the voice recognition
23056	0	a	do you put the r like receiver on the actual television , in the base , or in the actual remote ,
23057	0	a	cause then you have already got remote in your hand , why you just going to speak to the remote ,
23058	0	a	whereas if you just speak in general and you do not have to have the remote in your hand and like talk at it .
23059	0	a	And if and if we introduced it when they are this age , they are going to probably always buy a remote that has
23060	0	a	Right .
23061	0	a	Right .
23062	0	a	So
23063	0	a	Right .
23064	0	a	Yeah .
23065	0	a	and the speech recognition could be part of the lost and found device , too .
23066	0	a	If we said , find remote , locate remote , or something .
23067	0	a	A certain phrase then it could beep .
23068	0	a	I dunno .
23069	1	a	Just throwing it out there .
23070	0	a	Yeah .
23071	0	a	Well
23072	1	a	Okay , anything else we want to discuss ?
23073	0	a	Still fifteen minutes .
23074	0	a	Well , do we want to include the numbers like zero through nine ?
23075	0	a	Can we conceive of leaving them out ?
23076	0	a	Yeah , like you have one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight , nine , zero .
23077	0	a	Wait ,
23078	0	a	on the remote itself ?
23079	0	a	Well , we definitely need those .
23080	0	a	How how ,
23081	0	a	yeah ,
23082	0	a	how would you leave those out ?
23083	0	a	Unless you could say the channel .
23084	0	a	Yeah .
23085	0	a	Well , I do not know ,
23086	0	a	I mean , if you can like well
23087	0	a	I do not know , if there is just a way of leaving them out ?
23088	0	a	The colour being yellow ?
23089	0	a	And how do we
23090	0	a	Ca not make it entirely
23091	0	a	Well if you have like a
23092	0	a	Hang on .
23093	0	a	I think people would find that too foreign .
23094	0	a	Yeah .
23095	0	a	Yeah , that is true .
23096	0	a	You definitely need
23097	0	a	Wait .
23098	0	a	And also remember that in this day in age we need , you know , like a hundred button , too .
23099	0	a	I used to have a remote that did not even go up past like fifty .
23100	0	a	So I could not whenever I got cable , I had to get a new TV .
23101	0	a	It is when we get satellite .
23102	0	a	get your own remote , or digital cable .
23103	0	a	Yeah .
23104	0	a	Kay .
23105	0	a	I guess , we are going to discuss the project financing later , making sure that we can fit all of the stuff that we want to on our budget .
23106	0	a	Yeah ,
23107	0	a	cause I do not have any material pricing information available to me at the moment , so R the double R .
23108	0	a	Kay .
23109	0	a	And do not forget we need to include the colour of our company and the logo .
23110	0	a	I am guessing .
23111	0	a	I feel like a
23112	0	a	I feel like a yellow one would be too garish .
23113	0	a	And the RR .
23114	1	a	We could just have the logo in yellow , or maybe a yellow light for the keys .
23115	0	a	Or is the l
23116	0	a	Yeah ,
23117	0	a	yellow could be and
23118	0	a	it could
23119	0	a	does not have to be huge .
23120	1	a	Or put like stripes ,
23121	0	a	oh yeah , yellow lights .
23122	0	a	Yeah .
23123	1	a	If you have this sort of strip kind of down at the bottom the base of it , just like yellow with the RR .
23124	0	a	Right .
23125	0	a	So we have simplified , we do not need all those play , fast forward , rewind , or no menu buttons .
23126	0	a	Right
23127	0	a	, yeah .
23128	0	a	Yeah .
23129	0	a	So we have pretty much pared it down to on off , volume , mute , channel up and down , the numbers
23130	0	a	Yeah .
23131	0	a	Yeah .
23132	0	a	can we go back to
23133	1	a	I am going to look really quickly back at those examples and see if there is anything .
23134	0	a	Two examples .
23135	0	a	Yeah .
23136	0	a	Which one is yours , technical functions or functional requirement ?
23137	0	a	Okay .
23138	0	a	Oh , it is a
23139	0	a	Yeah .
23140	1	a	Yeah , audi audio settings and screen settings
23141	1	a	, we need those
23142	0	a	like audio settings mono , stereo , pitch , screen settings like brightness , colour ,
23143	0	a	or do we just want that accessed accessed from the television itself ?
23144	0	a	Yeah , cause we need to we definitely need to have buttons for like sub titles and things like that .
23145	0	a	The TV .
23146	0	a	I think that that is fine just for the TV .
23147	0	a	I mean how often does the average user need to do that kind of stuff ?
23148	1	a	Well , the other option is sort of like down at the bottom , like farther away ,
23149	0	a	you just have this sort of box inset where it is like the buttons that you do not use as much , but occasionally you will use .
23150	0	a	and so it is like
23151	0	a	I do not well , I do not know .
23152	0	a	It is cause the foreign film market is expanding and stuff , and like on television like I know f
23153	0	a	k living in Los Angeles it is tons of Spanish network television
23154	0	a	if it has English sub titles it is definitely helpful .
23155	1	a	Could not we do that all through one button , something , a menu button , that pops up with a menu on the TV that says , you know , audio , video , whatever , language ,
23156	0	a	you know ?
23157	0	a	For the menus .
23158	0	a	Right .
23159	0	a	So we need up , down , and side to side buttons .
23160	0	a	Well , that could be
23161	0	a	No
23162	0	a	you could just double up with like the channel or the volume buttons .
23163	0	a	That is true .
23164	0	a	Yeah , okay .
23165	0	a	Channel is just up and down .
23166	0	a	Okay , yeah .
23167	1	a	And then add a
23168	0	a	Yeah .
23169	1	a	Something that looks mayb you know .
23170	1	a	Such as , yeah , the one the one over there on the left the engineering centred one .
23171	0	a	Y right , right right right .
23172	0	a	That one ?
23173	0	a	Right .
23174	1	a	In the middle perhaps .
23175	0	a	Yep .
23176	0	a	Ooh ,
23177	0	a	good .
23178	1	a	Anybody have anything else they would like to bring up in this meeting ?
23179	0	a	Okay .
23180	0	a	get out of here .
23181	1	a	Let is go back to the meeting closure then and see what we need to do next .
23182	0	a	Alright .
23183	0	a	After this meeting we are going to be sent a questionnaire and summary again which we need to reply to that e mail .
23184	0	a	And then we are going to have lunch break .
23185	0	a	And after lunch thirty minutes of individual work time .
23186	0	a	I am going to put the minutes
23187	0	a	I put the minutes for the first meeting already in the project documents folder ,
23188	1	a	if you would like to review them .
23189	0	a	And I am going to type up the minutes for this one as well .
23190	0	a	here is what we are each going to do .
23191	0	a	The ID is going to work on the components concept , UID the user interface concept , and you are going to do some trend watching .
23192	0	a	Kay .
23193	0	a	Specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach .
23194	1	a	And if anybody has anything they would like to add ?
23195	0	a	No ?
23196	0	a	Okay , well , this meeting is officially over .
23197	0	a	 
23198	0	a	Okay .
23199	0	a	Hi Team .
23200	0	a	Hope you had a good lunch .
23201	0	a	Okay we are back for the conceptual design meeting .
23202	1	a	let is get started .
23203	0	a	Kay , here is the agenda for today is meeting .
23204	0	a	we are going to open it
23205	0	a	and I am going to keep the minutes as Project Manager .
23206	0	a	We are going to have three presentations , one from each of you again .
23207	0	a	And then we are going to come to decision on the remote control concepts and then we are going to close it up .
23208	0	a	And we have forty minutes again .
23209	0	a	Kay , and just to reiterate after this meeting the team will reach a decision on the concepts of the remote control .
23210	0	a	Okay .
23211	1	a	Let is go ahead and start off with your presentations .
23212	1	a	Who would like to go first ?
23213	0	a	Okay .
23214	0	a	Just trying to move mine right now .
23215	1	a	Courtney would you mind starting us off ?
23216	0	a	Okay .
23217	0	a	Yeah .
23218	0	a	Trend watching ?
23219	0	a	Kay .
23220	0	a	Yeah .
23221	0	a	Okay , so trend watching .
23222	0	a	since we do put the fashion in electronics , it is kind of important how our product looks .
23223	0	a	So I guess we can go ahead and go to the next .
23224	0	a	So what they want .
23225	0	a	Right now customers want fancy versus functional .
23226	0	a	basically about fifty eight percent of what
23227	0	a	they
23228	0	a	like of the product that they want , describing like the in order of how much they want , fifty eight per cent of the decision of what it should look like , fancy versus functional , and then it has to also be technologically innovative , and yet easy to use .
23229	0	a	So the customer basically is confused .
23230	0	a	They do not know exactly what they want .
23231	0	a	They want us to tell them .
23232	0	a	They want everything , but simply .
23233	0	a	Yes .
23234	0	a	Exactly .
23235	0	a	Okay .
23236	0	a	So we can go to next .
23237	0	a	kay .
23238	0	a	Okay .
23239	0	a	So in Milan and Paris recently the trends have been showing that clothing , shoes and furniture are basically just covered with fruits and vegetable patterns .
23240	0	a	So I do not know if we want to go with that
23241	0	a	and also the spongy feel is in in contrast to last year .
23242	0	a	I do not know really ,
23243	1	a	I mean I guess the spongy could relate to the buttons if we want to
23244	0	a	rather than like a hard clicky button that you find on like some mobiles and stuff , you would want like a softer touch .
23245	0	a	I mean do you guys know what I mean .
23246	0	a	Right .
23247	0	a	Yeah th
23248	0	a	I
23249	0	a	I can
23250	1	a	I can address some of that issue , I think , with my presentation .
23251	0	a	Yes .
23252	0	a	Yeah .
23253	0	a	But as for the fruits and vegetable patterns , I do not know if we really want to go with that ,
23254	0	a	because it is just a trend ,
23255	0	a	and our product we want to stay around for much longer than just a few months ,
23256	0	a	because
23257	0	a	Yeah .
23258	0	a	Right .
23259	0	a	Right .
23260	0	a	People do not buy a new remote every so often .
23261	0	a	I mean that could just be a Spring thing right now .
23262	0	a	Okay .
23263	0	a	Awesome .
23264	0	a	Okay .
23265	0	a	so design preferences ,
23266	1	a	we need easy to read like large buttons , clearly labelled
23267	0	a	so that , I mean cause we talked about that being a problem .
23268	1	a	and then also buttons illuminating upon touch ,
23269	0	a	you said that in your design , with the bulb .
23270	1	a	and that could also tie in with the colour scheme .
23271	0	a	we need the Real Reaction logo and colour scheme obviously .
23272	0	a	That is one of our key goals , we want to promote our product .
23273	0	a	And I was thinking about different types of designs and I came up with something .
23274	0	a	Actually right here .
23275	1	a	So what we could do is something like an old fashioned telephone like this , where we put the buttons around , like we would put a big on off button or something else in the middle , I mean it could be the arrows or whatever for channel up and down , and then put the numbers around in like an old fashioned dial shape .
23276	0	a	Cause then it will appeal to older generation and like said retro is cool .
23277	0	a	So it is classically retro .
23278	0	a	So I mean that is just an idea if you guys like it .
23279	0	a	Very good .
23280	0	a	I like it .
23281	0	a	Okay , ready for the next slide ?
23282	0	a	Op kay .
23283	0	a	And ,
23284	0	a	yep .
23285	0	a	And that is it .
23286	0	a	Okay .
23287	0	a	Great .
23288	0	a	Great presentation .
23289	0	a	Ready ?
23290	0	a	Kay .
23291	0	a	Okay
23292	0	a	hang on .
23293	1	a	See if it is there .
23294	0	a	Which one is it ?
23295	0	a	Interface concepts new .
23296	0	a	I do not know .
23297	0	a	Hang on .
23298	0	a	Interface concepts ,
23299	0	a	no ?
23300	1	a	Either refresh it ,
23301	0	a	or it sh
23302	0	a	Oh wait ,
23303	0	a	maybe I did not put it there .
23304	0	a	Y
23305	0	a	Kay .
23306	0	a	Hang on .
23307	0	a	Mine will always read copy of something or other .
23308	0	a	Sorry ?
23309	0	a	Oh okay .
23310	0	a	I I copied mine before I sent it over .
23311	0	a	Sorry ,
23312	0	a	hang on .
23313	0	a	Do not know .
23314	0	a	Oh there we go .
23315	0	a	Okay .
23316	0	a	Okay ,
23317	0	a	looking at the interface concept , it is going to be mostly examples of possibilities of where we can go with this .
23318	1	a	if you want to start the next slide .
23319	0	a	Sure .
23320	0	a	ca not really see , but there is two possible ways , on the r left ,
23321	0	a	if you see on th on the sides of of the remote , you have the sort of scroll down , so you have that option right there .
23322	0	a	And then also there is the idea of the base .
23323	0	a	That is sort of like an idea there .
23324	0	a	And then on the right , we have what is really big trend right now , it is the iPod .
23325	0	a	It is becoming really and so you have this sort of very very simplistic menu section with the round buttons , and it is sort of like you have the both kind of trendy and hip , but also very sleek and and very simple , but technologically advanced .
23326	1	a	So if you wanted to do that th if we could find a way of sort of like using that idea in a remote control then sort of look into it , but
23327	1	a	Anyway , next .
23328	0	a	kay .
23329	0	a	there is the idea of like being able to do it by feel as well as by by sight .
23330	0	a	You would you know you are in the dark , you do not want to be looking at the remote control .
23331	0	a	And the picture particularly is pointing out if you look at the top volume button it is a V , and so yo you are kind of feeling a V like volume up .
23332	0	a	What it really is is a V and
23333	0	a	what it you think it is is down , because the down arrow .
23334	0	a	And so it is like a sort of a criticism you would probably turn that o the other way up .
23335	0	a	but then you have you could either do it by raised type ,
23336	0	a	which could be you know , iffy , sort of old fashioned in a way .
23337	0	a	Either that or just have it by shape , for example you have a specific triangular shape that you know you are looking at the up and down arrow .
23338	0	a	And then the round ones you sort of feel by , you know , that is the second one down , that sort of thing .
23339	0	a	So it is sort of looking into how we wanted t to do it by feel .
23340	0	a	Okay .
23341	0	a	Okay .
23342	0	a	this is sort of an example of going for a s certain demographic .
23343	0	a	this is particularly geared towards children .
23344	0	a	That is cute .
23345	0	a	it is very cute ,
23346	1	a	and we could probably change it to yellow , bright yellow for like a the for the company logo .
23347	0	a	and you have the shapes and it is very simplistic and friendly looking .
23348	0	a	and then the other thing that it would be able to do is just to pro be ab you program certain channels that only these children would watch ,
23349	0	a	so it is like they ch
23350	0	a	watch , you know , the C Beebies or something like that
23351	0	a	, keep them away from other channels .
23352	0	a	So that is like another ar ,
23353	0	a	I mean , these are three examples sort of looking at it .
23354	0	a	Okay .
23355	0	a	You have the wider section for the main controls there .
23356	0	a	you could see how many buttons there are .
23357	0	a	And then on the left you have an example of the round buttons , and a simpler design .
23358	0	a	On the bottom we probably would not need that ,
23359	0	a	because it is more for like a DVD function which we are not going to be using .
23360	0	a	So again it is sort of like just give you ideas and then down at the bottom you have the logos
23361	1	a	and that is where you could put the RR , Real Reaction .
23362	0	a	Kay .
23363	0	a	And then finally these are like the sort of same examples , but also some more , just possibilities that we could go with .
23364	0	a	None of them I am particularly keen on by the way .
23365	0	a	Yeah .
23366	0	a	No .
23367	0	a	But it is sort of like just taking aspects out of that and saying , well out of this one we like , you know the round section of , b or we would like the the button size on this .
23368	0	a	Or I like , you know , the black finish or the silver finish or whatever .
23369	0	a	Right .
23370	0	a	I have four of those remotes .
23371	0	a	Good lord .
23372	0	a	Okay .
23373	0	a	Ready ?
23374	0	a	Oh , yeah .
23375	0	a	That is it .
23376	0	a	Okay .
23377	0	a	Great job .
23378	1	a	Okay , my turn .
23379	0	a	Okay .
23380	0	a	Okay .
23381	0	a	Whoo .
23382	0	a	What is the title ?
23383	0	a	Got it .
23384	0	a	It will be copy of component design .
23385	0	a	Yeah .
23386	0	a	Th that looks like it .
23387	0	a	Kay .
23388	0	a	So basic remote operation runs as follows , press button makes connection with the power source and the rest of the circuit , chip senses the connection , chip produces a morse code infra red signal , specific to that button .
23389	0	a	So you press the button , it produces a signal that is encoded specifically for that button .
23390	0	a	Transistors amplify that signal and it goes to the TV is centre , which interprets the signal response accordingly , changes channel etcetera .
23391	0	a	So that being said
23392	1	a	Next slide , please .
23393	0	a	Findings
23394	0	a	oh which were the required materials for the basic internal construction , so all the really simplistic functions that we just discussed ,
23395	0	a	we need rubber for buttons , aluminium for battery y contacts , integrated circuit which consists of a diode , transistor , resonator , resistors , and a capacitator ,
23396	0	a	all those basic things that make a circuit function .
23397	0	a	fibreglass and thin copper wire to create the actual circuit board itself .
23398	0	a	An LED , which is a light emitting diode , contact discs for the buttons , plastic for the casing , and a power source , whatever power source we have actually determined we want .
23399	1	a	Next slide , please .
23400	0	a	Thank you .
23401	0	a	personal preferences ,
23402	1	a	to save money for the components , the remote should be mass produced and basic materials should be bought en masse .
23403	1	a	if we find another company who can produce the required chips , casing , LED , any additional materials we decide we require at a less expensive rate than we ourselves are producing , we should go for it .
23404	1	a	Next slide , please .
23405	0	a	just talking to the manufacturing division .
23406	0	a	They suggested power options , solar cells , hand dynamo , and kinetic power , so you shake it and it increases the power .
23407	0	a	I am not sure how the hand dynamo works , they have yet to get back to me on that .
23408	1	a	So next slide , please .
23409	0	a	Interesting .
23410	0	a	Suggested casing options .
23411	0	a	Okay .
23412	0	a	We can offer options for casing such as straight , curved , double curved , you know , very specific to the customer .
23413	0	a	Options for materials , plastic , rubber , titanium , wood .
23414	0	a	I do not think anyone is going to go for a wood one , because splinters
23415	0	a	Yeah .
23416	0	a	That would be amazing , though , yeah .
23417	0	a	No , splinters would
23418	0	a	What is that ?
23419	0	a	certain restrictions do apply here though .
23420	0	a	latex , you ca not do solar power with a latex one .
23421	0	a	So , if they want some a soft squishy rubber , they ca not have the solar powered option .
23422	0	a	Double curved , you ca not do titanium .
23423	0	a	that would be two curvatures , so it would actually , if you the shape of your hand , you curve here and you curve here , so you could have two curves that match the shape of your hand to make it more comfortable to hold .
23424	0	a	Now if you wanted that , you ca not do titanium .
23425	1	a	And so you functions what for the buttons , scrolling function could be very beneficial to us instead of actual buttons themselves .
23426	0	a	Right .
23427	0	a	I think I have one more slide .
23428	0	a	Kay .
23429	0	a	No , I did not .
23430	0	a	No , okay .
23431	0	a	the manufacturing division also has said that they have several types of chips and they have just developed a sample sensor or sample speaker chip , which we could utilise .
23432	0	a	push button requires a simple chip and scroll requires more complicated chip .
23433	0	a	So depends on what we decide we want to do .
23434	1	a	In addition to that if we are offering all those different options to the customer for producing their remote , we are going to have to have multiples of each type , like a double curved in rubber , you know , each option should have a certain select number produced with all those options .
23435	1	a	So we will have to mix it up , make sure we produce enough of everyone .
23436	0	a	But that could also drive up the price of the actual remote itself if they know that we only produced five thousand , you know , double curved wooden remotes .
23437	0	a	Right .
23438	0	a	Okay .
23439	0	a	And that is all I got .
23440	0	a	Okay .
23441	0	a	Alright , well thank you for those informative presentations .
23442	0	a	Let is go back to
23443	1	a	Now we have to make some decisions .
23444	0	a	Where were we ?
23445	0	a	Sure .
23446	1	a	Let me just add one more thing that I could not say before ,
23447	0	a	and that is just that there is the new technology that they have developed on the voice recognition .
23448	0	a	Oh this the thing we were talking about earlier .
23449	0	a	Right except that it is sort of odd , and I am no not exactly sure why they are explaining it in the way they are ,
23450	0	a	there is a sample sensor and there is a sample speaker unit for So , you would say like , good morning , coffeemaker , and it would respond , good morning , Jill , but I am not sure exactly how it is going to work , cause do you programme do we program the responses and the questions .
23451	0	a	So does that mean that the user then has to ask the specific question , and ca not change it in order for it to be recognised , or can it be altered in a certain way , or does the actually user program it , to say a channel means this .
23452	0	a	Right .
23453	0	a	Yeah ,
23454	0	a	like using the menu to be like , enter your name into the screen like on the menu options .
23455	0	a	Right .
23456	0	a	So that way the remote reads it .
23457	0	a	Right ,
23458	0	a	so it is got like a limited memory and programme it .
23459	0	a	So it is sort of iffy ,
23460	0	a	but that is kind of what you would say .
23461	0	a	I feel like voice recognition would be , I do not know , w it would be too hard to really
23462	0	a	I mean we could do it , but
23463	0	a	Technology .
23464	0	a	Programme .
23465	0	a	If it is within our price to get that kind of chip that would , you know , technology
23466	0	a	Well , we are making the chip .
23467	0	a	So , I mean
23468	1	a	But , I guess , we have to look at w what our production cost is for the chip itself anyway .
23469	0	a	And it is a growing trend , the higher technological , like
23470	0	a	the , I mean just like the more advanced it is , the better it will sell .
23471	0	a	Yeah .
23472	0	a	Yeah .
23473	1	a	I I thought offering some of those options for different materials that it could be made of different , you know I think we would have to decide on the power options , maybe .
23474	1	a	So that we could reduce cost .
23475	0	a	Yeah ,
23476	0	a	cause we need to know how big it is going to be and how heavy .
23477	0	a	Yeah .
23478	0	a	Okay , that kind of brings us to this ,
23479	1	a	let is let is see if we can decide what kind of energy source we want to have first and foremost .
23480	0	a	Okay .
23481	0	a	Do we want to go for batteries or a stand like the one that we saw illustrated earlier ?
23482	0	a	The base , the charging base with rechargeable batteries ?
23483	0	a	Oh the base , yeah .
23484	0	a	I think the p
23485	0	a	That is true .
23486	0	a	I always feel like first I want to know what it looks like , before Cause
23487	0	a	if it is something really really small , then it is sort of harder to imagine a base for it ,
23488	0	a	that was p quite a s substantial size sort of standing up
23489	0	a	Right .
23490	0	a	Yeah ,
23491	0	a	and we do not have multiple things that it has to control , it just has to control the TV .
23492	0	a	W
23493	1	a	We need to decide , well so we can figure how big it is going to be , like exactly what buttons we want
23494	0	a	and exactly
23495	1	a	It could be like this .
23496	0	a	It is not going to be a huge universal remote .
23497	1	a	What size battery and
23498	0	a	Right .
23499	1	a	Well , the other thing is like even if it is got a few buttons , so we want it to be bigger than this ,
23500	0	a	cause it still fits in your hand , so you still wanted something that is comfortable and substantial , but not necessarily full of buttons .
23501	0	a	Yes .
23502	0	a	I would , well
23503	0	a	This one is really comfortable , like I like the sides whatever ,
23504	0	a	because
23505	0	a	But if we have the , the locator , then we do not have to worry about that .
23506	0	a	Are you going to lose it easier ?
23507	0	a	Yeah .
23508	0	a	So we can make it small if we have a l locating device .
23509	0	a	If we do a voice activated locator , though , we are going to be looking at a more substantial chip .
23510	0	a	So
23511	0	a	Honestly , I think the customer would be kind of irritated by the fact that it has a base
23512	1	a	if we did do a nice small , compact
23513	0	a	yeah .
23514	0	a	So i That is the other thing ,
23515	0	a	it is like You know
23516	0	a	Are we going to have certain chips that are going to require bigger size period ?
23517	0	a	But like , you know , if we get more complicated then it is going to v be have to be bigger to just accommodate the chip size .
23518	0	a	Two double As , for this size .
23519	0	a	Right .
23520	0	a	I agree ,
23521	1	a	it is either going to be bigger with a base or smaller with just A battery like this guy .
23522	0	a	Yeah .
23523	0	a	So we sh
23524	0	a	Yeah .
23525	0	a	Smaller , without
23526	0	a	Yeah .
23527	0	a	Alright , so what direction do you want to go in ?
23528	0	a	You want to vote ?
23529	0	a	I am kind of I am kind of leaning in the direction of this kind of bigger and the base .
23530	0	a	I think if we had a a locating device with the small one , I think that seems way more advanced .
23531	0	a	Yeah .
23532	0	a	I am a away from the base .
23533	0	a	Yeah .
23534	0	a	Yeah .
23535	0	a	Kay so
23536	0	a	The only problem with that is if you forget to take it out of your pocket and it goes in wash .
23537	0	a	That just seems so clunky and
23538	0	a	Okay .
23539	0	a	Yeah ,
23540	0	a	because I mean if even looking at cellphones right now , those trends the smaller the hotter it is ,
23541	0	a	yeah
23542	0	a	Oh .
23543	0	a	Smaller and smaller , yeah ,
23544	0	a	yeah ,
23545	0	a	yeah .
23546	0	a	You are kidding .
23547	0	a	You know it happens .
23548	0	a	Yeah .
23549	0	a	I have had three watches go that way too .
23550	0	a	Oh watches I have but I have never washed a cell phone .
23551	0	a	Ouch .
23552	0	a	A phone , whoa , that would wow , that would hurt .
23553	0	a	Okay , so what kind of material do we want to be made out of ?
23554	0	a	No .
23555	0	a	Pieces everywhere .
23556	0	a	Well , we have lots of options .
23557	0	a	I do not think wood is a viable option .
23558	0	a	Yeah wood .
23559	0	a	Well , titanium s
23560	0	a	I was saying that titanium , if we are being restricted then I would probably lean away from that .
23561	0	a	Oh what did you
23562	0	a	Oh sorry ,
23563	1	a	go ahead .
23564	0	a	Yeah ,
23565	0	a	cause if it is going to cost us more to produce a chip , titanium will be more expensive .
23566	0	a	Right .
23567	0	a	However ,
23568	0	a	well , we only want to sell it for twenty five Euro
23569	0	a	right ?
23570	1	a	Cause I was thinking if we wanted to get the high in market then you could produce a few in titanium ,
23571	0	a	make them a rarity so to speak .
23572	1	a	What would you recommend ?
23573	0	a	Yeah .
23574	0	a	Yeah .
23575	0	a	That will
23576	0	a	Yeah , exactly .
23577	0	a	The selling point , yeah .
23578	0	a	We could do that ,
23579	0	a	because all our research shows that people are definitely willing to spend more if
23580	0	a	Good plan .
23581	0	a	Are we restricted by this ?
23582	0	a	Twenty five Euros
23583	0	a	So you are talking about like when it leaves our salesroom then it is all going to be cherry coloured or is it going to be the kind of thing where people come back and swap it ?
23584	0	a	Okay .
23585	0	a	Yeah .
23586	0	a	Well the original
23587	0	a	Okay .
23588	1	a	I I think we should just focus on one design and one concept right now.
23589	1	a	I am
23590	0	a	not sure that we will have the time and money to produce a whole array of remotes .
23591	1	a	If this was a successful remote , we might then produce a higher end version of it , I think .
23592	0	a	Yeah .
23593	0	a	Good plan .
23594	0	a	Okay , so we want to go for plastic ,
23595	1	a	or what would you recommend for materials ?
23596	0	a	Honestly I would recommend like
23597	1	a	since we are going with batteries instead of solar power , I would recommend maybe a soft like latex , because we could produce , you know how cellphones have those overlays that you can change the colour .
23598	1	a	We could do one that fits in with the trends of the year so ,
23599	0	a	because this year is all fruit ,
23600	0	a	God only knows why ,
23601	1	a	we could do f a cherry cover for this year
23602	0	a	and then i if next year is stripes or solids , you know
23603	1	a	They could come back .
23604	0	a	Oh .
23605	0	a	Yeah , who knows .
23606	0	a	Okay .
23607	1	a	O or we could like take off this .
23608	1	a	They could buy cases , maybe ,
23609	0	a	if they wanted .
23610	1	a	And buy the extra case .
23611	0	a	I think it is good to sell a basic thing and then sell options .
23612	1	a	So we could do like a b a hard base plastic , and then we could give two latex covers to start .
23613	0	a	Yeah .
23614	0	a	The
23615	0	a	what the top face , right ?
23616	0	a	Yeah .
23617	0	a	Yeah .
23618	0	a	Okay .
23619	0	a	Okay .
23620	0	a	Yeah ,
23621	0	a	because the soft latex definitely is squishy .
23622	0	a	That is in .
23623	0	a	Well I mean squishier than like , yeah , just a hard plastic .
23624	0	a	Right .
23625	0	a	Right .
23626	0	a	Okay , and what kind of chip would we need for this guy ?
23627	0	a	I do not think we should do voice ,
23628	1	a	I think we should just do the recognition for when it is lost , you know .
23629	0	a	How complicated
23630	0	a	Are we going to go with the voice activated
23631	1	a	Well , we could give it a specific code , you know , remote missing .
23632	0	a	A tracker , yeah .
23633	0	a	could we
23634	0	a	Yeah .
23635	0	a	Cause that what it type of , yeah ,
23636	0	a	for voice activation would it be like a certain term what we would say like ,
23637	0	a	because people could just be talking and we do not want it going off all the time .
23638	0	a	Right .
23639	0	a	So
23640	0	a	Ooh .
23641	0	a	see I am
23642	0	a	I am strangely attracted to it ,
23643	0	a	because I know that is it is definitely going to be big , because it is , I do not know , it is just so high tech .
23644	0	a	Well , my little sister got for Christmas
23645	0	a	she got one of those key finders that is like a key ring , and you have to whistle in a certain frequency for it to work .
23646	0	a	Yeah , see that would just irritate me .
23647	0	a	And then she would laugh and it would start going off in her purse , and you could not turn it off .
23648	0	a	Oh dear .
23649	0	a	Oh ,
23650	0	a	then maybe voice
23651	0	a	maybe voice activation wo not be good .
23652	0	a	So it became highly irritating .
23653	0	a	Okay .
23654	1	a	So I think having a key phrase is much better .
23655	0	a	Okay .
23656	0	a	Alright .
23657	0	a	But it is not going to be voice activated in the fact that you would say , channel up , and it would work ,
23658	0	a	right ?
23659	0	a	Just a
23660	0	a	Okay , alright .
23661	0	a	Yeah ,
23662	0	a	n n no , we just want it to be a finder .
23663	0	a	But then it
23664	0	a	No .
23665	0	a	Okay .
23666	0	a	But do can your
23667	0	a	can the department make
23668	0	a	Oh , brilliant then .
23669	0	a	That would be like a mid class
23670	0	a	Yeah .
23671	0	a	So we do not actually have to go for
23672	0	a	Well , if they have just developed the sample sensor , sample speaker , it is a brand new chip .
23673	1	a	Why not introduce it in this way ?
23674	0	a	I think , well , we could d r do two
23675	1	a	or we could do one small lithium ,
23676	0	a	cause you know the lithium batteries are doing quite well in most other electronic products , right ?
23677	0	a	So they are more widely available now .
23678	0	a	No .
23679	0	a	Yeah , good point .
23680	0	a	kay .
23681	0	a	and what size batteries , double A , triple A ?
23682	1	a	Two ?
23683	0	a	Could it run off of two
23684	0	a	They are more expensive though , too .
23685	0	a	I think triple A , it will be lighter .
23686	0	a	I mean more more come in a package .
23687	0	a	Well , that depends on what the energy is needed .
23688	0	a	Yeah .
23689	0	a	And they also have a longer battery life than most batteries .
23690	0	a	But if you only have to replace it every five years .
23691	0	a	That is a good point .
23692	0	a	Thoughts anybody ?
23693	0	a	Okay .
23694	0	a	As long as we sell it with it .
23695	1	a	Well , how about a initial , you get one battery when you buy it ,
23696	0	a	cause I am pretty sure we can get them pretty cheap on bulk .
23697	0	a	Right , that is what I meant .
23698	1	a	We could think about it and come back to it next meeting .
23699	0	a	Yeah .
23700	0	a	Yeah .
23701	0	a	We still have one more meeting .
23702	0	a	Alright .
23703	0	a	Okay .
23704	0	a	So we have covered that first category , User Interface Concept ,
23705	0	a	meaning design .
23706	0	a	What is it going to
23707	0	a	Yeah , what is it going to look like .
23708	0	a	Okay .
23709	0	a	I ki I kind of like your idea about the retro phone dial ,
23710	1	a	and that the central button could have , maybe our logo on it ?
23711	1	a	It might be the four way scroll , too .
23712	0	a	Yeah , it could be whatever , as long as there is something big in the middle ,
23713	0	a	because like the old phones , there is like that just like piece of metal or like a picture or something in the middle .
23714	0	a	I mean if
23715	0	a	Yeah .
23716	0	a	Yeah .
23717	0	a	Well , my issue with that is if it got too big though ,
23718	0	a	cause if you have the circle and the button in the middle , then is it going to get wider than your your hands are , because w And then would the buttons be too small if it was enough to fit on it ?
23719	0	a	Yeah .
23720	0	a	Oh , that is true .
23721	0	a	Good point .
23722	0	a	In the sample ones that you showed us there was one that had the scroll buttons on the side ,
23723	1	a	which I think if we make it curved like a hand like a hand shape like if we put the the scroll button on the side ,
23724	0	a	that could be particularly useful .
23725	0	a	Yeah .
23726	0	a	Oh , I see what you mean .
23727	0	a	I think so .
23728	1	a	So scroll buttons on the side and then buttons on top ?
23729	0	a	But we definitely
23730	1	a	If we have scroll things on the side , we definitely have to have them labelled .
23731	0	a	Yeah , I like that .
23732	0	a	Kay .
23733	0	a	Yeah ,
23734	1	a	like on the side of it .
23735	0	a	Well , if it is just up and down
23736	0	a	Volume or channel .
23737	0	a	Oh if it is just up and down .
23738	0	a	But is that for Which ?
23739	0	a	Do we have both sides ?
23740	1	a	Well , the other option is in instead of a scroll you just have the buttons up on the side which are on the side .
23741	0	a	I do not know .
23742	1	a	Well , you could do some on both sides .
23743	0	a	Can we ?
23744	0	a	So that you are just not holding it and it changes the chan
23745	0	a	yeah .
23746	1	a	We should probably make it that you have to depress it to activate it then ,
23747	0	a	cause oth otherwise you are not just holding it and going like this , you know .
23748	0	a	Yeah .
23749	0	a	That is squishy .
23750	0	a	That is squishy .
23751	1	a	have buttons .
23752	0	a	Okay .
23753	0	a	Yeah .
23754	0	a	Yeah , that .
23755	1	a	Kay any other ideas ?
23756	0	a	Oh , yeah .
23757	1	a	what colour ?
23758	0	a	Well I sort of like having the a yellow strip at the bottom with the RR like that .
23759	0	a	Latex covers .
23760	1	a	We have to make sure that logo always sticks out when we put the latex covers on , so we will have to like have a little square or something , so that the our logo is available .
23761	0	a	W
23762	1	a	I think maybe we should do it on a b button itself though ,
23763	0	a	because if people are able to change the covers , I do not know ,
23764	1	a	maybe the on off button , something , some the menu button ,
23765	0	a	I do not know ,
23766	0	a	but you know if we are going to put our company logo on there and somebody could just get another one .
23767	0	a	Yeah .
23768	0	a	And that is at the bottom of it .
23769	1	a	Which button ?
23770	0	a	Yeah .
23771	0	a	Are they all going to have our company logo on them ?
23772	0	a	Every cover ?
23773	0	a	Yeah .
23774	0	a	Yeah , I do not think we should do that , because that would just be icky .
23775	0	a	So I think maybe putting it on a button is probably a good idea .
23776	0	a	If we want it to be visible and
23777	0	a	are all those those one that you showed where they were s met silver metallic looking ?
23778	0	a	But those are plastic , right ?
23779	0	a	They are not titanium .
23780	0	a	Yeah .
23781	0	a	I kind of like that look .
23782	0	a	but , or if it was really
23783	0	a	Yeah , for the base or if we are going for the retro look , I think , like a really shiny black would be cool .
23784	0	a	For our base one ?
23785	0	a	It will wear off .
23786	0	a	Yeah ,
23787	1	a	or like a gun metal grey ,
23788	0	a	cause then it combines the silver and the black .
23789	0	a	What are your thoughts ?
23790	0	a	Gun metal gray .
23791	0	a	There you go , gun metal gray .
23792	0	a	I am just really wary of the putting anything on a button .
23793	0	a	Why ?
23794	0	a	What is the button
23795	0	a	Well , w w then what is the button do , and how do you know that that is what the button does ?
23796	0	a	I guess .
23797	0	a	Yeah , buttons wear off .
23798	0	a	Just looking at examples , y you just do not ever see the logo on a button , it is always on the actual casing .
23799	0	a	Right .
23800	0	a	There is nothing saying that we have to put the logo on the front of the actual
23801	0	a	The only problem is we are using a latex overlay so it actually would go over top of everything and have holes for the buttons ,
23802	1	a	so I was thinking maybe instead of doing that what we could do is leave a space for where the logo should be .
23803	0	a	But we want it to be seen .
23804	0	a	On the back ?
23805	0	a	It d visible
23806	0	a	Visibility though
23807	0	a	Cause if it was only on the back really the only time you are going to see it is when you drop it or when you are changing the battery .
23808	0	a	But you do not
23809	0	a	But , yeah , you do not see it .
23810	0	a	We need it to be seen .
23811	0	a	Well , hang on .
23812	0	a	The other option is , I do not know if you can see it
23813	0	a	but it is like if
23814	0	a	Yeah ,
23815	0	a	it is like the second to last slide .
23816	1	a	I can find it again .
23817	0	a	Okay .
23818	0	a	And yours was called Interface Concept ?
23819	0	a	This one ?
23820	0	a	Well , for some reason I ca not get it to just go to that slide directly .
23821	0	a	Interface , yeah .
23822	0	a	Yeah .
23823	0	a	Okay , it is the very right one .
23824	0	a	You see at the bottom , it is kind of difficult to see , but you have like a d sort of s division between the bottom like , where the logo is , and if we have the replaceable section , it is like the top .
23825	0	a	It does not necessarily replace the entire top .
23826	0	a	And so you have that one piece that stays and the rest just sort of clips in .
23827	0	a	Okay , yes
23828	0	a	yes .
23829	0	a	If c you envisioning it ?
23830	0	a	And so that stays the same when you have the logo , and then you have this s slip that kind of clips in
23831	0	a	and that is the bit that changes .
23832	0	a	Okay .
23833	0	a	Yeah .
23834	0	a	Yeah ,
23835	0	a	yeah .
23836	1	a	Like a little cut out kind of
23837	0	a	Okay .
23838	0	a	Yeah .
23839	0	a	Right .
23840	0	a	That is like , you know , a a cellphone it is like the the screen is always just left opened .
23841	0	a	Right .
23842	1	a	And so , what we are going to do it like bright yellow with the RR ?
23843	1	a	Yellow .
23844	0	a	Yeah .
23845	0	a	Some of tho
23846	0	a	Well , some of those buttons though are blue based .
23847	0	a	Anybody see anything that they liked in these ones ?
23848	0	a	well , a lot of those buttons are blue based .
23849	0	a	Well , kind of .
23850	1	a	and then if v we do have them illuminate upon contact , they could illuminate yellow .
23851	0	a	Yellow , I like that idea .
23852	0	a	Yeah .
23853	0	a	Like if we
23854	0	a	like the one all the way on the left , you ca you can see it on your computer better .
23855	0	a	where the button is actually blue , but the number itself is clear or white or whatever so if you pressed it would illuminate yellow .
23856	1	a	So we would have blue and yellow for the touch buttons .
23857	0	a	Oh , that one .
23858	0	a	I like the yellow illumination idea , very good .
23859	0	a	Yeah .
23860	0	a	Okay .
23861	1	a	Any other ideas or thoughts ?
23862	0	a	We all seem to be fairly in agreement about what we want to do with this project so Kay .
23863	0	a	Ha hang on
23864	1	a	Let me catch up .
23865	0	a	Did we finalise what buttons we are including or we just everything that we said before ?
23866	0	a	Yeah .
23867	0	a	I think there will be time for that later .
23868	0	a	I am guessing .
23869	1	a	Kay , well we are going to wrap this up .
23870	0	a	next meeting is going to start in thirty minutes , and here is what we are each of us going to do .
23871	0	a	The ID is going to do the look and feel design , the UID the user interface design .
23872	0	a	I think you are going to get a lot of , I mean , the final say on what buttons get put We will all talk about it , but I think , that is pretty much what you are going to do ,
23873	0	a	right ?
23874	0	a	I guess .
23875	0	a	Kay .
23876	0	a	And you are going to do some product evaluation .
23877	0	a	Okay , and right now , the ID and UID , you two are going to work together on a prototype using modelling clay .
23878	0	a	Great .
23879	0	a	Play Doh .
23880	0	a	Yeah .
23881	0	a	Okay , and you should all be getting an email pretty soon .
23882	0	a	Alright .
23883	0	a	Wonderful
23884	0	a	 
23885	0	a	I want to find our if our remote works .
23886	0	a	Me too .
23887	0	a	Oh .
23888	0	a	Okay .
23889	0	a	Whoohoo .
23890	0	a	here is the agenda for our last meeting .
23891	0	a	after the opening we are going to have a prototype presentation , then we are going to discuss the evaluation criteria and the financing of our remote .
23892	0	a	Then we are going to evaluate the product
23893	0	a	and I think the whole production process , and then we are going to close it up , and we have forty minutes ,
23894	1	a	so let is get started .
23895	0	a	Oh , no ,
23896	1	a	let is have the prototype presentation .
23897	0	a	kay ,
23898	0	a	you ready ?
23899	1	a	Y you read that stuff , since you wrote it .
23900	0	a	sure .
23901	1	a	You or me ?
23902	0	a	Okay .
23903	1	a	Well , since our materials are not exactly what we were going for , I am just going to translate what this all means for you .
23904	1	a	I will be the Vanna .
23905	0	a	The base is going to be gunmetal gray , which is what we had decided , and it is going to be plastic .
23906	0	a	then there is the latex cover , which is what you see as red .
23907	0	a	because it can be replaceable , we just kind of went with the colour .
23908	0	a	Right .
23909	0	a	and then the buttons are actually kind of poking through rather than on top .
23910	0	a	and the buttons will be a l much lighter blue , almost see through .
23911	0	a	It is just sort of a very pale blue and a light up yellow .
23912	0	a	That is nice .
23913	0	a	Yeah .
23914	0	a	The whole thing lights up if you press any button , rather than it just that one button will light up .
23915	0	a	Good .
23916	0	a	and then at the bottom we have our logo .
23917	0	a	bright yellow sort of design with the RR which will actually look like our logo .
23918	0	a	Great .
23919	0	a	And then on the side you have the buttons .
23920	0	a	They are one button , but they kind of push up and down .
23921	0	a	Okay .
23922	0	a	I do not think they are scrolling .
23923	0	a	No .
23924	0	a	They are just buttons .
23925	0	a	Right
23926	0	a	, yeah .
23927	0	a	And then
23928	0	a	yeah , the buttons .
23929	0	a	On off switch will be here and as you have noticed on our prototype they have ended up with a curvature kind of , by concave sort of thing , except for , you know , ca not see underneath .
23930	0	a	Yeah .
23931	0	a	So I am hoping that when we get to production we can actually make them like that ,
23932	0	a	because they are very nice to stock you know , stick your finger in .
23933	0	a	Yeah .
23934	0	a	the two squared buttons are are two probably least used , menu , mute , and then these are the numbers , so our channel and our volume will be on either side .
23935	0	a	Thumb shaped .
23936	0	a	Yeah .
23937	0	a	And then the last thing is just that it will be black labelling on top , just which we did not do .
23938	0	a	Okay .
23939	0	a	And did you determine the curvature of the bottom part of it for the hand , is it going to be a single or a double ?
23940	0	a	Single .
23941	0	a	I would say a single .
23942	0	a	Single .
23943	0	a	Single sounds good ,
23944	0	a	cause it is not big enough to really constitute a double .
23945	0	a	Yeah .
23946	0	a	Right .
23947	0	a	Yeah ,
23948	0	a	it is only actually the size of my hand .
23949	0	a	Great .
23950	0	a	Great .
23951	0	a	I think you did an awesome job .
23952	0	a	Yeah , I think it is a beautiful Yeah .
23953	0	a	It is beautiful , and it is everything that we discussed .
23954	0	a	Good job , you guys .
23955	0	a	Good job .
23956	0	a	Oh thank you .
23957	0	a	Whoohoo .
23958	0	a	Those are really good .
23959	0	a	Alright
23960	0	a	what is next in our agenda ?
23961	0	a	we are going to discuss the evaluation criteria , and that is with Courtney .
23962	0	a	Okay ,
23963	0	a	it is a PowerPoint presentation .
23964	0	a	I do not really know exactly what we should talk about .
23965	0	a	It is under evaluation .
23966	0	a	Right .
23967	0	a	Alright .
23968	0	a	so these are the criteria we are going to ask , is it easy to use , is it fashionable
23969	1	a	yeah ,
23970	1	a	I guess we should write these down so we can reference them .
23971	0	a	Feel good meaning what ?
23972	0	a	Physically ,
23973	0	a	okay .
23974	0	a	Like does it feel good , like yeah , physically .
23975	0	a	Right .
23976	0	a	Sqi
23977	0	a	Right .
23978	0	a	That is just for current trend .
23979	0	a	It does not really count , you guys .
23980	0	a	Yeah , it was a little difficult to incorporate the cover with the cherry fruit on it .
23981	0	a	Yeah .
23982	0	a	But it is
23983	0	a	so we do have removable covers , right ?
23984	0	a	Yeah , well then that is covered .
23985	0	a	Right .
23986	0	a	Yes .
23987	0	a	And so we n k
23988	0	a	everybody have that ?
23989	0	a	Yeah , she is got it .
23990	0	a	Kay .
23991	1	a	I will wait .
23992	0	a	It is good .
23993	0	a	Yeah .
23994	0	a	Yeah .
23995	0	a	Okay so , we are using the criteria for a seven point scale , and so we need to discuss how we feel .
23996	0	a	It falls within this range , so for easy to use ,
23997	0	a	do we feel it is very easy to use ?
23998	0	a	You guys
23999	0	a	Okay .
24000	0	a	Are we going to indi
24001	1	a	I say we individually rate
24002	0	a	what do you say ?
24003	1	a	Just orally .
24004	0	a	True or false , easy to use .
24005	0	a	Yeah .
24006	0	a	Why not ?
24007	0	a	We have
24008	0	a	okay .
24009	0	a	easy to use .
24010	0	a	I vote six .
24011	0	a	Oh wait , that is false .
24012	0	a	Oh , two .
24013	0	a	Okay .
24014	0	a	I would say two as well .
24015	0	a	Yeah , two .
24016	0	a	Two .
24017	0	a	hello , we are great .
24018	0	a	That is what I say .
24019	0	a	Okay , fashionable ?
24020	0	a	No .
24021	0	a	one .
24022	0	a	At the moment , no .
24023	0	a	No .
24024	0	a	I mean like no , I think it is very fashionable .
24025	0	a	Me too , very chic .
24026	0	a	I thi I would give it a one .
24027	0	a	Okay .
24028	0	a	One , I give it a one .
24029	0	a	I will give it a two , because at the moment it is not looking that way .
24030	0	a	Well , that is that is just like that is a clay , it is a prototype .
24031	0	a	Oh , and ma it is a prototype , right .
24032	0	a	What do you think ?
24033	0	a	Okay .
24034	0	a	I do not think it is that fashionable .
24035	0	a	I would give it like three or four .
24036	0	a	Well , now I am .
24037	0	a	So , the average is about a two .
24038	0	a	Yeah , it is a two .
24039	0	a	But then I am not fashionable , so
24040	1	a	do not use my opinion .
24041	0	a	Two or three .
24042	0	a	Two point five .
24043	0	a	That is okay .
24044	0	a	Yeah .
24045	0	a	Neither are all o all the customers we have , either .
24046	0	a	does it feel good ?
24047	0	a	I feel like
24048	0	a	I think it feels good .
24049	1	a	Imagine ,
24050	0	a	since we obviously do not have that .
24051	0	a	Does it feel good ?
24052	0	a	Yeah ,
24053	0	a	it is going to be thicker .
24054	0	a	the shape of it actually does .
24055	0	a	And it is i it is very ergonomically designed .
24056	0	a	It is going to be curved .
24057	0	a	Yeah .
24058	0	a	Depth .
24059	0	a	I think so too .
24060	0	a	I will give it a two .
24061	0	a	Kay .
24062	0	a	Two .
24063	0	a	I will give it a one .
24064	0	a	What do you say ?
24065	0	a	Okay .
24066	0	a	I would say a two .
24067	0	a	Alright , average is two .
24068	0	a	Is it technologically innovative ?
24069	0	a	Oh sorry I am taking over your job here .
24070	0	a	Oh no , it is fine ,
24071	0	a	you are I mean you are Project Manager .
24072	1	a	Go right ahead .
24073	0	a	yeah ,
24074	0	a	I mean and it
24075	0	a	does it have voice
24076	0	a	I mean the phrase recognition on it ?
24077	0	a	And there is no way you can represent it on here .
24078	0	a	Yes .
24079	0	a	Right ?
24080	0	a	We were able to do it with that kind of chip .
24081	0	a	Oh right ,
24082	0	a	the
24083	0	a	Right .
24084	0	a	We could do it with the chip , yes .
24085	0	a	It was not
24086	0	a	we have no reflection of it on the prototype , but that is because it is only two dimensions , really .
24087	0	a	Yeah , right .
24088	0	a	Y
24089	0	a	Yeah , so .
24090	0	a	That was
24091	0	a	kay .
24092	0	a	And we discussed that being included .
24093	0	a	Then yes ,
24094	0	a	then I would
24095	0	a	well it is not
24096	0	a	what else would it need for it to be technologically innovative ?
24097	0	a	And it does not cover anything other then TV ,
24098	0	a	so I would probably give it a three .
24099	0	a	It
24100	0	a	Yeah .
24101	0	a	Well we do not have the you know , we ca not say channel , and it changes the channel , channel eight .
24102	0	a	Right .
24103	0	a	Okay .
24104	0	a	Even though it is for just a TV remote it is very advanced .
24105	0	a	But it is just a TV remote .
24106	0	a	Yeah .
24107	0	a	I would go for a three or four on that one , so okay ,
24108	1	a	let is go for a three point five .
24109	0	a	Yeah I go four .
24110	0	a	Three and an half .
24111	0	a	Alright , and the last criteria is it is it
24112	0	a	Well , we have covered that with the
24113	0	a	trendy .
24114	0	a	Squishy and fruity .
24115	0	a	Well yeah , so I would give it a two .
24116	0	a	It is just trendy , basically .
24117	0	a	It is capable of being squishy and fruity .
24118	0	a	Sure .
24119	0	a	Capable .
24120	0	a	Oh , it is very capable of being squishy and fruity .
24121	0	a	Very capable .
24122	0	a	Okay .
24123	0	a	And it is very important .
24124	0	a	Yeah .
24125	0	a	Kay , there we go .
24126	0	a	Okay , next .
24127	0	a	So .
24128	0	a	Next .
24129	0	a	So our re model slightly resembling a giant delicious cookie appears to be a winner ,
24130	0	a	and hopefully we will sell millions .
24131	0	a	Good job , team .
24132	0	a	How did you get that in there ?
24133	0	a	The slightly resembling a giant delicious cookie .
24134	0	a	What ?
24135	0	a	It it does .
24136	0	a	It does .
24137	0	a	That was good .
24138	0	a	Thanks .
24139	0	a	Very good .
24140	1	a	Alright , let is go back to this
24141	0	a	No , that is it .
24142	0	a	Oops .
24143	0	a	Okay , so now we are moving on to finance ,
24144	0	a	okay .
24145	0	a	I am going to show you an Excel spreadsheet and we are going to fill it in together based on what components we are including in our remote and see if it is under twelve fifty Euro .
24146	0	a	If so , we can proceed , if not , we need to go back to the drawing board a little bit .
24147	1	a	Kay ?
24148	1	a	So let me bring that up .
24149	0	a	Here we go .
24150	0	a	Alright .
24151	0	a	it is not hand dynamo , it is powered by battery , so we give it a Number of components you plan to use .
24152	0	a	Yep .
24153	0	a	Two .
24154	0	a	Do I just put quantity being one battery , or
24155	0	a	Yeah .
24156	0	a	Yeah .
24157	0	a	kay .
24158	0	a	But if it is a
24159	0	a	do you want to go for
24160	1	a	this is where we need to make a final call on if it is a lithium or do we want to go triple As ,
24161	0	a	cause triple As we are going to have t do more than one battery .
24162	1	a	Oh , let is just go for a lithium .
24163	0	a	What do you say ?
24164	0	a	I think
24165	0	a	I think the people who purchase this are going to be technologically
24166	0	a	right .
24167	0	a	Yeah , let is let is do a lithium .
24168	0	a	Yeah ,
24169	0	a	it is .
24170	0	a	We are gon that is gon
24171	0	a	Nologically advanced ,
24172	0	a	yeah .
24173	0	a	Okay , down to the electronics section .
24174	0	a	We are going to need this kind , correct , if we do the voice sensor ,
24175	0	a	so one of those .
24176	0	a	Yeah .
24177	0	a	Yep .
24178	0	a	It is a single curved , so one of those .
24179	0	a	Oh .
24180	0	a	What is that ?
24181	0	a	Yeah , that is correct .
24182	0	a	Yeah .
24183	0	a	Kay , down here , case material .
24184	0	a	It is plastic .
24185	0	a	We
24186	0	a	plastic .
24187	0	a	Plastic .
24188	0	a	And special colour .
24189	0	a	And special colour .
24190	0	a	Kay .
24191	0	a	Down here , interface type .
24192	0	a	We are going to have the integrated scroll scroll wheel .
24193	0	a	No , we do not have the scroll .
24194	0	a	Is not
24195	0	a	oh those are just regular buttons .
24196	0	a	But it is
24197	0	a	Yeah ,
24198	0	a	but i
24199	0	a	so i
24200	0	a	But will we w actually we will need two ,
24201	0	a	wo not we ?
24202	0	a	One for the top and then one for the s one e for each side .
24203	0	a	Well , that is the push button too , right there .
24204	0	a	Buttons .
24205	0	a	This ?
24206	0	a	Okay ,
24207	0	a	so we can just go .
24208	0	a	Integrated scroll wheel or push button .
24209	0	a	We are really having just push button interface .
24210	0	a	But it that just covers the type of button we are having .
24211	0	a	Because we are not doing a scroll on the side , it is still push button .
24212	0	a	Oh like the twenty nine means like you have both scrolls and
24213	0	a	push buttons .
24214	0	a	Push button .
24215	0	a	Okay .
24216	0	a	Right I think she is
24217	0	a	I think what Courtney is talking about is do we need to put two here ?
24218	0	a	Right .
24219	0	a	But we just have push
24220	0	a	Yeah .
24221	0	a	But we do not have any scrolls .
24222	0	a	Like because there is like one interface right here and then because it is not going to be on the same plane when you press the button .
24223	0	a	There is going to have to be additional signals on the sides .
24224	0	a	So is that going to be an extra one on each side ?
24225	0	a	Or three ,
24226	0	a	because of one on each side and one on top .
24227	0	a	Okay .
24228	0	a	I do not know ,
24229	0	a	they might put us well , let is just .
24230	0	a	Two interfaces ,
24231	0	a	is that what w should we s say ?
24232	0	a	Okay , fine .
24233	0	a	Let is call it th
24234	0	a	Okay .
24235	0	a	Two or would it be three ?
24236	0	a	Okay
24237	0	a	and we are going to
24238	0	a	button supplements the buttons are no
24239	0	a	okay .
24240	0	a	Yeah .
24241	0	a	I mean it is fine cause it comes out the same as twenty nine .
24242	0	a	Well less than twenty nine even .
24243	0	a	They are a special colour .
24244	0	a	they are they are a special form , cause they are indented .
24245	0	a	Are they ?
24246	0	a	Oh , right .
24247	0	a	And then s
24248	0	a	yeah .
24249	0	a	And , they are a special material .
24250	0	a	Well , we are under cost then .
24251	0	a	Alright .
24252	0	a	We are over ?
24253	0	a	Okay .
24254	0	a	No , we are under .
24255	0	a	Grand .
24256	0	a	We are under .
24257	0	a	Twelve point five is our limit .
24258	0	a	Oh , I see .
24259	0	a	We have got eleven point two .
24260	0	a	So we can go to production .
24261	0	a	Alright .
24262	0	a	We can go to
24263	0	a	I dunno what I just did .
24264	0	a	Okay .
24265	0	a	Now we are going to talk about the project process and whether or not we are satisfied with the whole process and the result .
24266	0	a	did we have a lot of room for creativity ?
24267	0	a	Did we have a lot of room for individual leadership , teamwork , and the means , meaning the technology that we used to produce our little guy there , and if we found any new ideas .
24268	1	a	Now , question is , how do we do this ?
24269	0	a	Discuss , sure .
24270	1	a	Go back .
24271	0	a	I think we just discuss it .
24272	0	a	Previous .
24273	0	a	Alright .
24274	1	a	Who want who would like to go first ?
24275	0	a	We think we got stifled for cri creativity by the company itself , in restricting us only to using a TV remote , initially .
24276	0	a	We did not have a whiteboard .
24277	0	a	Yeah .
24278	0	a	Oh that is true .
24279	0	a	And no internet .
24280	0	a	Yeah .
24281	0	a	No ,
24282	0	a	yeah , that is a good point .
24283	0	a	Cause I would forgotten that that was not our decision , yeah .
24284	0	a	And how did you feel about the whole the whole process though ?
24285	0	a	Right , and we got say over what how technologically advanced it should be and also how fashionable , which I kind of like
24286	0	a	we
24287	0	a	yep .
24288	0	a	Oh , overall I mean I thought we did a good job like
24289	0	a	We got to choose basically we had control over
24290	0	a	minus it being just merely a TV remote we got to choose what we wanted to do with it .
24291	0	a	And we are a fashion forward technology company .
24292	0	a	You know it .
24293	0	a	right .
24294	0	a	what about the teamwork aspect ?
24295	0	a	How did you guys enjoy making the model , the prototype ?
24296	0	a	I think you did .
24297	0	a	I think we did well .
24298	0	a	Yeah .
24299	0	a	Did you work well together in there , and
24300	0	a	kay .
24301	0	a	Yep .
24302	0	a	Well , no , there was there was scratching and fighting , but no .
24303	0	a	Minus that one fight .
24304	0	a	Yeah .
24305	0	a	Oh my God ,
24306	0	a	and we have all been a pretty congenial team here , I think .
24307	0	a	Gouges .
24308	0	a	Yeah .
24309	0	a	We had not had any ma fallings out .
24310	0	a	I mean minus you guys being wha what is it , the survey , annoying or what is it ?
24311	0	a	Irritating , yeah .
24312	0	a	Irritating .
24313	0	a	Irritating .
24314	0	a	Irritating .
24315	0	a	Wow that is a it is definitely a strong one .
24316	0	a	Okay .
24317	0	a	The means , the whiteboard did not work .
24318	0	a	And no internet .
24319	0	a	Yeah .
24320	0	a	Yeah .
24321	1	a	I have to knock that one down a couple notches .
24322	0	a	Yeah , and no internet .
24323	0	a	A and our friend here really feels strongly about the internet .
24324	0	a	Misses .
24325	0	a	I do .
24326	0	a	And the digital the digital pens
24327	0	a	were
24328	0	a	they were pretty cool .
24329	0	a	There is so much available .
24330	0	a	Like it is information
24331	0	a	Yeah .
24332	0	a	Yeah , digital pens .
24333	0	a	I really appreciated those , yeah .
24334	0	a	They were fine .
24335	0	a	Yeah they were fun , even though I am not really sure what I could do with them , but they are awesome .
24336	0	a	The use of the laptops for receiving everything .
24337	0	a	It was wireless too , so .
24338	0	a	Yeah .
24339	0	a	Right , laptops are extremely handy , wireless .
24340	0	a	And these things whoa .
24341	0	a	And that we have a shared network where we can put all of the Big brother .
24342	0	a	And let is not forget the sexy dual microphones everyone gets to wear .
24343	0	a	Yeah .
24344	0	a	And Big Brother .
24345	0	a	Yeah .
24346	0	a	Kay , have we found any new ideas through this process ?
24347	0	a	For something that looks cool and also has what I want it to b do technologically .
24348	0	a	we are really going to sell this .
24349	0	a	Ta da .
24350	0	a	Yeah .
24351	0	a	And that is your right brain taking over , w wanting the artistic , the fashionable , the hip , you know .
24352	0	a	If we all just went out and bought useful things , I do not think I mean that is not what technology .
24353	0	a	Well , that is why I do not like Macs or Apples ,
24354	0	a	just cause I look at it , and I know it is probably a very good computer , but I look at it , and I am taken back to elementary school , cause they look the same .
24355	0	a	They look like they did when I was in elementary school ,
24356	0	a	and that is so old fashioned to me .
24357	0	a	Yeah .
24358	0	a	Yeah , cause they are pretty
24359	0	a	and just like
24360	0	a	yeah .
24361	0	a	The Toronto district school would only use his Macs with their kids .
24362	0	a	Yeah .
24363	0	a	Exactly , so I associate them with like really low tech , really cheap , bad
24364	0	a	Yeah .
24365	0	a	Yeah .
24366	0	a	Just the Mac font bothers me even .
24367	0	a	But I do like iPods ,
24368	0	a	go figure .
24369	0	a	Yeah , no , iPods
24370	0	a	They want all those words for presentation , even the plugs .
24371	0	a	Yeah .
24372	0	a	Well , i iPods are now quite trendy , and they come in different colours .
24373	0	a	Colours .
24374	0	a	Exactly .
24375	0	a	Yeah .
24376	0	a	I mean how many people went out and bough a Nokia phone , back when we were like in high school , just so they could get the changeable face plates .
24377	0	a	Oh yeah , everybody .
24378	0	a	Okay .
24379	0	a	Anyway , so that is definitely at work .
24380	0	a	Not me .
24381	0	a	Mine is amber .
24382	0	a	But the my
24383	0	a	but my one issue is just like the whole it is for TV only .
24384	0	a	I did not have a phone until university .
24385	0	a	Oh .
24386	0	a	I was like who is going to buy a remote just for the TV unless they have lost theirs .
24387	1	a	Look at it .
24388	0	a	Yeah .
24389	0	a	That is a piece of work .
24390	0	a	Fashionable chic people will .
24391	0	a	You are kidding .
24392	0	a	Wow .
24393	0	a	No , no .
24394	0	a	Marketing Director says yeah .
24395	0	a	Fashionable people will buy it .
24396	0	a	No , marketing has to actually create the desire for it .
24397	1	a	Oh , I will create desire .
24398	0	a	That is okay .
24399	0	a	We can create a commercial where they think that all their needs will be met .
24400	0	a	This will help them find the one .
24401	0	a	Ri They will be sexy with it .
24402	0	a	We could have like an Adam and Eve type commercial , and that is the fig leaf .
24403	0	a	That is right .
24404	0	a	Oh right .
24405	0	a	That will sell .
24406	0	a	There you go , marketing .
24407	0	a	Let you loose .
24408	0	a	And so the serpent says , use our remote .
24409	0	a	Yeah .
24410	0	a	Alright .
24411	0	a	Yeah , no .
24412	0	a	Yeah .
24413	1	a	Okay , we are going to wrap this up now .
24414	0	a	the costs are within the budget , we evaluated the project , and now we are going to complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary , and then we are going to have a big giant party , apparently , according to this , so .
24415	0	a	Whoohoo .

24443	0	a	I am Stephanie and I am the User Interface Designer .
24444	0	a	I am Krista and I am the Industrial Designer .
24445	0	a	Okay .
24446	0	a	so f here is our agenda for today .
24447	0	a	we are going to do some tool training , project plan and discuss then close .
24448	0	a	so .
24449	0	a	So our aim is to produce a remote control that is original , trendy and user friendly .
24450	0	a	And to do this , we have to there is certain things we have to consider about functional aspects and conceptual design of the thing .
24451	0	a	So .
24452	0	a	We will get to that .
24453	0	a	Oh there it is .
24454	0	a	Right .
24455	0	a	Functional design , conceptual design and detailed design .
24456	0	a	So throughout our next couple of meetings we will we will be covering these things .
24457	0	a	so we are going to try out our white board .
24458	0	a	If we will all draw our favourite animal , to sum up the characteristics of that animal .
24459	0	a	So you want us to draw it and then talk about it ?
24460	0	a	Or just draw it ?
24461	0	a	Okay .
24462	0	a	Okay .
24463	0	a	I think both .
24464	0	a	Yeah .
24465	0	a	Why do not we do both .
24466	0	a	Both .
24467	0	a	Yeah .
24468	0	a	Who starts ?
24469	1	a	We ought to decide who starts and all that .
24470	0	a	Right .
24471	0	a	No ?
24472	0	a	Uh huh .
24473	1	a	Any volunteers ?
24474	1	a	Does anyone know what they want to draw ?
24475	0	a	I do not think so .
24476	1	a	, I gotta think about it for a second like .
24477	0	a	Does it have to be functional , trendy and user friendly ?
24478	1	a	Okay , I will draw .
24479	1	a	I will draw one .
24480	0	a	Make sure my things here .
24481	0	a	Uh oh .
24482	0	a	Right .
24483	0	a	Okay , my favourite animal is
24484	0	a	see .
24485	0	a	Oops .
24486	0	a	A dolphin .
24487	0	a	Yeah , it is
24488	0	a	Yeah , I guess it has a fin on top too , yeah .
24489	0	a	Is like playing Pictionary .
24490	0	a	It is my dolphin .
24491	0	a	So what characteristics do you like about your animal ?
24492	0	a	They are graceful .
24493	0	a	I like its tail .
24494	0	a	, no , I think dolphins are really I dunno , they are smart and
24495	0	a	they they are cute and they like swimming and that is cool , like
24496	0	a	they are graceful
24497	0	a	yeah ,
24498	0	a	and they are so
24499	0	a	Yeah they are sleek
24500	0	a	and they look intelligent
24501	0	a	and I do not know , they are
24502	0	a	I guess it is the whole like binocular vision thing .
24503	0	a	Sleek .
24504	0	a	I do not know how intelligent that one looks .
24505	0	a	Yeah he he does not look that smart .
24506	0	a	He is a I dunno they are
24507	0	a	I think it is cool the the the interaction
24508	0	a	that or the th things that the reasons people seem to like you know you get ex
24509	0	a	you know people are sitting on the beach and
24510	0	a	p they are like
24511	0	a	oh look
24512	0	a	there is dolphins and it is kind of like
24513	0	a	but they are
24514	0	a	you know they jump around in the water
24515	0	a	and they are happy
24516	0	a	and they are mammals , but they swim .
24517	0	a	Yes .
24518	1	a	Does anybody else want to draw their animal ?
24519	1	a	Suppose I can draw an animal , yeah .
24520	0	a	Uh oh there goes the ten .
24521	0	a	It is a cat .
24522	0	a	Yeah .
24523	0	a	I do not know .
24524	0	a	They sleep all day , they are easy to draw .
24525	1	a	Do you want to anything ?
24526	0	a	I dunno if the the
24527	1	a	yeah .
24528	0	a	Well I had the cat as well , but I have got a spare one .
24529	0	a	I think the pen is running out of
24530	0	a	Two million .
24531	1	a	So I will use the spare one .
24532	0	a	but it is harder to draw .
24533	0	a	And the pen is dying .
24534	0	a	A horse .
24535	0	a	Horse .
24536	0	a	I do not really know how the legs go ,
24537	1	a	but anyway I will do that .
24538	0	a	That is very good .
24539	0	a	, and the main reason is they are pretty .
24540	0	a	I think they are very pretty and they go well with the environment , and I like the way they run
24541	0	a	and I used to do horse riding
24542	0	a	and they are just very sort of sturdy and nice animals .
24543	0	a	And I like the way they feel
24544	0	a	, sort of under under the hand , I think that is pretty much it .
24545	0	a	How many should we sell then ?
24546	0	a	, a lot , two two two million , two mi
24547	0	a	no , more f four million .
24548	0	a	Yeah .
24549	0	a	This cord is
24550	0	a	Right .
24551	0	a	Actually I have not thought of anything yet .
24552	0	a	It is a pig .
24553	0	a	So I am thinking we should design a remote control that is water resistant , strong and furry .
24554	0	a	What do you think , yeah ?
24555	0	a	This is
24556	0	a	yeah , well like a cat , you know , soft
24557	0	a	yeah .
24558	0	a	And furry .
24559	0	a	Textile tactile , tactile remote control .
24560	0	a	Although
24561	0	a	I will just put there .
24562	0	a	Right .
24563	0	a	You are dragging a you have a tail .
24564	0	a	Oh my gosh , this is disastrous .
24565	0	a	Sorry about that .
24566	0	a	Okay .
24567	0	a	So moving on .
24568	0	a	Our selling price goal is twenty five Euro and profit aim is fifty million Euro .
24569	0	a	So I am guessing that we are not actually in Scotland , we are in some European country .
24570	0	a	, and we will hope to sell this internationally .
24571	0	a	Sorry can you just say that what is the what are our price goals again ?
24572	0	a	Okay .
24573	0	a	selling price is twenty five Euro .
24574	0	a	Profit aim fifty million Euro .
24575	0	a	Anyone a mathematician ?
24576	0	a	So f that is a fifty percent .
24577	0	a	Four million .
24578	0	a	And it
24579	0	a	well it is the profit so if a profit for each is twelve fifty , that will do four million .
24580	0	a	Oh , yeah .
24581	0	a	It is a lot .
24582	0	a	, I do not know what these mean because I did not actually make the slide show .
24583	0	a	Experience with remote control .
24584	1	a	So I guess we have to reflect on our experiences with remote controls to decide what we would like to see in a convenient , practical , nice remote control .
24585	1	a	so do we have any initial ideas for how this remote control should be designed or formatted or the the buttons it should have .
24586	1	a	, I think one thing is that it should be easy to find
24587	0	a	bec yeah bec
24588	0	a	Yeah ,
24589	0	a	yeah
24590	0	a	yeah
24591	0	a	yeah
24592	0	a	yeah .
24593	0	a	I was thinking that too .
24594	0	a	Yeah .
24595	0	a	I think we should design something that has like a
24596	0	a	so you can like somehow like you
24597	1	a	I mean you always know where your TV is , so just have a call button ,
24598	0	a	I have always wanted that ,
24599	1	a	so like you can push a button on your TV
24600	0	a	Yeah ,
24601	0	a	yeah
24602	0	a	yeah
24603	0	a	yeah ,
24604	1	a	so you should have a call button on your television to be able to find your remote control .
24605	0	a	Yeah .
24606	0	a	I mean you have it for the portable phone , so why not
24607	0	a	yeah .
24608	0	a	Yeah .
24609	1	a	And even I think a little light .
24610	1	a	or even a maybe a vib a vibrating thing .
24611	0	a	I dunno but someth because it is usually under the sofa .
24612	0	a	Yeah .
24613	0	a	In which case you are going to be l
24614	0	a	but if it has a sort of signal which is not any sound I do not know if it is expensive maybe to
24615	0	a	Maybe call is enough .
24616	0	a	Yeah .
24617	0	a	Yeah .
24618	0	a	I do not
24619	0	a	yeah
24620	0	a	I mean it
24621	0	a	but like
24622	0	a	I mean
24623	0	a	just I mean like your phone even just has so like it can vibrate , it can light up and make noise
24624	0	a	and I dunno
24625	0	a	But yeah .
24626	0	a	Yeah
24627	0	a	yeah
24628	0	a	yeah .
24629	0	a	Yeah .
24630	1	a	What if it had something like just like a magnet on the back of it
24631	0	a	and you could
24632	0	a	I mean j just to have some place to put it besides like a base .
24633	0	a	Yeah .
24634	0	a	You know like a portable phone has a base , like just to have a home for it .
24635	0	a	Yeah ,
24636	0	a	or if it had a
24637	0	a	yeah .
24638	0	a	Yeah
24639	0	a	yeah
24640	0	a	yeah
24641	0	a	yeah .
24642	0	a	Yeah ,
24643	0	a	I mean
24644	0	a	Yeah .
24645	0	a	Cause people just stick it on top of their TV , but the point of having a remote is not to have to walk over to the TV , so
24646	0	a	Yeah .
24647	0	a	Well that is why it is always in the couch .
24648	0	a	Yeah , in in the couch .
24649	0	a	I dunno , it seems like though that that would be hard , cause you not you are not going to be lazy anyway and
24650	0	a	Yeah so we the project is now couches and remote controls .
24651	0	a	Yeah .
24652	0	a	Maybe we should design couches that have the remote control in the side arm .
24653	1	a	But even just a thing to attach it to the w you know if you had a thing , a pretty object attached to the wall .
24654	0	a	But that would really make it more expensive .
24655	0	a	Yeah .
24656	0	a	But it is only a plastic thing , r really , the thing on the wall .
24657	0	a	Yeah .
24658	0	a	Yeah .
24659	0	a	Something like that .
24660	0	a	And the other thing is
24661	0	a	Not
24662	1	a	well it needs to be sort of
24663	0	a	Yeah .
24664	0	a	Do you think it needs to be bigger to not lose , or does that not factor in ?
24665	0	a	Like Hand
24666	0	a	hand held size , yeah .
24667	0	a	Bigger .
24668	0	a	Hand sized .
24669	0	a	I do not think you need a
24670	0	a	But definitely not well I do not know .
24671	0	a	Not not huge , but
24672	0	a	Huh .
24673	0	a	It ca not be that hard to put some kind of a noise on it .
24674	0	a	No , it ca not be , uh uh .
24675	0	a	No it really would not be .
24676	1	a	Or like or like a light thing .
24677	0	a	You know .
24678	0	a	I dunno
24679	1	a	Like spaceship .
24680	0	a	Yeah .
24681	0	a	Oh dear .
24682	0	a	Or make it mobile so it runs around and comes come find you
24683	0	a	yeah .
24684	0	a	That would be really
24685	0	a	I am sure we could do that for twenty five Euros a pop .
24686	0	a	Little homing device .
24687	0	a	Yeah .
24688	0	a	Okay .
24689	0	a	So what do we think this remote control should
24690	0	a	Five minutes .
24691	0	a	Till the meeting
24692	0	a	oh right .
24693	0	a	This is what we have left .
24694	1	a	I also think though that it should not have too many buttons ,
24695	0	a	cause I hate that when they have too many buttons and
24696	0	a	I mean I know it has to have enough functions
24697	0	a	but like , I do not know you ,
24698	0	a	just have like eight thousand buttons and you are like ,
24699	0	a	no , you never use half of them .
24700	0	a	, oh we just
24701	0	a	Yeah .
24702	0	a	Yeah , I agree .
24703	0	a	B button and the F button , they do not do anything .
24704	0	a	Yeah ,
24705	0	a	yeah
24706	0	a	yeah .
24707	0	a	You
24708	0	a	what if may be a little fancy
24709	1	a	but what if it had like a little screen , so it has less buttons but it still has all the functions .
24710	0	a	So .
24711	0	a	That would be cool .
24712	0	a	Like the way a mobile phone does .
24713	0	a	Yeah .
24714	0	a	Yeah .
24715	0	a	I mean it just seems like
24716	0	a	yeah .
24717	0	a	So you could like like if you have I dunno if you have satellite if you have a hundred channels
24718	0	a	, you can the way you do it on your radio is that you
24719	0	a	what do you call it
24720	0	a	s y
24721	0	a	yeah
24722	0	a	but you can programme ,
24723	1	a	so you can programme like your favourite channels ,
24724	0	a	so like if you had a s
24725	1	a	That is something we could decide .
24726	0	a	Select .
24727	1	a	But , would you have the screen on the thing , or would you have it on the telly transmitting the screen .
24728	0	a	I guess they would go together somehow ?
24729	0	a	I dunno .
24730	0	a	Because
24731	0	a	Because , I do not know if it is
24732	0	a	I think it is e expensive ,
24733	0	a	if you have
24734	1	a	if you use the telly screen , cause the telly is already a screen , then you can pro sort of have a programming function , really easy sort of arrow up and down , on the remote , and then use the telly as a screen .
24735	0	a	Yeah .
24736	0	a	Yeah .
24737	0	a	Right .
24738	0	a	But
24739	0	a	But yeah for sure .
24740	0	a	I am thinking kind of
24741	0	a	Or like you h you see those you know people I am thinking of like celebrity cribs kind of things when like they have all those these things that at their house you know their their entire house is so electronic , and they have like this one master control that and it is like a hand held like turns on everything sort of control and it has like a screen and like
24742	0	a	so I think it should be possible to have some kind of a screen ,
24743	0	a	I do not know if it must be it would probably
24744	0	a	must be ex too expensive though t like I dunno .
24745	0	a	Something like not it is not on the button but it is telling you what to do ,
24746	0	a	is that what you mean ?
24747	0	a	Right .
24748	0	a	Yeah .
24749	0	a	Yeah .
24750	0	a	Yeah .
24751	0	a	But like mobile phones have screens and they are cheap .
24752	0	a	Yeah ,
24753	0	a	yeah .
24754	0	a	Yeah that is true .
24755	0	a	Yeah .
24756	0	a	I mean , we have to remember our budget is twelve point twelve fifty for to actually make the device .
24757	0	a	Yeah .
24758	0	a	but it is something to think about , yeah .
24759	1	a	Well , I guess we have to get to that later ,
24760	1	a	yeah .
24761	1	a	I mean we will have to see how much that would be .
24762	0	a	Or some it i
24763	0	a	we can find out probably on the internet how much it is
24764	0	a	Yeah .
24765	0	a	Yeah ,
24766	0	a	and the other thing you said that thing about robust and water
24767	0	a	What was the word ?
24768	0	a	Water resistant .
24769	0	a	Furry .
24770	0	a	Oh I was just
24771	0	a	Yeah .
24772	0	a	No
24773	0	a	but it is
24774	0	a	I thought , , spot on .
24775	1	a	Good feel , tact tactile , good tactile feel ,
24776	1	a	maybe something didn does not make your hands sweat lot .
24777	0	a	Yeah .
24778	0	a	That is quite annoying .
24779	1	a	Maybe just like a simple thing to have a clip on it , like so you can clip it to your
24780	0	a	like that is another
24781	0	a	Yeah .
24782	0	a	Yeah , clip .
24783	0	a	Ooh .
24784	1	a	We should probably start wrapping up ,
24785	0	a	we have got some initial ideas that we can all look into .
24786	1	a	, and come up with some new ones for the next meeting ,
24787	0	a	which will be in another thirty minutes .
24788	0	a	So .
24789	0	a	Yeah .
24790	0	a	The Industrial Designer ,
24791	0	a	what does that stand for , ID ,
24792	0	a	yeah
24793	0	a	is going to be looking more into the working design .
24794	0	a	Yeah I think so .
24795	0	a	So I guess you would be looking at lots of the things we discussed about screen and that sort of thing .
24796	0	a	The something ,
24797	0	a	what is the UI ?
24798	0	a	Yeah , what does it stand for again ?
24799	0	a	User Interface Designer .
24800	0	a	User .
24801	0	a	That is me .
24802	0	a	, User Interface design .
24803	0	a	So that is going to be more technical .
24804	0	a	I guess that maybe the working design has also to do with like the physical feat like just the way it looks and the way
24805	0	a	it w
24806	0	a	Yeah ,
24807	0	a	yeah .
24808	0	a	So technical function .
24809	0	a	The working design is the structure .
24810	0	a	What is technical functions exactl
24811	0	a	I I do not really know what
24812	0	a	It does but
24813	0	a	it I just do not really
24814	0	a	Yeah .
24815	1	a	, I guess you would have to find out .
24816	0	a	It says on that email but it
24817	0	a	It said It said
24818	0	a	Yeah
24819	0	a	like
24820	0	a	Be a medium between you and the telly I think ,
24821	0	a	that is
24822	0	a	Marketing .
24823	0	a	It was in the email .
24824	0	a	I wrote down what mine were .
24825	0	a	What effect should the thing ha should it have ,
24826	0	a	okay .
24827	0	a	Alright .
24828	0	a	And working design .
24829	0	a	Okay .
24830	0	a	Yeah ,
24831	0	a	yeah .
24832	0	a	Alright .
24833	0	a	And how it works ,
24834	0	a	okay .
24835	0	a	Right .
24836	0	a	And the ME , what does that stand for ?
24837	0	a	M
24838	0	a	Marketing , right .
24839	0	a	Oh it is written here , but .
24840	0	a	So we will be working on the user requirements ,
24841	0	a	Yeah .
24842	0	a	So I guess that wraps it up .
24843	0	a	I will see you all in thirty minutes .
24844	0	a	 
24845	0	a	Okay .
24846	1	a	Kay so we will try to zip through this , since we are short on time .
24847	0	a	Welcome everybody .
24848	0	a	hope your sessions went well .
24849	0	a	so this is our functional design meeting , we are going to consider user needs , technical effects , and the working design of our remote control .
24850	0	a	I have been taking meetings on the minute minutes on the meetings ,
24851	1	a	and I will be putting them in the shared documents folder
24852	0	a	so if there is anything you need to refer to you can find them in there .
24853	1	a	I I will get the ones up for next time ,
24854	0	a	they are not finished yet .
24855	0	a	Right .
24856	1	a	so can we have updates from everyone from what you have worked
24857	0	a	on just kind of a quick summary of anything interesting that you would like to share or discuss in this
24858	0	a	sure .
24859	1	a	And I can start if you want .
24860	0	a	Is there an order ?
24861	0	a	No .
24862	0	a	We have not decided on an order .
24863	0	a	Hm ?
24864	0	a	No , any any order is fine .
24865	0	a	First .
24866	0	a	Okay .
24867	0	a	Yeah .
24868	0	a	, how do I put this
24869	1	a	I will just put the cable in .
24870	0	a	Just You may need to
24871	0	a	But sometimes you have to do it
24872	0	a	it is like a three set setting cycle , so press it a couple times , hold down function and then press F eight .
24873	0	a	Oh yeah ,
24874	0	a	sorry .
24875	0	a	Is that it ?
24876	0	a	Can you see ?
24877	0	a	Oh , here .
24878	0	a	Okay .
24879	0	a	So what happens it does not work ?
24880	0	a	No .
24881	0	a	It sh it takes a few seconds I think .
24882	0	a	Who is that ?
24883	0	a	Is it in the right thing ?
24884	0	a	Oh wait , .
24885	1	a	You need to help me .
24886	0	a	Uh huh , and then press function .
24887	0	a	Yeah .
24888	0	a	and F eight .
24889	1	a	Could you just plug it back into hers
24890	0	a	because she had oh .
24891	0	a	Oh , wait .
24892	0	a	That is
24893	0	a	is that it ?
24894	0	a	Right here we are .
24895	0	a	Adjusting .
24896	0	a	Here we are .
24897	0	a	The cable might be a little loose or something .
24898	0	a	Oh , you got it .
24899	0	a	Oh .
24900	0	a	Is it on ?
24901	0	a	Okay .
24902	0	a	We are here .
24903	0	a	Okay , .
24904	0	a	In order to see what the functional requirements were to be found , a hundred people were tested in a usability laboratory
24905	0	a	through just their habits to n know
24906	0	a	their habits were observed and questionnaires were given out .
24907	0	a	, the findings in in some cases matched what we were talking about .
24908	0	a	Custome Customers and users do not like the way remote controls look , they do not like the way they feel
24909	0	a	, they do not think they match their operating behaviour , and an example is what we were talking about , the buttons , they only use ten per cent of the buttons , so later on there is a study of the buttons that they use most
24910	1	a	and I think we should design according to these buttons .
24911	0	a	Easy to lose , and RSI .
24912	0	a	I do not know what RSI means .
24913	0	a	the person that did the questionnaire obviously did , I do not have a clue .
24914	0	a	Hm .
24915	0	a	, according to the frequency of use and the relevance of each buttons , I have made a list of the buttons that we should focus on in order of importance .
24916	0	a	So the most important buttons are those to do with channel selection .
24917	0	a	They are used about a hundred and sixty times per hour .
24918	0	a	And
24919	0	a	yeah
24920	0	a	so
24921	0	a	and and people like to zap a lot apparently ,
24922	0	a	so this is the order .
24923	0	a	Channel selection , teletext , volume , and power .
24924	0	a	The other ones are the settings , and they are used less than you know zero point eight to zero point five times per hour , and this means that I think we can we could have like a a button for all the settings , and then , just one , and then from there go on to the audio on the screen , either on the remote or on the television .
24925	0	a	about the screen , and speech recognition , some people are more willing than others to actually pay for that .
24926	0	a	And if we look at the market , f people from well from fifteen to thirty five year old year olds , I do not really know how to describe this , ninety one to seventy six percent of people in that age range are willing to pay more for this sort of product , while people that are above thirty five years ol years old go from thirty five percent to eight percent , so people that are sixty five for example would not actually pay for this sort of thing .
24927	0	a	I do not I do not know what the decision to be made is ,
24928	0	a	but I think that the people that actually do buy remotes m more are those like teenagers and young professionals and , most likely ,
24929	1	a	but we should discuss this together .
24930	0	a	And that is all I have to say about the matter , .
24931	0	a	Kay .
24932	0	a	Shall I
24933	0	a	what do I do ?
24934	0	a	Do I give this to someone else ?
24935	0	a	Function F eight .
24936	0	a	Yeah .
24937	0	a	Just move right on .
24938	0	a	Right .
24939	0	a	So get this .
24940	0	a	Okay so now I need to press F eight , what is it ?
24941	0	a	Kay .
24942	0	a	function F eight .
24943	0	a	What is function ?
24944	0	a	Oh function , I see it .
24945	0	a	It is the little blue w it is the one th
24946	0	a	yeah .
24947	0	a	There we go .
24948	0	a	Yeah should be
24949	0	a	It should be yeah .
24950	0	a	Okay .
24951	0	a	This my presentation about the technical functions design and I basically just tried to focus on just what what functions we need and how to make that the best function for the user .
24952	0	a	So and I just sort of like thought about it myself and looked on the internet .
24953	0	a	And okay so basically I think i like it is really important that we sort of get this done in a user friendly and fashionable way .
24954	1	a	so I think things like you know keeping buttons together that like close together that are used in the same way , or maybe that making them the same colour , keeping the number of buttons the leas you know to a minimum ,
24955	0	a	and also things like is it is
24956	0	a	it is it
24957	0	a	can you c
24958	0	a	y small enough large enough
24959	0	a	I am not sure
24960	0	a	we c
24961	1	a	I guess we would need to do some research about , I would , about what size is appropriate and that sort of thing ,
24962	0	a	but basically we need to make sure that it turns on and off the TV .
24963	0	a	Does it have like capacity to change the channels ?
24964	0	a	does it do
24965	0	a	or do we need to have like functions for cable or VCR ?
24966	0	a	And then , is it findable , and how do we want to do that ?
24967	0	a	And
24968	0	a	I just thought that these two remotes were pretty boring ,
24969	0	a	I dunno if this will work but
24970	0	a	And I think we can find something that is more fun to look at and use than either of those .
24971	0	a	Just I mean I like the one on the right better , just because it does have fewer buttons ,
24972	1	a	but I mean I think we sh can sort of think about things like like colour
24973	1	a	and you know size , shapes , that sort of thing , to best fit the user .
24974	0	a	That concludes my presentation .
24975	0	a	Okay .
24976	0	a	You need the little thingy .
24977	0	a	Ooh .
24978	0	a	How do I
24979	0	a	Right .
24980	0	a	S
24981	0	a	That is on view .
24982	0	a	Oh .
24983	0	a	Okay so this is on the working design , which is sort of the mechanical functions of the remote , and the method I used was to basically look at existing designs and incorporate ideas from our last meeting .
24984	0	a	so I think we need two basic functions which is just the basic remote functions , the user can input a channel or volume setting and it will be output to the TV .
24985	0	a	And also we talked about a location function where maybe you could press a button on the TV and it would send sort of signal to the remote where it would beep or flash or vibrate or whatever to tell you where the remote is .
24986	0	a	So the components we need are an energy source to power the remote , input which would probably be buttons , although we just talked about voice recognition , processor to take the information , something to transmit it to the TV , and we also need something on the remote that would receive the location signal and have an output , like possibly a beep or a vibration .
24987	0	a	And also you need a sender for location signal , which would probably be a separate thing that we would have to sell with the remote and people could stick it on their TV or stick it on their wall .
24988	0	a	And this is just sort of an overview of how the remote works .
24989	0	a	Power comes from the battery , goes to the chip , and then it is sent from there to an infrared bulb which is probably the easiest way to send to the TV .
24990	0	a	And then for the location function , you would have a sender on the TV which would output some sort of signal , we could use IR but we would probably want to use radio instead .
24991	0	a	That signal would go to a receiver which it would process it , and it would be output in the form of a buzzer or a light lighting up .
24992	1	a	so my personal preferences for how to build the remote would probably be , battery for the energy source ,
24993	0	a	that way you would not have to plug it in ,
24994	1	a	a button pad for input ,
24995	0	a	we can purchase a pre made chip which will handle all the processing stuff ,
24996	1	a	IR transmitter to communicate to the TV ,
24997	0	a	that is just sort of standard , so most TVs have an IR receiver .
24998	1	a	Probably a radio receiver to send out location function and to receive it and I would probably say a buzzer for the location function on the remote itself .
24999	0	a	So that concludes my presentation .
25000	0	a	Kay .
25001	0	a	Do you know about like
25002	0	a	I dunno , you seem like you know about
25003	0	a	Okay .
25004	0	a	Yeah , I d I was an engineer before I came here .
25005	0	a	Cool .
25006	0	a	Okay .
25007	0	a	Well thank you everybody .
25008	0	a	we have
25009	1	a	we will discuss that
25010	1	a	and then I just want to mention some new project requirements that came in .
25011	0	a	, teletext is apparently outdated , so due to internet popularity , so that is off the list .
25012	0	a	, also our remote should be used only for television , , no extra internet kind of fancy things , just the remote and the television .
25013	0	a	and also we need to incorporate our corporate image onto this ,
25014	0	a	so the phrase is , we put fashion in electronics ,
25015	1	a	so let is be fashionable I guess .
25016	0	a	if we have something
25017	0	a	I mean silver and and gold or yellow are our colours ,
25018	1	a	so if we had a like a kind of silver one like you saw , and yellow writing , something like that .
25019	0	a	Okay .
25020	1	a	So we need to make some decisions on the remote control functions .
25021	0	a	, yeah .
25022	0	a	Do Let is
25023	1	a	I guess we should yeah make some kind of brainstorming ,
25024	0	a	see what we can
25025	0	a	wha what
25026	0	a	well probably our target group and how it is going to going to appeal to our target group
25027	0	a	and I dunno the the s
25028	0	a	the buttons and what it does and that sort of thing .
25029	0	a	Like in terms of how it looks , or like what it does ?
25030	0	a	Okay .
25031	0	a	How it looks or the the buzzer you mean ,
25032	0	a	yeah , for sure , yeah .
25033	0	a	Yeah .
25034	0	a	Okay .
25035	0	a	So .
25036	0	a	So
25037	0	a	Is our target group then people
25038	0	a	so do we want to go ahead and design this thing with the finder button ?
25039	0	a	So
25040	0	a	Okay .
25041	0	a	I think that seems to
25042	0	a	yeah .
25043	0	a	It is easy to implement .
25044	0	a	So the
25045	0	a	yeah ,
25046	0	a	yeah ,
25047	0	a	yeah .
25048	0	a	Locator .
25049	0	a	So then our target age group would be the nineteen to thirty five range ,
25050	0	a	what was it ?
25051	0	a	Oh .
25052	0	a	Yeah , teenagers and young professionals .
25053	0	a	Well that is for speech recognition .
25054	0	a	Well
25055	0	a	I was thinking about that
25056	0	a	but I mean speech recognition is really hard to programme , and also , if the TV is on it is making sound and the people on the TV are talking , and if somebody says like one , then the TV is going to switch itself to channel one ,
25057	0	a	or it seems like a silly ,
25058	0	a	I am not sure how you would implement it .
25059	0	a	Oh , .
25060	0	a	And screen .
25061	0	a	That is only for speech recognition and screen .
25062	0	a	Yeah .
25063	0	a	Yeah
25064	0	a	yeah
25065	0	a	yeah .
25066	0	a	Yeah .
25067	0	a	I mean
25068	0	a	I just put the values in .
25069	0	a	Yeah .
25070	0	a	And if if you consider our budget , it probably
25071	0	a	if you consider our budget , to h have speech recognition programmed in every single remote might be a little pricey .
25072	0	a	But the screen is the same as what ,
25073	0	a	Yeah , I am happy with that .
25074	0	a	It is a cool idea but
25075	0	a	Well you would have to have a button on a TV or on your wall or some place since the TV already has power .
25076	0	a	Yeah .
25077	0	a	Yeah .
25078	0	a	Completely .
25079	0	a	Hu
25080	0	a	yeah .
25081	0	a	Right
25082	0	a	so
25083	0	a	yeah .
25084	0	a	Okay so are we going to have just some kind of a like we will have the buzzer on the som like on the TV itself .
25085	0	a	Yeah .
25086	0	a	Yeah .
25087	0	a	Yeah .
25088	0	a	Yeah you click the button , it is going to send out a signal , and I was thinking , IR is line of sight , so unless the remote is like actually in front of the TV it is not going to work , so probably like a radio signal like on a on a cell phone .
25089	0	a	Okay .
25090	0	a	Okay .
25091	0	a	Yeah .
25092	0	a	Okay .
25093	0	a	Alright .
25094	0	a	Okay .
25095	0	a	Sends out a signal and then the the remote hears the signal and so it beeps probably .
25096	0	a	Okay .
25097	0	a	So you you would need like a separate base for that or like something
25098	0	a	you can
25099	0	a	right .
25100	0	a	It would have to be sold separately because if the sender is on the remote then you would have to find the remote first to click the button to find the remote .
25101	0	a	Yeah ,
25102	0	a	yeah .
25103	0	a	So do you plug it in the T
25104	0	a	you plug it in TV , this thing ?
25105	0	a	Okay .
25106	0	a	Yeah , it would probably just stick it on your TV so if you need to find the remote , click the button .
25107	0	a	Okay .
25108	0	a	So it is now like a two part thing .
25109	0	a	Yeah , so it would be a two part package .
25110	0	a	Okay .
25111	0	a	Alright .
25112	0	a	Okay .
25113	0	a	So we get to design that too .
25114	0	a	Make it fashionable .
25115	0	a	, okay .
25116	0	a	So do you think even though we are not talking about speek speech recognition our target group should still be teenagers and young professionals .
25117	0	a	Yeah I think so .
25118	0	a	Yeah .
25119	0	a	Huh .
25120	0	a	Just there .
25121	0	a	Okay .
25122	0	a	Are we should that thing be on the thing to put the you s
25123	0	a	you talking about a home for it .
25124	0	a	Do you still want to build a little thing next to the telly or to p hang on the wall or shall we leave that for now ?
25125	0	a	Okay .
25126	0	a	Yeah .
25127	0	a	We probably leave that .
25128	0	a	I mean I guess one takes care of the other ,
25129	0	a	like if you can
25130	0	a	yeah
25131	0	a	if you can call it then it is
25132	0	a	Yeah .
25133	0	a	Yeah .
25134	0	a	Then it can live anywhere .
25135	0	a	Okay .
25136	0	a	Yeah .
25137	0	a	For the
25138	0	a	so you have that button ,
25139	0	a	that so there is
25140	0	a	is there a light or shall we leave just have a radio ?
25141	0	a	Are we just having a radio ?
25142	0	a	On the phone .
25143	0	a	on the TV or on the phone ?
25144	0	a	it seemed like a a beep seemed the most reasonable to me ,
25145	0	a	I think that is what the phone has , I mean when you need to find your phone , you just have someone call it
25146	0	a	and it starts ringing somewhere
25147	0	a	and then you can figure out that it is in the couch or wherever .
25148	0	a	T
25149	0	a	So i
25150	0	a	Yeah .
25151	0	a	You do not need a light .
25152	0	a	Yeah
25153	0	a	yeah
25154	0	a	yeah .
25155	0	a	Yeah .
25156	0	a	Yeah yeah .
25157	0	a	Yeah .
25158	0	a	And like if the if the phone is under the couch , you might not see the light , so
25159	0	a	yeah .
25160	0	a	You can hear it is under the couch
25161	0	a	yeah .
25162	0	a	So need the other buttons .
25163	0	a	So we have this .
25164	0	a	So I mean the two remotes that you had shown r
25165	0	a	I do not remember who showed them ,
25166	0	a	yeah
25167	0	a	you you did ,
25168	0	a	they are
25169	0	a	I mean one looked like it was for VCR type thing , and the other looked like just television .
25170	0	a	That was that was me .
25171	0	a	I think w I think they are both sort of just like general remo they are both general remotes .
25172	0	a	Oh really .
25173	0	a	And
25174	0	a	Yeah .
25175	1	a	Cause that that is something we have to decide , is whether we want to have VCR capabilities .
25176	0	a	Does anyone know if VCRs are the same across international ?
25177	0	a	Okay , so you would need like a whole different set of buttons for everybody is VCRs .
25178	0	a	They are not no .
25179	0	a	They are not , no .
25180	0	a	S
25181	0	a	Yeah .
25182	0	a	Yeah , that is right , yeah .
25183	0	a	It not VHS here ?
25184	0	a	But VCRs
25185	0	a	Yeah .
25186	0	a	But DVD probably is .
25187	0	a	Yeah , other than that region and coding thing .
25188	0	a	And and if we are if we are targeting young professionals and teenagers , I mean it is going to be DVD type , that is the the technology these days .
25189	0	a	Yeah , for sure .
25190	0	a	So .
25191	0	a	Okay ,
25192	0	a	let is see if I can
25193	0	a	I think still though , it should not be that hard to take like just reduce the number of buttons you know ,
25194	0	a	like cause if you just have like one menu button , that works like with a you know , or you can just kind of scroll through the options u that come up on the TV .
25195	0	a	Yeah .
25196	0	a	Yeah .
25197	0	a	Well for sure we need the
25198	1	a	I think we can just design the channels ?
25199	0	a	I mean power is just a button , and it is not used that much , s
25200	0	a	and it is usually that red
25201	0	a	and I think it is quite nice to keep it like red .
25202	0	a	S
25203	0	a	Huh .
25204	0	a	Yeah .
25205	0	a	Yeah .
25206	0	a	Yeah .
25207	0	a	Yeah .
25208	0	a	You know , I have seen some remotes that where you just hold one , like if you hold one down
25209	0	a	it is it is a different colour than the other buttons
25210	0	a	but that turns it on .
25211	0	a	So you do not actually have a separate power button , it is just
25212	0	a	But
25213	0	a	It might be confusing .
25214	0	a	Oh okay , yeah .
25215	0	a	It seems like that would be hard though .
25216	0	a	I mean , like because unless you know
25217	0	a	yeah .
25218	0	a	Yeah .
25219	0	a	Just cause I would not
25220	0	a	I would probably pick it up and just be like why is there no on button .
25221	0	a	Yeah .
25222	0	a	Besides you like to be able to go power .
25223	0	a	Yeah , I never think to hold something down .
25224	0	a	Yeah .
25225	0	a	I have the power
25226	0	a	I guess .
25227	0	a	Yeah .
25228	0	a	B
25229	0	a	Yeah .
25230	0	a	So we definitely want a power button and numbers .
25231	0	a	Yeah .
25232	0	a	Right .
25233	1	a	Well even iPod thing ,
25234	0	a	like ,
25235	0	a	I do not know
25236	0	a	if people like this
25237	1	a	but if you want to reduce the number , of buttons , instead of having like one to nine , have a sort of scrolling
25238	0	a	I do not know .
25239	1	a	That sort of like joystick flat touch thing , yeah .
25240	0	a	Yeah .
25241	0	a	Because people li seem
25242	0	a	now the iPod is out people seem to like this thing that there is no Know
25243	0	a	you do not have one two three four five
25244	0	a	Yeah
25245	0	a	yeah , it is just and it is one thing which has everything .
25246	0	a	Yeah ,
25247	0	a	yeah .
25248	0	a	I think that is an interesting idea , cause it is cool ,
25249	0	a	it is it is funny like you
25250	0	a	f like I just
25251	0	a	I do not have an iPod
25252	0	a	but like I , you know , I just like started messing around with one of my friend is the other day ,
25253	0	a	and you just sort of
25254	0	a	and
25255	0	a	it is funny how you pick it up
25256	0	a	and you just figure out how to use it quite easily ,
25257	0	a	like it is not that hard , you know .
25258	0	a	Yeah .
25259	0	a	Yeah , and it is
25260	0	a	yeah .
25261	0	a	It is really
25262	0	a	but do you need a screen then , do you have to have a screen then ?
25263	0	a	Yeah .
25264	0	a	Well ca not it tell the like ca not you if you
25265	1	a	you can have the number on the telly going like one two three four five once you scroll and then
25266	0	a	It is like l this like that , and then you do that .
25267	1	a	Yeah , you can have the number going around in the corner .
25268	0	a	Okay .
25269	0	a	Yeah .
25270	0	a	Yeah .
25271	0	a	Okay so we have this like scrolling sort of button .
25272	0	a	Oh that is going to
25273	0	a	Is that like on on a mouse pad where like kind of
25274	0	a	okay .
25275	0	a	Like a disc .
25276	0	a	Yeah .
25277	0	a	Yeah .
25278	0	a	It is like it is just like the same technology as a mouse pad .
25279	0	a	I have never used one .
25280	0	a	No .
25281	0	a	Okay .
25282	0	a	Okay .
25283	0	a	Yeah .
25284	0	a	Yeah and then .
25285	0	a	And then you can have
25286	1	a	if you actually just want to zap , you can have like a thing like that , and that , and then it can just be plus and minus .
25287	0	a	Okay .
25288	0	a	So like it is like a little part of the circle that
25289	0	a	Or it
25290	0	a	oh so it is just a region of the circle that you can zap .
25291	0	a	Yeah ,
25292	0	a	you can
25293	0	a	Yeah , click o actually click on to have
25294	0	a	Yeah .
25295	0	a	Well i
25296	1	a	We could we could even have four buttons , like , if that is the if that is the mouse , you could have the volume and the channel changers just like on that as well .
25297	0	a	Okay .
25298	0	a	Yeah .
25299	1	a	So volume could be like the top it and the bottom
25300	0	a	So do you need to
25301	0	a	okay .
25302	0	a	Does not it rotate though ,
25303	0	a	so it will be moving around .
25304	0	a	Well y you have to you have to like be able to change the function of it to like
25305	0	a	I mean like okay , cause so I dunno , I guess
25306	0	a	Okay
25307	0	a	so when you g scroll your thumb like around it , it will s like say you are go
25308	0	a	you are going clockwise .
25309	0	a	What do you mean the function ?
25310	0	a	Yeah .
25311	0	a	That that means you are going to go up the channels , and then you scroll the other way and it will go down .
25312	0	a	Yeah .
25313	0	a	But then
25314	0	a	so if you want to switch to the to u do you have to switch to a function where like y
25315	0	a	so you are either in that mode
25316	0	a	or you are in the mode
25317	0	a	where like it just has like the four like you know
25318	0	a	this is channel that way
25319	0	a	, that is that way and volume is up and down .
25320	0	a	Yeah but it knows for some reason .
25321	0	a	It just
25322	0	a	It just kno the iPod knows .
25323	0	a	The iPod knows .
25324	0	a	S
25325	0	a	Yeah .
25326	0	a	If it works on an iPod then it works .
25327	0	a	Huh .
25328	0	a	So you just you just can either do this or like you can just touch it if you want .
25329	0	a	I do not have one .
25330	0	a	Well for the volume you have to press the middle , and then go up .
25331	0	a	Okay .
25332	0	a	That is what I mean .
25333	0	a	Okay .
25334	0	a	Okay so you have to like press this middle region
25335	0	a	and then you can scroll up , go up and down .
25336	0	a	Oh .
25337	0	a	And then well if you do that it goes ,
25338	0	a	but if you like that makes more sense
25339	0	a	cause there is already ones with up and down here , that I have seen .
25340	0	a	So it is like holding
25341	0	a	You can o
25342	0	a	And you you
25343	0	a	is there an extra actual button ?
25344	0	a	Or are you actually you are just using the mouse to go up and down .
25345	0	a	Well what you for the iPod you press an
25346	0	a	w right
25347	0	a	if you are on the channel let is say , then you press on the middle and then if you do that again the volume goes up , and if you do that it goes down .
25348	0	a	Like
25349	0	a	It is like a b Like
25350	0	a	I think we can go on the fact that it does just work with the iPod .
25351	0	a	Right .
25352	0	a	But if you want to keep it with volume here and here , I am pretty sure
25353	0	a	Yeah .
25354	0	a	Well I mean if if you are going to this for channels , right , then y would not the volume need to be separate somehow ?
25355	0	a	Like you could just have Oh , like Oh
25356	0	a	you could actually
25357	0	a	Yeah .
25358	0	a	I do not know , you could click and then have it up and down ,
25359	0	a	but I think
25360	0	a	Yeah
25361	0	a	yeah
25362	0	a	yeah .
25363	0	a	Yeah .
25364	0	a	But the only thing is like , iPods are so expensive ,
25365	0	a	like , it has to be
25366	0	a	is that part of
25367	0	a	yeah ,
25368	0	a	I dunno , I dunno .
25369	0	a	Is that what makes them expensi
25370	0	a	I think it is all of
25371	0	a	they have so much memory though ,
25372	0	a	that is it is
25373	0	a	Yeah .
25374	0	a	I do not think so .
25375	0	a	You do not think so ?
25376	0	a	Okay .
25377	0	a	I do not think it is the wheel dealy .
25378	0	a	I think it
25379	0	a	Yeah .
25380	0	a	I think it is the h it is their capabili
25381	0	a	I mean they it can hold what like five thousand songs or something .
25382	0	a	Okay .
25383	0	a	Yeah .
25384	0	a	Yeah .
25385	0	a	I am thinking
25386	0	a	we could
25387	0	a	if if we are hav So ba
25388	0	a	I mean but an iPod just has that circle thing you know .
25389	0	a	And they are re programmable are not they ?
25390	0	a	You can put on your songs and then put on a different set , that is probably why they are expensive , they are like little computers .
25391	0	a	Yeah .
25392	0	a	Yeah .
25393	0	a	Yeah .
25394	0	a	Yeah .
25395	0	a	S
25396	0	a	Yeah .
25397	1	a	Well like since it just has the circle thing , you could make it a qui a kind of cool shape , like it could be a cool sort of you know , because it could be circular , you know , or something weird like that , just
25398	0	a	Yeah .
25399	0	a	Yeah .
25400	0	a	Yeah
25401	0	a	yeah
25402	0	a	yeah .
25403	1	a	Well it could just be simple instead of being a l mass .
25404	0	a	Because , the other thing , I did not tell you all my presentation , is that people find it find that it is a big waste of time to have to learn how to use your remote and that is another thing they complained about .
25405	0	a	Yeah .
25406	0	a	, what other buttons were there ?
25407	0	a	Volume
25408	0	a	oh we have
25409	0	a	ts just said that .
25410	0	a	So okay .
25411	0	a	Channel selection .
25412	0	a	This is just for TV , it is not for or it is does need to be compatible with
25413	0	a	Yeah .
25414	0	a	I
25415	0	a	A DVD is simple , you just have play , pause , eject , and menu maybe .
25416	0	a	You know actually our our new project requirements , I am not sure if they meant o onl use only for television as in not for DVD or just not internet type things .
25417	0	a	So how do you switch
25418	0	a	Okay .
25419	0	a	Menu .
25420	0	a	Oh yeah .
25421	1	a	So I will I will check that and update you on the next
25422	1	a	But we will hold off on that cause
25423	0	a	But s yeah .
25424	0	a	So like if we had that
25425	0	a	Yeah .
25426	0	a	But DVD players usually have their own remote .
25427	0	a	That is true , yeah .
25428	0	a	Yeah .
25429	0	a	So , I know I am not c really clear on what
25430	0	a	Yeah ,
25431	0	a	yeah .
25432	0	a	But it is cool to have it all on one , because you want to turn it on then you want to turn up the volume , and then you want to go to the menu , so you do not want to switch .
25433	0	a	Yeah ,
25434	0	a	yeah ,
25435	0	a	yeah .
25436	0	a	Yeah .
25437	0	a	So you would have to have like
25438	0	a	I think you would have to have like a function switch button , you know somewhere
25439	0	a	so like you
25440	0	a	can you are either on TV , you are on DVD or you are on VCR , or you are like .
25441	0	a	Yeah .
25442	0	a	Well but DVD is only like four buttons .
25443	0	a	So
25444	0	a	Yeah ,
25445	0	a	but I mean like to switch the fun so like to switch the function of the little circle disc , the touch pad .
25446	0	a	Yeah , it is only fun
25447	0	a	But i
25448	0	a	Yeah .
25449	0	a	Oh .
25450	0	a	But I think the circle only does
25451	0	a	channel is not applicable to DVD really cause you do not want to but volume is and volume is actually controlled on the TV
25452	0	a	so you do not have to switch .
25453	0	a	Yeah
25454	0	a	but it
25455	0	a	it would be
25456	0	a	So but I am saying like , does it make sense to have like some kind of a button ,
25457	0	a	so like you are if you are on TV , like you can switch channels ,
25458	0	a	but then if if you are on DVD then like the channel bu like the the region of the disc that was for channels is for like switching to different tracks
25459	0	a	or s you know , to different
25460	0	a	I mean do we need to think about that ,
25461	0	a	, yeah , let is think about it
25462	0	a	cause we need to wrap up .
25463	0	a	let is see .
25464	0	a	so everyone is going to go finish their questionnaire , then when we come back after lunch we will have thirty minutes of individual work ,
25465	1	a	yeah , so think about the things we have discussed and bring some new ideas to our next meeting .
25466	0	a	 
25467	0	a	Hi everyone , hope you had a nice lunch .
25468	0	a	Alright we are moving on to conceptual design .
25469	0	a	Iscuse me .
25470	0	a	Bless you .
25471	1	a	, I will just review what we did in our last meeting .
25472	0	a	, under marketing we targeted our audience ,
25473	0	a	and , yeah .
25474	0	a	That was generally how helpful that was .
25475	0	a	, then we considered some design options with how it should look , , we discussed an iPod like button system which , , we have not concluded
25476	0	a	but we are
25477	0	a	Right ,
25478	0	a	So , if you all have presentations to do , we can see what where you have come from our last time .
25479	0	a	Does everyone have presentations ?
25480	0	a	Okay .
25481	0	a	Yeah .
25482	0	a	Yes .
25483	0	a	Yes .
25484	1	a	Would anybody like to go first ?
25485	0	a	Okay .
25486	1	a	Sure .
25487	0	a	So I have been looking at the components design .
25488	0	a	Mostly by consulting remote control diagrams from the internet and also by incorporating design ideas from the last project meeting .
25489	0	a	, so we need some custom design parts , and other parts we will just use standard .
25490	0	a	, I assume we will be custom designing our case , probably a hard plastic or some other material case , to protect the remote and the locator .
25491	0	a	And we will need to custom desi design a circuit board , because the circuit board has to take the button input and send it to the output so you have to design that each time .
25492	0	a	But once we come up with a design we will send it to the circuit people and they will just print it out .
25493	0	a	, standard parts include the buttons and the wheels , the iPod style wheel .
25494	0	a	The infrared LED is actually going to be included in the circuit board that comes with it .
25495	0	a	, we need a radio sender and receiver , those are standard .
25496	0	a	And al we also need a beeper or buzzer or other sort of noise thing for locating the remote .
25497	0	a	So we have some material options .
25498	0	a	, we can use rubber , plastic , wood or titanium .
25499	1	a	, I would recommend against titanium
25500	0	a	because it can only be used in the flat cases and it is really heavy .
25501	0	a	, and the rubber case requires rubber buttons , so if we definitely want plastic buttons , we should not have a rubber case .
25502	0	a	And why not wood ?
25503	0	a	And why not wood ?
25504	0	a	Is good .
25505	0	a	And ,
25506	0	a	, well we can use wood .
25507	0	a	I do not know why we would want to .
25508	0	a	and also we should note that if we want an iPod style wheel button , it is going to require a m qu slightly more expensive chip .
25509	0	a	We ca not use the minimal chip , we need the next higher grade , which is called regular .
25510	0	a	I do not think it is much more expensive , but it is more expensive .
25511	0	a	So that is what I have got on design .
25512	1	a	, can I do next ?
25513	1	a	Cause
25514	1	a	I have to say something about the material
25515	0	a	which is quite shocking .
25516	0	a	Yeah .
25517	0	a	Ha .
25518	0	a	Right , , I have been searching the current trends , , both on the web and via fashion watchers , and the findings are that the first thing to aim for is a fashion , fancy look and feel .
25519	0	a	Next comes technologic technology and the innovations to do with that .
25520	0	a	And th last thing is the easy to use factor .
25521	0	a	, fancy look and feel goes far beyond the functionality of the thing , but I suppose that is included in in the ease of use .
25522	0	a	, our fashion watchers in Milan and Paris have decided , well noticed , that f the fruit and vegetable theme is the
25523	0	a	is the current trend and
25524	0	a	and therefore we need to go for that if we want , you know , wh whatever our motto is .
25525	0	a	For fashion , we go for fashion .
25526	0	a	The fashion in electronics .
25527	0	a	So we want to put the fashion electronics , we need to go fruit and vegetables .
25528	0	a	And also go for a spongy feel , so the the question of our technology whate is Industrial Designer .
25529	0	a	As to the material should be limited to I do not know how spongy it can be ,
25530	1	a	should discuss this together ,
25531	0	a	I do not know how spongy can be achieved but apparently that is the way to go .
25532	0	a	I I have been thinking about this fruit and vegetable thing and I prefer fruits to vegetables ,
25533	0	a	but that is just a personal opinion .
25534	0	a	I think
25535	0	a	I think people like to have a fruit instead of a vegetables in their sitting room .
25536	0	a	those are just suggestions
25537	1	a	and also we need to decide whether this should be printed ,
25538	0	a	so that still has to do with the material discuss
25539	0	a	should we print the fruit stuff , or should the actual remote look like a fruit ?
25540	0	a	, and finally again with the spongy .
25541	1	a	It has to be technologically innovative so maybe again our Industrial Designer should look into that or find come up with a solution that is better than mine .
25542	0	a	, yeah , to summarise these are the points that need to be , touched in order to get a good decision , and hopefully our User Interface has more to say about the matter .
25543	0	a	Thank you for your attention .
25544	0	a	So .
25545	0	a	I think it is the next it is the blue one , yeah .
25546	0	a	Oh , , there we go .
25547	0	a	Okay .
25548	0	a	Well so that fruit and vegetables thing huh .
25549	0	a	I actually was not aware of the new trends in electronics
25550	0	a	and and
25551	0	a	So so okay , let me get this right .
25552	0	a	Neither was I .
25553	0	a	Well it is a trend in fashion , in clothing and fabrics .
25554	0	a	Yeah but you are not going to wear your remote control .
25555	0	a	Okay ,
25556	0	a	Okay , alright anyway .
25557	0	a	here we go .
25558	0	a	Conceptual User Interface .
25559	0	a	Trying
25560	0	a	we are going to try to talk about , what kind of how people are actually going to be using this iPod ish remote control , based on fruit vegetable design .
25561	0	a	And , , basically , so , this is a touched ba a touch based graphical interface system .
25562	0	a	, so people are going to be looking at this little screen .
25563	0	a	, kind of
25564	0	a	I mean I assume , are we still on the screen idea ?
25565	0	a	Cause if we are going to have to ha if we have this
25566	0	a	it just seems like in order to have someone going around and using the the wheel
25567	0	a	you
25568	0	a	it seems like you would need a screen .
25569	0	a	Oh we s had not discussed it last time .
25570	0	a	You need a screen for it ?
25571	0	a	We are , , we are actually not having DVD ,
25572	0	a	that was one of th
25573	0	a	I
25574	0	a	I was
25575	0	a	sorry ,
25576	0	a	I I meant to update you on that .
25577	0	a	You need a screen with music because you are looking for a specific song , like you know that band or whatever .
25578	0	a	But like if you think about it
25579	0	a	yeah
25580	0	a	but if so is it just okay .
25581	0	a	With TV channels it is , you know , one two three .
25582	0	a	So
25583	0	a	Yeah .
25584	0	a	So , b you you are going to have to switch to like DVD and like other things like that , are not you ?
25585	0	a	Are we
25586	0	a	Okay .
25587	0	a	Alright .
25588	0	a	Okay .
25589	0	a	But the screen can come up on the telly , the she said .
25590	0	a	Okay .
25591	0	a	That correct ?
25592	1	a	Graphical interface ?
25593	0	a	on the
25594	1	a	you can have it on the telly though .
25595	0	a	Okay .
25596	0	a	Yeah .
25597	0	a	So anyway if well we just we need to
25598	0	a	Okay so if we are not going to have a screen I think
25599	0	a	I was thinking okay .
25600	0	a	So basically it is just going to be a wheel then ?
25601	0	a	And you are just going to
25602	1	a	I mean I think you are going to have to have some kind of a
25603	0	a	right .
25604	0	a	Yeah
25605	0	a	like you are g
25606	0	a	yeah
25607	0	a	like you are going to have to be able to switch to like a mode where you can
25608	0	a	okay we are not choosing that , I guess .
25609	0	a	Yeah .
25610	0	a	But like choose channel control ,
25611	0	a	like if you wa
25612	0	a	Because people are not going to be able to have like , , you know , channels one
25613	0	a	two three four five six seven eight nine .
25614	0	a	Yeah .
25615	0	a	So that
25616	0	a	people seems to be well
25617	0	a	You know .
25618	0	a	You have
25619	0	a	Yeah , I know what you are saying ,
25620	0	a	you have to
25621	0	a	But but imagine someone with s
25622	0	a	But i what if you have satellite and you have like two hundred channels .
25623	0	a	But you are going to have to scroll to get channels .
25624	0	a	So
25625	0	a	I guess that is wh why I was thinking you may need to have some kind of a screen
25626	0	a	because
25627	0	a	So that people can go arou go back and forth and choose if
25628	0	a	or or then again if you just I guess I c
25629	1	a	I can see like some kind of a thing where like you sort of have like the number come up on the TV like what channel you are on .
25630	0	a	Yeah ,
25631	0	a	yeah ,
25632	0	a	yeah .
25633	1	a	You can just scroll and you can just get to like five or like twelve or
25634	0	a	I
25635	0	a	oh yeah ?
25636	0	a	Cause you will have to like but you can quickly s you can
25637	0	a	Yeah .
25638	0	a	Yeah .
25639	0	a	Yeah ,
25640	0	a	yeah .
25641	0	a	My flatmates actually had one with a wheel , and it it did show up on the TV .
25642	0	a	Then to get to channel one eighty nine you have to
25643	0	a	Yeah .
25644	0	a	Yeah .
25645	0	a	They have to r wheel really fast .
25646	0	a	But I think the wheel goes through like a hundred channels , at least on theirs .
25647	0	a	Yeah ,
25648	0	a	yeah ,
25649	0	a	yeah .
25650	0	a	Yeah if you do , it w
25651	0	a	so it would have to be you
25652	1	a	I mean so you basically just kind of need to figure out like what kind of
25653	1	a	, you know , range we need to have on the wheel ,
25654	0	a	and
25655	0	a	So you are either you are you know , th you are either doing this motion to like control the channels or like once once you stop that , you know , you can like tap for , , different , whatchamacallits , different , you know , functions like volume or , like you can tap just to get to different channels .
25656	0	a	Yeah .
25657	0	a	Like if you just wanted to go to like from five to six you could tap or someth
25658	0	a	And then there is also the concern about you know how do you get to the menu if you want to change the brightness of your television , or if you want to you know switch around , I do not know , like , these different modes like turn on the timer or like something something like that ,
25659	0	a	like
25660	0	a	I would think so too , like
25661	0	a	So I mean and it seems it w
25662	0	a	it does seem a little silly to have this screen if you hardly are ever using it , you know ,
25663	0	a	because
25664	0	a	but then again it would
25665	0	a	it does make kind of if the screen is sort of just like an option that , like , is just there and you are not really using it , that is kind of
25666	0	a	m
25667	0	a	yeah .
25668	0	a	Right .
25669	0	a	Yeah
25670	0	a	I mean with that many options , you would I would think that the screen would be better ,
25671	0	a	because you could have that menu option , sort of
25672	0	a	Yeah .
25673	0	a	Yeah .
25674	0	a	It is more expensive according to the design people .
25675	0	a	Yeah , that is the only thing though .
25676	0	a	You have to get a an advanced chip if you want to have a screen in , which is more expensive than the regular chip , which is more expensive than the minimal .
25677	0	a	Yeah .
25678	0	a	So then basically it has to have some way to get to get to a mode on the television where you are doing ,
25679	0	a	You can get to you know ,
25680	0	a	you can
25681	1	a	Like maybe it will be that central button
25682	0	a	that , like , then you hit that
25683	0	a	and then you can it brings up like the menu on the TV and you can just scroll around , like , to do the timer , to do the yeah
25684	0	a	, yeah .
25685	0	a	Yeah ,
25686	0	a	yeah ,
25687	0	a	yeah .
25688	0	a	Yeah .
25689	0	a	Yeah .
25690	0	a	So the TV is the screen , that
25691	0	a	yeah
25692	0	a	So it would have all these different options of changing
25693	0	a	to
25694	0	a	Okay .
25695	0	a	Yeah .
25696	0	a	But the remote itself is not really cluttered up .
25697	0	a	Look it even has settings .
25698	0	a	Yeah , well we do not want the screen I guess ,
25699	0	a	but cause that just
25700	0	a	it does seem like , it that would be , like , incredibly expensive ,
25701	0	a	but I dunno , and then so ,
25702	0	a	it
25703	0	a	just im really all you need
25704	0	a	is , like , this little wheel then , and you can control everything .
25705	0	a	On the
25706	0	a	you can just take theirs and just
25707	0	a	Yeah but should be comfortable .
25708	0	a	Yeah .
25709	0	a	Yeah .
25710	0	a	So
25711	0	a	Yeah .
25712	0	a	, right .
25713	0	a	What if
25714	0	a	I mean , if you are thinking of the design of it now , like the a you know , physical attributes , , and you just have this , it is like just a long silver thing , or whatever we are thinking .
25715	1	a	I mean are you you going to have any buttons on that besides power and this thing ?
25716	0	a	Or
25717	0	a	Yeah .
25718	0	a	It does not seem that you would need anything besides pow
25719	1	a	I mean and the power button could even be like hold down the menu button for like longer than one second
25720	1	a	and it turns on the TV .
25721	0	a	So can we imagine that this would be smaller than the remote controls that you showed us before .
25722	0	a	I mean
25723	0	a	okay .
25724	0	a	Yeah .
25725	0	a	Yeah definitely .
25726	1	a	Like , I think we are looking at something that could be , like like even maybe like a cir I am f I am seeing almost like a circular sort of like handheld like thing .
25727	0	a	I mean it it needs to be easy to
25728	0	a	somehow it needs to be easy to like manipulate
25729	0	a	and use your
25730	0	a	I mean how do how do I am not really
25731	0	a	Like when I use an iPod , I end up just kind of using my index finger to like control it .
25732	0	a	Yeah .
25733	0	a	Yeah .
25734	0	a	Yeah .
25735	0	a	Yeah .
25736	0	a	Yeah ,
25737	0	a	I have seen some people just going like that with their thumb , yeah .
25738	0	a	So
25739	0	a	Yeah .
25740	0	a	Yeah
25741	0	a	I use it like that .
25742	0	a	Or your thumb or something .
25743	0	a	W when we had the wheely remote control , we it was on the top I think , if you held it like that .
25744	0	a	So
25745	0	a	Yeah .
25746	0	a	Yeah .
25747	0	a	Yeah .
25748	0	a	Yeah , so
25749	0	a	yeah .
25750	0	a	But , were there buttons on there as well ?
25751	0	a	Yeah well it had the wheely thing
25752	0	a	and then it had those eighteen different buttons that I do not know what they do .
25753	0	a	Yeah .
25754	0	a	So we just used the top part .
25755	0	a	Yeah .
25756	0	a	Yeah ,
25757	0	a	so
25758	1	a	but I mean I think it could be pretty small .
25759	0	a	Like , I d I mean , you you want it to be large enough that you can But ca not you just get K
25760	0	a	Yeah ,
25761	0	a	But , I mean , do you need that ?
25762	0	a	If if you can get to , you know if
25763	0	a	so long as you are able to bring up the menu on the TV screen .
25764	1	a	What if , , you had like a b a cover that went over buttons that you do not use very much ?
25765	0	a	Like you
25766	0	a	so you could slide it up if you needed to like change the contrast or something like that ?
25767	0	a	So the options are there but they are not in interfering with the design and the practicality of it .
25768	0	a	Do
25769	0	a	do you know what I am talking about though ?
25770	0	a	Like , , yeah just something
25771	0	a	Yeah , that you can flip over , yeah
25772	0	a	, yeah .
25773	0	a	Yeah .
25774	1	a	Yeah like maybe something on the side where you slip a panel down and it is got a whole bunch of
25775	0	a	Yeah .
25776	0	a	Well you can have it on the settings ,
25777	0	a	no ?
25778	0	a	They already do it .
25779	0	a	Yeah I mean I guess that is the thing
25780	0	a	is is if w I
25781	0	a	if we can do this , that would probably be
25782	0	a	Yeah ,
25783	0	a	yeah .
25784	0	a	That keeps it really
25785	0	a	Yeah .
25786	0	a	you would not I do not
25787	0	a	I just do not think you would even need it .
25788	0	a	So
25789	0	a	Mean
25790	0	a	I mean you can do it ,
25791	0	a	you it is
25792	0	a	it does not seem that hard .
25793	1	a	So I guess we have to look into the , , like , the programming , how this how they actually programme these things , and if that is
25794	0	a	yeah .
25795	0	a	Oh how they make the menu show up on the TV ?
25796	0	a	I do not know .
25797	0	a	I mean it would y would that would be
25798	0	a	Huh .
25799	0	a	I believe it is ins it is gotta be inside the TV , not inside the remote .
25800	0	a	I mean I have never bought a remote .
25801	0	a	I am not sure .
25802	0	a	It sounds like this remote is going to be purchased separately from the television ,
25803	0	a	which is a little
25804	0	a	My
25805	0	a	I have never bought just a remote , like , so I do not I do not really know .
25806	0	a	Well they usually are .
25807	0	a	Well
25808	0	a	I guess that is right .
25809	0	a	No .
25810	0	a	But So , but I mean it is
25811	0	a	I have never had a hard time with like my remotes , like bringing up the menu screen if you need to like change the date or whatever , you know .
25812	0	a	It always comes with the TV .
25813	0	a	And I do not think that should that should be too hard .
25814	0	a	Yeah ,
25815	0	a	it
25816	0	a	most of the ones we have had have had the menu button , cause it is not like you need to have a button access to like change the contrast or something .
25817	0	a	Yeah .
25818	0	a	Cause it just does not come up every day or something .
25819	0	a	Yeah .
25820	0	a	Well so
25821	0	a	So , do we need
25822	0	a	I dunno .
25823	0	a	Well I guess we have to you know think about
25824	0	a	But I mean you just basically need the output signal you know to be able to bring it up .
25825	0	a	Yeah .
25826	0	a	Okay .
25827	0	a	That is what it does anyway .
25828	0	a	But also if you have it on the screen you can actually write everything out , because the problem with buttons is you like , they have these sort of abbreviations and codes that you are supposed to understand , and I never get it .
25829	0	a	Yeah .
25830	0	a	Yeah .
25831	0	a	Yeah ,
25832	0	a	you do not know they mean , yeah ,
25833	0	a	it is like
25834	0	a	yeah .
25835	0	a	Yeah .
25836	0	a	Never ever .
25837	0	a	So
25838	0	a	Well on the telly .
25839	0	a	So , but
25840	0	a	oh , you mean if we have this screen like the iPod screen ?
25841	0	a	On the telly , okay
25842	0	a	, yeah .
25843	0	a	Or on the TV too .
25844	0	a	So yeah I think , I mean , I think I think the touch based graphical interface is a really cool idea because you know it is so obnoxious to like have to push those like
25845	0	a	okay
25846	0	a	now I hit this you know
25847	0	a	, you have your little guide out
25848	0	a	and you are like , hit this button twice , like to activate the date .
25849	0	a	And it is technologically innovative in a way ,
25850	0	a	so that fits with the B
25851	0	a	Yeah .
25852	0	a	Yeah .
25853	0	a	I guess .
25854	0	a	And it is trendy , the iPods are really hot right now , so
25855	0	a	, yeah , by web research , yeah ,
25856	0	a	so
25857	0	a	Oh .
25858	0	a	Did you did you get that pc picture on
25859	0	a	did they provide you with that picture on the web ?
25860	0	a	That is quite interesting .
25861	1	a	What are we going to do about this vegetable thing that I am dreading ?
25862	0	a	Yeah .
25863	0	a	Oh god .
25864	1	a	Oh , I was going to say .
25865	0	a	You said people want spongy .
25866	0	a	, one of your
25867	0	a	one of the material options is a sort of rubber that is in like those stress ball things .
25868	0	a	Yeah .
25869	0	a	So , that would be spongy .
25870	0	a	Oh , okay , that would be cool .
25871	0	a	Yeah .
25872	0	a	Yeah .
25873	0	a	Yeah .
25874	0	a	Just nice feel , but I hate spongy .
25875	0	a	Yeah ,
25876	0	a	c that is e that would be kind of
25877	0	a	oh ,
25878	0	a	you know , usually like the touch pad things are kind of a hard plastic typ mouse type , you know , thing .
25879	0	a	Yeah .
25880	0	a	Yeah .
25881	1	a	But what if we ha what if we had like a spongy sort of like stress balley kind of
25882	0	a	so you are like
25883	1	a	Or what if we integrated the the the f what if the whole thing about the fruit and vegetables we somehow made it tactilely fash you know , we c tapped into that , so like it feels like a vegetable .
25884	0	a	I mean definitely the area round it .
25885	0	a	Yeah I think it could work .
25886	0	a	Yeah .
25887	1	a	Well it could be like mobiles that just you just put a cover .
25888	1	a	An orange .
25889	0	a	Do not think I would want it to feel like a banana .
25890	0	a	Yeah .
25891	1	a	If it is a small thing , you c instead of creating an object for it that looks like a banana ,
25892	0	a	which frankly I am not particularly fond of ,
25893	1	a	you could just have covers and then your mobile f it is like a mobile phone thing .
25894	0	a	You know you had there was a time when they had all these different covers for mobiles .
25895	0	a	Yeah .
25896	0	a	Yeah .
25897	0	a	Yeah .
25898	1	a	You could do like the computers where they have like the grapefruit , apple machine and they have like the blueberry , like all the colours are named after fruits .
25899	0	a	Yeah ,
25900	0	a	yeah ,
25901	0	a	yeah .
25902	0	a	Yeah .
25903	0	a	Yeah .
25904	0	a	Yeah .
25905	0	a	Yeah .
25906	1	a	You could name it after fruits and vegetables , or
25907	0	a	Yeah .
25908	1	a	And it could the colour can fit your sitting room ,
25909	0	a	so if you have red sitting room you can have strawberry , and then if you have a green one you can have well I do not know .
25910	0	a	So what if what this is
25911	0	a	I am just forming this idea in my head of how this thing is looking .
25912	0	a	So I think
25913	0	a	yeah , colours .
25914	1	a	If you have like that stress ball material kind of as what you are actually holding in your hand ,
25915	0	a	so like what you are feeling is comfortable ,
25916	1	a	and then there is more of a hard plastic thing where that thing is .
25917	0	a	Yeah .
25918	0	a	Yeah .
25919	1	a	And on that hard plastic thing you can change either the colour or the fruit or vegetable that is on there .
25920	0	a	Yeah .
25921	0	a	Is that kind of
25922	0	a	I cause I I am thinking of silver because those are our company colours .
25923	0	a	Yeah .
25924	1	a	I mean how are you how are you all envisioning by what we have just the feedback we have just got about the
25925	0	a	A ball ?
25926	0	a	Yeah .
25927	0	a	Unfortunately they do not have silver fruits and vegetables .
25928	0	a	I do I dunno .
25929	1	a	That is in the shape of a fruit , like a
25930	0	a	Yeah .
25931	1	a	Maybe a ball .
25932	1	a	Know , a squashy ball .
25933	1	a	A relaxing squashy ball .
25934	0	a	That you can p
25935	0	a	well I
25936	0	a	see you are thinking , it is weird , you are thinking the opposite of me cause you are thinking you change the the hard bit
25937	1	a	and I am thinking how do you change the hard
25938	0	a	would you put a sticker sort of ?
25939	1	a	Because I was thinking if you have a cover for the squashy bit ,
25940	0	a	like a
25941	0	a	Oh , okay ,
25942	0	a	yeah .
25943	0	a	This is just
25944	0	a	Okay .
25945	0	a	Say that is the s say that is the squashy bit .
25946	0	a	Squashy .
25947	0	a	Yeah
25948	1	a	I was thinking of getting a cover for
25949	0	a	Which is cheaper .
25950	0	a	That
25951	0	a	see I was thinking this s
25952	0	a	sorry
25953	1	a	I was thinking this bit here would be the cover and like that is your actual thing .
25954	0	a	Well I do not know if it is cheaper actually .
25955	0	a	Oh .
25956	1	a	And like this you could have like you could have like cherries and things around there .
25957	0	a	Oh I like that shape .
25958	0	a	Yeah .
25959	0	a	but
25960	1	a	I was thinking if it was like this
25961	0	a	cause the way you were describing the the iPod and the thi the roll thingy
25962	0	a	It is almost like your thumb is farther up ,
25963	1	a	so if if you could squish it lower then
25964	0	a	Yeah , I know what you meant ,
25965	0	a	yeah .
25966	1	a	I was thinking sort of a single ball shape .
25967	0	a	Yeah .
25968	0	a	So you are holding a squishy ball
25969	0	a	and then it has a
25970	0	a	It is like it has to be s
25971	0	a	yeah .
25972	0	a	Yeah I guess so .
25973	0	a	Yeah .
25974	0	a	Yeah .
25975	0	a	So it would not be very big in either
25976	0	a	like how big ?
25977	1	a	This big , and then you just do that , I suppose .
25978	0	a	What if , yeah , what if the squishy ,
25979	0	a	oh so so you are saying the squishy part is like detachable ,
25980	0	a	and you can
25981	1	a	so so maybe one you know you can have like the broccoli squishy thing , and then you could have like the banana squishy thing and you could get you could have your choice , you know ?
25982	0	a	Yeah .
25983	0	a	Well just a li I ca not des like condom thingy , like a a cover .
25984	0	a	But well the question is , which one is easiest to change
25985	1	a	and we can just contact our relevant department for that , and just see what the cost is for covering that or covering that , and for now we can do two prototypes maybe and then hi try and ask users what the best is ,
25986	0	a	and No .
25987	0	a	Yeah .
25988	0	a	Yeah ,
25989	0	a	yeah .
25990	0	a	Yeah .
25991	0	a	Okay .
25992	0	a	Yeah .
25993	0	a	Yeah .
25994	0	a	Okay .
25995	0	a	Oh .
25996	0	a	That is nicer .
25997	0	a	I think it is nicer to have a drawing cause it is neater .
25998	0	a	Yeah .
25999	0	a	Well that is not very neat , but
26000	0	a	Yeah .
26001	0	a	I mean I think
26002	0	a	and I think the handhe I think the handheld part is definitely
26003	1	a	So you could make that into the fruit and vegetable part .
26004	1	a	If it is a bit like those juggling balls , you can change shape according to your to the way you hold it .
26005	0	a	Yeah you could squish it .
26006	1	a	If it is got sand in it maybe , or something , you it
26007	1	a	it just moulds to your hand .
26008	0	a	Yeah .
26009	0	a	Yeah .
26010	1	a	So where are the fruit and vegetables now ?
26011	0	a	Fruits and veg .
26012	0	a	We we do not know .
26013	1	a	I guess they would be either in the colour of that plastic face on the front , or in the colour of the squishy thing underneath .
26014	0	a	Yeah .
26015	0	a	Yeah .
26016	0	a	Yeah .
26017	0	a	Yeah .
26018	0	a	And the rest is the company
26019	0	a	the company colour is silver ?
26020	0	a	Okay .
26021	0	a	It was , yeah , silver and yellow .
26022	0	a	It
26023	0	a	l it looks like I do not
26024	0	a	Yeah .
26025	1	a	We could promote the banana one .
26026	0	a	Like .
26027	0	a	I mean that is another question ,
26028	0	a	where are we going to
26029	1	a	we we should have the logo somewhere on it .
26030	1	a	Should also fit the batteries ,
26031	0	a	which we have not
26032	0	a	Okay .
26033	0	a	Oh yeah .
26034	0	a	Yeah .
26035	0	a	I think the batteries would have to go right under the plastic case .
26036	0	a	Yeah ,
26037	0	a	th and that would that
26038	0	a	Yeah .
26039	0	a	Especially if you are switching out the squishy part .
26040	0	a	Then you need to have the other part just be sort of a single unit that you can snap off .
26041	0	a	Yeah , I think ,
26042	0	a	it would be interesting to have the b the squishy bit .
26043	0	a	The part that you , yeah , can change into the different , you know , trendy vegetables and fruits .
26044	0	a	But it
26045	0	a	Yeah .
26046	0	a	Well I dunno .
26047	0	a	You would spend so much time like squishing it to your own personal hand .
26048	0	a	Then you would get a new one and you would have to do it all over again .
26049	0	a	No
26050	0	a	but it does it automatically .
26051	0	a	Does it automatically ?
26052	0	a	I do not know .
26053	0	a	Yeah .
26054	0	a	I do not know what the rest of my notes mean because they were made for me .
26055	0	a	Okay .
26056	0	a	But if someone
26057	0	a	components concept .
26058	0	a	Question mark .
26059	0	a	Energy .
26060	0	a	Question mark .
26061	0	a	That was me .
26062	0	a	Was that you ?
26063	0	a	Okay .
26064	0	a	Yes .
26065	0	a	Oh right right .
26066	0	a	Yeah .
26067	0	a	, so what d but what do we know about energy ?
26068	0	a	I mean we are going to use batteries
26069	0	a	right ?
26070	0	a	And
26071	0	a	I think batteries sound good .
26072	0	a	we actually had an option of batteries , solar power , and a dynamo , which is something I do not know what it is .
26073	0	a	Something to do with torches .
26074	0	a	Oh , a dynamo is , it is a bicycle .
26075	0	a	It is a bicycle mechanism .
26076	0	a	It is the en it is like if if something moves , when it moves , it stores energy .
26077	0	a	Oh okay .
26078	0	a	Yeah , the other one was the other one was a kinetic thing where you would basically have to wind it yourself .
26079	0	a	So I sort of picked battery .
26080	0	a	It is quite sweet .
26081	0	a	We could have talked about doing a wind up or a dynamo or a solar power .
26082	0	a	but I think solar power is not available with the rubber case anyways .
26083	0	a	It it seems a little weird for a living room anyways .
26084	0	a	What does everyone else think ?
26085	0	a	What about Kryptonite ?
26086	0	a	Yeah .
26087	0	a	No .
26088	0	a	The dynamo would be interesting .
26089	0	a	But dynamo the the fact with dynamo is , the moment you move it , it c it creates energy on its own .
26090	0	a	Oh .
26091	0	a	Which is quite cool .
26092	0	a	So if you throw it , it is going to store loads of energy , and you do not need to buy a battery cause they are quite f
26093	0	a	I find them annoying .
26094	1	a	But we need to find cost .
26095	0	a	Do not know the cost .
26096	0	a	Did not have enough data to actually
26097	0	a	All it said was it gave sort of relative , some chips are more expensive than others , sort of things .
26098	0	a	Does anyone have costs on the on the web ?
26099	0	a	Okay .
26100	0	a	It did not give me any actual cost .
26101	0	a	Right .
26102	0	a	Most of the stuff is pretty cheap though bought in bulk .
26103	0	a	So I do not think it is that much of a problem .
26104	0	a	Like the chip is probably the most expensive part .
26105	0	a	What does chip on print mean ?
26106	0	a	Uh huh .
26107	0	a	, for things like remote controls , , they stamp out a chip , calculators too I think .
26108	0	a	, so you can mass produce them pretty cheap .
26109	0	a	Okay .
26110	0	a	But it is not like a computer , you ca not like reprogramme your remo remote controls , it is like stamped onto the chip .
26111	0	a	Right .
26112	0	a	So , chip on print is just means like that they are mass produced .
26113	0	a	Yeah .
26114	0	a	Okay .
26115	0	a	And case ?
26116	0	a	I guess that is what we have been talking about ,
26117	0	a	yeah .
26118	0	a	Casing .
26119	0	a	Yeah .
26120	0	a	thinking of like syntactic case and thi
26121	0	a	let is see .
26122	0	a	Is there anything else we need to talk about ?
26123	0	a	Oh when we move on , you two are going to be playing with play dough .
26124	0	a	, and working on the look and feel of the design and user interface design .
26125	0	a	And you are going to be doing protu product evaluation .
26126	0	a	So you will get m more instructions from your personal coach .
26127	0	a	Oh , thank you .
26128	0	a	See you soon .
26129	0	a	Does it matter that I end early ?
26130	0	a	How how early is it ?
26131	0	a	 
26132	0	a	Kay .
26133	0	a	Okay everybody .
26134	0	a	Welcome to the detailed design meeting .
26135	0	a	Let is see .
26136	0	a	Our agenda .
26137	0	a	Last time we discussed the squishy fruitiness of our remote controls and how we might pursue that .
26138	0	a	and I think looks like we have come up with some ideas .
26139	0	a	and we also talked about materials we would use and what kind of chip would be necessary .
26140	0	a	so for later in the meeting I have done a a spreadsheet of production costs
26141	1	a	so we will take a look at that .
26142	0	a	and see if it is changed at all from when we last discussed it .
26143	0	a	so actually I think
26144	0	a	Yeah
26145	0	a	f
26146	1	a	you guys want to give a prototype presentation of
26147	0	a	Oh is that broccoli ?
26148	0	a	Is a very bright strawberry .
26149	1	a	Okay
26150	0	a	well .
26151	0	a	So our design looks something like this .
26152	0	a	This being the wheel that you use to change channels or volume or whatever .
26153	0	a	This is a button , serves as the power button if you hold it down , and if you just tap on it
26154	0	a	I think it brings up the menu .
26155	0	a	And the base of the remote control , which has a squishy spongy rubbery feel , is interchangeable .
26156	0	a	So you can change the colour , according to your to suit your living room or whatever .
26157	0	a	And it comes
26158	0	a	yeah , I can change the vegetable .
26159	0	a	You could change the vegetable , or fruit .
26160	0	a	This one is broccoli .
26161	0	a	Yeah .
26162	0	a	So this snaps off and you can put on whichever one you want .
26163	0	a	This is not to scale cause it would have the battery inside it .
26164	0	a	This is a mango .
26165	0	a	The
26166	0	a	it is trendy fruit , it is not just ordinary fruits .
26167	0	a	You do not have orange , you have mango .
26168	0	a	I guess strawberry is not as trendy , but
26169	1	a	So we will come up with a variety of trendy and exciting fruit designs for the remote control .
26170	0	a	It is been a l
26171	0	a	It is been a little bit difficult to make sure that it is hand holdable , and that the user can use it , you know , it is not too big .
26172	0	a	And then people will be encouraged to buy three or five of them , because they will need to switch them out .
26173	0	a	but we think that this you know , this size will be okay
26174	0	a	and we will have to fit the battery case in there somehow .
26175	0	a	Oh yeah .
26176	0	a	And I guess the only other thing that we really did not talk about was or design yet actually , would be the thing the locator .
26177	0	a	How how so
26178	0	a	Okay
26179	0	a	so that is just
26180	0	a	So you have to have a button on your on your
26181	0	a	you have to attach the button to the
26182	0	a	Yeah we have that that has yes yet to be designed .
26183	0	a	Well the locator is just chip that is inside there .
26184	0	a	And the beeper is also inside there too somewhere
26185	0	a	Yeah
26186	0	a	we did not design that .
26187	0	a	But it would be coordinating with that of course .
26188	0	a	Yeah that c
26189	0	a	hey that that could you know match the handset .
26190	0	a	Yeah .
26191	0	a	You could have a broccoli , or you could have a mango .
26192	0	a	So .
26193	0	a	Tada .
26194	0	a	Oh .
26195	1	a	if you want to look in your project documents folder , there is an Excel spreadsheet .
26196	0	a	the only one that is in there , production costs .
26197	1	a	And if you open it up .
26198	0	a	I have just stuck the numbers in ,
26199	0	a	it was a real challenge there .
26200	1	a	But if I missed anything that we have gone over , or if you see something that has changed
26201	0	a	I mean , we decided on batteries , and the regular chip would be necessary for the more advanced iPod like button .
26202	0	a	I said uncurved or flat .
26203	0	a	I think that is what you have there ,
26204	0	a	is that right ?
26205	0	a	For the for the plastic part would be
26206	0	a	Oh .
26207	0	a	My impression was that flat meant like like one of those square remotes .
26208	0	a	But it is really not very clear ,
26209	0	a	because you got single curve and double curve and d I dunno what that means .
26210	0	a	Okay .
26211	0	a	Right .
26212	0	a	One side is curved and then the other side is curved .
26213	0	a	Well yeah .
26214	0	a	If we are talking about the area just
26215	0	a	oh I d
26216	0	a	I dunno .
26217	1	a	I guess we would have to contact the company that makes them and see .
26218	0	a	so what else ?
26219	0	a	There is plastic for that area around the button .
26220	0	a	and then rubber would be the squishy like thing right ?
26221	0	a	and lots of special colours actually .
26222	0	a	scroll wheel .
26223	0	a	Do you see anything that I have missed ?
26224	0	a	Okay so that would make our total of eleven point nine , which is even less than twelve point five , which means we would be making even more of a profit .
26225	0	a	No
26226	0	a	I think that is alright .
26227	0	a	And if we sold a lot of squishy things .
26228	0	a	Boo
26229	0	a	yeah .
26230	0	a	Okay .
26231	0	a	S
26232	0	a	So .
26233	0	a	Did y what did you work on ?
26234	0	a	The
26235	0	a	Okay .
26236	0	a	evaluation criteria .
26237	1	a	Do you want to
26238	0	a	Okay .
26239	1	a	I have got a presentation .
26240	0	a	I think that is
26241	0	a	Huh , the PowerPoint one ?
26242	0	a	Yeah .
26243	0	a	So I need where is the cable ?
26244	0	a	Right what happens is we have to decide whether this this whole this whole project we have been working on actually meets the standards we were set at the start .
26245	0	a	Right .
26246	0	a	This does not
26247	0	a	okay .
26248	0	a	the method is we well I have analysed the user requirements and integrated them to the trends found in marketing reports and in our company strategy marketing .
26249	0	a	And the findings were that we need it to look in a certain way , feel in a certain way , and this is everything is listed down .
26250	0	a	, look in a certain way , feel in a certain way , it has to be technologically innovative and it has to be easy to use .
26251	0	a	These are all things we looked at at the start , and criteria that have to be met .
26252	0	a	We have to use a table ,
26253	1	a	I will show you that later ,
26254	0	a	together to decide whether it meets the standards .
26255	0	a	And we we have therefore in total
26256	0	a	We have five we have eleven points according to which this should be evaluated .
26257	0	a	And the cri well basically the findings are the same as the evaluation criteria .
26258	1	a	I would like to show you the table we have to use .
26259	0	a	No .
26260	0	a	This is the table .
26261	0	a	Can you see this here ?
26262	1	a	so the que the questions I have given you c could you write that down ?
26263	0	a	True is one and and false is seven .
26264	1	a	And we will just go through each point together , hopefully .
26265	1	a	I think if each of us gives an opinion then they can be mixed somehow .
26266	0	a	I dunno how it works exactly , I have not been told .
26267	0	a	Yeah .
26268	0	a	Is it possible that we can bring this up on our own
26269	0	a	Is it meeting three minutes ?
26270	0	a	No it is not minutes .
26271	0	a	Yeah it is in the it is in the project documents .
26272	0	a	It is called evaluation criteria .
26273	0	a	Okay .
26274	0	a	And it is under evaluation .
26275	0	a	Feels like play dough .
26276	0	a	Yeah .
26277	0	a	Okay .
26278	0	a	Cool .
26279	0	a	You have found it all ?
26280	0	a	So it was
26281	0	a	Yeah true is one .
26282	0	a	True is one and false is seven .
26283	1	a	Do you want us to discuss this together or do you want us to do it singly ?
26284	0	a	Yeah okay .
26285	1	a	we can do it separately and then discuss it
26286	0	a	if if that is what people want to do .
26287	0	a	So it is actually a scale .
26288	0	a	Wait , one is true and
26289	0	a	so these are the questions we are answering .
26290	0	a	yes it is if it is fancy
26291	0	a	you put one , if it is really unfancy it is seven .
26292	0	a	And one is
26293	0	a	One , right okay .
26294	0	a	If it is somewhere in between you put four .
26295	0	a	Yeah , something .
26296	0	a	Okay .
26297	0	a	Okay .
26298	0	a	Does it feel fancy ?
26299	0	a	No .
26300	0	a	They should not really be questions .
26301	0	a	Should be more like
26302	0	a	Are the batteries easy to insert ?
26303	0	a	Yes ?
26304	0	a	Very very true .
26305	0	a	I am going to say yes .
26306	0	a	Okay .
26307	0	a	I imagine they are somewhere on the front .
26308	0	a	We have a little case that you slip them in .
26309	0	a	Okay .
26310	0	a	Are we just about ready ?
26311	0	a	I do not think so .
26312	0	a	Apparently I am supposed to use the whiteboard .
26313	0	a	Do we
26314	0	a	is it necessary ?
26315	0	a	We will just do
26316	0	a	Yeah .
26317	0	a	It is
26318	0	a	yeah the the marker thing kind of stopped working last time we
26319	0	a	Our animals will forever be there .
26320	0	a	Yeah .
26321	0	a	Okay .
26322	0	a	Okay .
26323	0	a	Un unless you feel you need it t to
26324	0	a	okay
26325	0	a	okay .
26326	0	a	I do not feel any
26327	0	a	right
26328	0	a	Right so one point one ?
26329	1	a	We will just go in a circle .
26330	0	a	We will
26331	0	a	Five .
26332	0	a	One .
26333	0	a	Kay
26334	0	a	Five .
26335	0	a	Right .
26336	0	a	Ooh I do not know .
26337	0	a	Right .
26338	0	a	One ?
26339	0	a	Five .
26340	0	a	Five .
26341	0	a	Two .
26342	0	a	Okay so do we just add it up and divide it by four ?
26343	0	a	Is that what the company does ?
26344	0	a	Yeah ?
26345	0	a	Oh no .
26346	0	a	I I think we should
26347	0	a	Yeah .
26348	0	a	It is four if you want to do that .
26349	0	a	It adds to sixteen , so that is four .
26350	0	a	Yeah .
26351	0	a	It adds to thirteen .
26352	0	a	One five five two .
26353	0	a	Oh I thought she said five .
26354	0	a	One five five two is thirteen , over four for now .
26355	0	a	I think that is
26356	0	a	next ?
26357	0	a	Really ?
26358	0	a	Two .
26359	0	a	three .
26360	0	a	Six .
26361	0	a	Six .
26362	0	a	Yeah .
26363	0	a	I was not cheating I swear .
26364	0	a	Uh oh .
26365	0	a	Right .
26366	0	a	One point three is
26367	0	a	Yeah .
26368	0	a	So it is a one was true and seven was false ?
26369	0	a	Okay , so you guys really did not like it ?
26370	0	a	I was like , why did you guys design it that way if you hated it ?
26371	0	a	Yeah .
26372	0	a	Huh ?
26373	0	a	Wait a minute .
26374	0	a	I really
26375	0	a	Well
26376	0	a	Yeah yeah .
26377	0	a	Oh I thought it was the other way round .
26378	0	a	I thought it was the other way round too .
26379	0	a	So we do have about the same thing , we just have it the other way
26380	0	a	Oh gosh .
26381	0	a	Sh
26382	0	a	Yeah
26383	0	a	I I was thinking one means no points , you know , all the way up to the top .
26384	0	a	It was one is true and false is seven .
26385	0	a	I should have kept the table up .
26386	1	a	I will just I will just reverse them all .
26387	0	a	Okay .
26388	0	a	Well Yeah .
26389	0	a	It is no problem .
26390	0	a	Right , well I am glad this came out .
26391	0	a	Yeah .
26392	0	a	I thought you guys hated it .
26393	0	a	No .
26394	0	a	Yeah .
26395	0	a	Oh that is quite funny .
26396	0	a	Okay .
26397	0	a	Okay .
26398	0	a	Yeah .
26399	0	a	Okay .
26400	0	a	So , starting again , one point one ?
26401	0	a	Two .
26402	0	a	One .
26403	0	a	Say two .
26404	0	a	Three .
26405	0	a	Okay , one point two ?
26406	0	a	Two .
26407	0	a	three .
26408	0	a	Two .
26409	0	a	Two .
26410	0	a	Okay .
26411	0	a	, one point three ?
26412	0	a	Ha .
26413	0	a	One .
26414	0	a	One .
26415	0	a	One .
26416	0	a	Two point one ?
26417	0	a	Yeah .
26418	0	a	two .
26419	0	a	Two .
26420	0	a	two .
26421	0	a	Two point I think I missed two .
26422	0	a	Wait , is that two point one ?
26423	0	a	One point four , one point five .
26424	0	a	Yeah I put it down as one point four for some reason .
26425	0	a	Oh dear ,
26426	0	a	okay .
26427	0	a	Okay right
26428	0	a	that is I have two of them .
26429	0	a	Sorry .
26430	0	a	Mine has all kinds of problems .
26431	0	a	Two and one .
26432	0	a	Sorry about that .
26433	0	a	T two point two , which is one point five .
26434	0	a	One .
26435	0	a	three .
26436	0	a	Wait why did I put three ?
26437	0	a	I meant one on mine too .
26438	0	a	one .
26439	0	a	Okay .
26440	0	a	Three point one .
26441	0	a	Is that correct on my slide ?
26442	0	a	Yeah ?
26443	0	a	One , four , three , three ,
26444	0	a	three point two ?
26445	0	a	Three point three .
26446	0	a	Yeah .
26447	0	a	Yeah .
26448	0	a	Yeah .
26449	0	a	one .
26450	0	a	Three point one .
26451	0	a	I have four .
26452	0	a	Three .
26453	0	a	Three .
26454	0	a	Three .
26455	0	a	One .
26456	0	a	One .
26457	0	a	One .
26458	0	a	Two .
26459	0	a	Four point one ?
26460	0	a	Two .
26461	0	a	One .
26462	0	a	Two .
26463	0	a	Five .
26464	0	a	Four point two .
26465	0	a	Two .
26466	0	a	Three .
26467	0	a	Four .
26468	0	a	Two
26469	0	a	and four point three .
26470	0	a	Two .
26471	0	a	One , two .
26472	0	a	One .
26473	0	a	Two .
26474	0	a	Right
26475	0	a	so I put one on that .
26476	1	a	Okay I will I will just do the calculations now
26477	1	a	if you want to continue .
26478	0	a	Okay .
26479	0	a	Or is it tedious ?
26480	0	a	I am I am sorry
26481	0	a	this was so tedious for everyone .
26482	0	a	No no that is
26483	1	a	I think we should look at the ones that like where s where people said four , where it looks like we might want to discuss changing an aspect of the remote .
26484	0	a	I did not know how else to do it .
26485	0	a	Okay .
26486	0	a	Well the worst ones were three point one .
26487	0	a	Do
26488	0	a	does every ones have the slide ?
26489	0	a	Three point one .
26490	0	a	The
26491	0	a	that was material .
26492	0	a	Slide show .
26493	0	a	Material technologically innovative ,
26494	0	a	okay .
26495	0	a	do you want to change it ?
26496	1	a	What are the suggestions ?
26497	0	a	I do not know ,
26498	1	a	anyone ?
26499	0	a	Yeah that it is three point one was not that good .
26500	0	a	Which one is that again sorry ?
26501	0	a	Three point one ?
26502	0	a	I think
26503	1	a	What if we just smash all the vegetables down flat ?
26504	0	a	And like then it you could hold it in your hand better .
26505	0	a	Four point one .
26506	0	a	Does the shape
26507	0	a	See I am having I am having trouble imagining
26508	0	a	the
26509	0	a	is it going to be the size , like the the controller ?
26510	0	a	It
26511	0	a	or bigger ?
26512	0	a	Because
26513	0	a	Yeah .
26514	0	a	The shape .
26515	0	a	Four point two ?
26516	0	a	Yeah .
26517	0	a	I think the wheel would probably be .
26518	1	a	I think the base would definitely be larger ,
26519	0	a	cause some of these are not as easy to hold .
26520	0	a	They are kind of smallish .
26521	0	a	No
26522	0	a	but I imagine even if it was bigger , like if it is round and it is big then you you ca not get
26523	0	a	that is why remote controls are long because you have that thumb kind of
26524	1	a	so c they could all be bananas and cucumbers .
26525	0	a	Yeah .
26526	0	a	The flat one .
26527	0	a	Yeah .
26528	0	a	Yeah .
26529	0	a	Yeah .
26530	0	a	but I do not s
26531	0	a	I I personally do not think this is comfortable to to sit there , like it is an awkward position .
26532	0	a	I did not
26533	0	a	yeah .
26534	1	a	But like if if you just squash them flat like and you made it flat
26535	0	a	But it is still too big I think , in your hand .
26536	0	a	Well if they are that s stress ball stuff
26537	0	a	they would be pretty squishable .
26538	0	a	Yeah .
26539	0	a	Yeah .
26540	0	a	And would it even resemble fruit that way ?
26541	0	a	I mean
26542	0	a	Yeah .
26543	0	a	Yeah like certain ones you would have to limit the fruit selection , like you could probably do a strawberry still .
26544	0	a	Yeah .
26545	0	a	I think the broccoli would be out .
26546	0	a	You could do ,
26547	0	a	although the broccoli is quite comfortable , I have to say , like sorta like a joystick .
26548	0	a	Yeah
26549	0	a	that I I when you were holding that before , it actually looked
26550	0	a	yeah .
26551	0	a	That looked really good .
26552	0	a	I do not know .
26553	0	a	So .
26554	0	a	Are there any fruits that look like broccoli , no ?
26555	0	a	I think that broccoli is my favourite actually .
26556	0	a	Not that I can think of .
26557	0	a	Rhubarb .
26558	0	a	Rhubarb .
26559	0	a	These obscure fruits .
26560	0	a	Yeah .
26561	0	a	despite the
26562	0	a	Yeah .
26563	0	a	I think we need not
26564	0	a	Huh ?
26565	0	a	Oh okay .
26566	1	a	What if the it was just patterns on like we we chose the shape or the sh shape could be whatever we wanted
26567	1	a	and then it would just be like a design on the rubber .
26568	0	a	You know like like just a printed yeah or coloured
26569	0	a	yeah .
26570	0	a	So it is just colour , and not necessarily the shape of a strawberry .
26571	0	a	Yeah .
26572	0	a	That could work .
26573	1	a	Or I mean we could even have fruit like around
26574	0	a	I mean But if we if we need
26575	0	a	yeah .
26576	0	a	Yeah .
26577	0	a	Yeah .
26578	0	a	I dunno .
26579	0	a	Yeah
26580	1	a	and just have the colour match or something .
26581	1	a	And if we want to incorporate the fruit thing somehow ,
26582	0	a	there might be
26583	0	a	I mean if it if it in if it conflicts with the comfort of actually holdi holding the
26584	0	a	Yeah .
26585	0	a	Cause
26586	0	a	yeah
26587	0	a	no one wants to hold a remote that is uncomfortable obviously .
26588	0	a	Or like I dunno ,
26589	0	a	some of them you can kind of think see as like
26590	1	a	like you could if it was only this you know , if it was shaped like that , and it just had that .
26591	0	a	But you see the problem is you have to attach that , and this has to be detachable .
26592	0	a	Yeah .
26593	0	a	Yeah .
26594	0	a	So like maybe that is just too big
26595	0	a	because
26596	0	a	Yeah it is sorta like a joystick .
26597	0	a	Well see th the reason the broccoli works is you can kind of hold it like that ,
26598	0	a	which is a nice kind of
26599	0	a	yeah .
26600	0	a	Yeah .
26601	0	a	But
26602	1	a	I mean is there some way we could make it
26603	1	a	this kind of shape ?
26604	0	a	Cause like kind of
26605	0	a	Yeah ,
26606	0	a	yeah .
26607	0	a	I dunno .
26608	0	a	I guess
26609	0	a	Yeah .
26610	1	a	We could make it that shape but just have different colours , and call them the different fruits .
26611	0	a	Yeah .
26612	0	a	Or like even
26613	1	a	Or even like Yeah
26614	1	a	like you said , like a joystick like that .
26615	0	a	Dif
26616	0	a	Yeah .
26617	0	a	We went with shape because we were having fun with the play dough .
26618	0	a	You know ?
26619	0	a	Cause that
26620	0	a	, I think
26621	0	a	I mean that fits the whole round iPod idea .
26622	0	a	Yeah .
26623	0	a	Like we could do
26624	0	a	I am trying to think of other sha like fruits that are oddly shaped .
26625	0	a	Yeah .
26626	0	a	And you still have the comfort of holding it like that .
26627	0	a	Yeah .
26628	1	a	And you could like if it is like this , you could put fruit designs and stuff on that part .
26629	0	a	Yeah .
26630	0	a	Yeah .
26631	0	a	Alright .
26632	0	a	But I mean it
26633	1	a	do we have any other ideas about that ?
26634	0	a	The batteries are going in the back ?
26635	0	a	The reason I I ga
26636	0	a	I did not give it a one
26637	0	a	I think I gave it a three because I thought you would have to like unc clip
26638	0	a	no you could
26639	0	a	Just like any other one .
26640	0	a	Think the critical ones came out to be
26641	0	a	yeah
26642	0	a	that one .
26643	0	a	We could tr
26644	0	a	I do not know .
26645	0	a	Batteries easy to insert for some reason ,
26646	0	a	which can be easily
26647	0	a	I think that is not a problem any more .
26648	0	a	That
26649	0	a	everyone gave that a one or a two .
26650	0	a	Yeah they would probably be either on the front or the side of the remote .
26651	0	a	No .
26652	0	a	No I imagine there would be sort of a hatch door , yeah
26653	0	a	like on a normal remote .
26654	0	a	Okay .
26655	0	a	Yeah .
26656	0	a	Right .
26657	0	a	So it would probably either in the f
26658	0	a	no it ca not be in the front cause the IR is right there ,
26659	0	a	but it would be on one of the sides probably .
26660	0	a	Okay .
26661	0	a	I think everyone is under three anyway .
26662	0	a	So I think it is
26663	0	a	yeah
26664	0	a	those are the only two points .
26665	0	a	Cool .
26666	0	a	Well
26667	0	a	Yeah the broccoli I guess wins .
26668	0	a	Yeah .
26669	0	a	Yeah I would agree with changing the shape .
26670	0	a	, I was just having fun making strawberries and stuff .
26671	0	a	Okay .
26672	0	a	We were a bit off task .
26673	0	a	so I ca not think of any
26674	0	a	So we will have to like .
26675	0	a	Yeah
26676	0	a	I dunno .
26677	1	a	You could make the touch pad in th in different shapes ,
26678	0	a	but then that kind of re designs the whole project like ,
26679	0	a	but you could do like
26680	0	a	Yeah that is true .
26681	0	a	It might also sort of annoy people if we get used to having the buttons in one shape .
26682	0	a	Yeah .
26683	0	a	Yeah .
26684	0	a	And it would probably cost more to produce , cause they are irregular .
26685	0	a	Yeah that is true .
26686	0	a	I bet having different colours is a lot cheaper than having different shapes too .
26687	0	a	Yeah .
26688	0	a	Which is why printing might be like just printing the fruit on fruit .
26689	0	a	Not really
26690	0	a	Well we have done finance evaluation criteria , production evaluation .
26691	0	a	so project evaluation .
26692	0	a	Do you want this and we can all
26693	0	a	No .
26694	0	a	I guess we are supposed to discuss the prod the process of the project and how satisfied
26695	0	a	oh , oh it is alright .
26696	0	a	It is alright yeah ?
26697	0	a	Yeah .
26698	0	a	Yeah .
26699	0	a	Did you feel there was a lot of room for creativity in the sort of
26700	0	a	Yeah .
26701	0	a	Sure .
26702	0	a	I did .
26703	0	a	I mean fruit and squishiness .
26704	0	a	How c more creative can you get ?
26705	0	a	And how was our leadership and teamwork ?
26706	0	a	Well I thought my leadership was crap personally .
26707	0	a	Sponginess .
26708	0	a	The prototype making was very creatively stimulating
26709	0	a	and I think we have come up with a product that is fun and meets all the criteria .
26710	0	a	I think it was good .
26711	0	a	We knew what we were doing .
26712	0	a	It was a very democratic process and everyone got to contribute .
26713	0	a	Excuse me ,
26714	0	a	am I allowed to say that ?
26715	0	a	Yeah .
26716	0	a	Well you told us when to start and when to end , and that is all that matters .
26717	0	a	I think you were fine .
26718	0	a	You did a good job leading .
26719	0	a	Yeah , well I am never going to do a management position , I know that now .
26720	0	a	yeah ,
26721	0	a	I thought we all worked very well together .
26722	0	a	Yeah we did not we it all c sort of blended quite well .
26723	0	a	Yeah .
26724	0	a	Yeah I think it more than anything we did not really have our set roles so much , as we just would be like I do not know , all had ideas about it
26725	0	a	but
26726	0	a	yeah .
26727	0	a	Yeah .
26728	0	a	Very democratic .
26729	0	a	No spats , that was good .
26730	0	a	No .
26731	0	a	and the means for like the materials we used , how convenient were they ?
26732	0	a	Like the the pens , the whiteboard ,
26733	0	a	I mean we used
26734	0	a	Are you a Mac person ?
26735	0	a	Huh .
26736	0	a	Well I am not a big fan of any Microsoft , PowerPoint or any of this stuff .
26737	0	a	No no I never touch Macs either .
26738	0	a	I just use the Unix or the off market , sort of WordPerfect and all these other things .
26739	0	a	Which is not very user friendly though .
26740	0	a	Yeah .
26741	0	a	Well the problem is if you do not like my new computer never has WordPerfect
26742	0	a	so I have to go track someone down who has an old disk
26743	0	a	and then I have to reinstall it .
26744	0	a	So I have all these documents I ca not use now .
26745	0	a	But yeah I mean I guess it is okay .
26746	0	a	I felt like my
26747	0	a	I dunno if it was just my role ,
26748	0	a	but l but I di I thought that my the information that was available to me was kind of just like or maybe it was just the idea that we had .
26749	0	a	But there is kind of
26750	0	a	it was kind of like
26751	0	a	okay , I do not really think
26752	0	a	I dunno what I am doing here .
26753	0	a	So I did not really think it was helpful .
26754	0	a	So I kind of just made up my own stuff
26755	0	a	and I did not really like the PowerPoint presentations ,
26756	0	a	so I kind of wrote a lot of notes instead .
26757	0	a	Yeah .
26758	0	a	But yeah I d I do not really like PowerPoint personally , think it is kind of stupid .
26759	0	a	Yeah .
26760	0	a	Yeah .
26761	0	a	I never use it .
26762	0	a	Yeah
26763	0	a	but
26764	0	a	Yeah .
26765	0	a	I ca not say I found everything particularly helpful .
26766	0	a	Like I
26767	0	a	It
26768	0	a	Really ?
26769	0	a	I mean m my problem
26770	0	a	yeah ,
26771	0	a	yeah .
26772	0	a	It did not really
26773	0	a	yeah .
26774	0	a	Yeah .
26775	0	a	I though it was brilliant no ?
26776	0	a	No mine was really helpful as in my stuff was quite helpful I think .
26777	0	a	My first bit of information was like this child is drawn picture of how a remote works .
26778	0	a	So like a f
26779	0	a	Yeah I think so .
26780	0	a	I think it depends on the role
26781	0	a	no ?
26782	0	a	Yeah .
26783	0	a	Yeah it probably does .
26784	0	a	Cause my problem was , you guys had access to like they would put send you to sites and stuff
26785	0	a	right ?
26786	0	a	See I could not do that , so I did not really know what you guys were doing .
26787	0	a	Yeah .
26788	0	a	And when you were talking about it
26789	0	a	I was just like you know that is wh
26790	0	a	that is why I seemed so ignorant when when you were j explaining things ,
26791	0	a	cause I
26792	0	a	Yeah .
26793	0	a	Yeah well mine was mostly made up except when they told me like you know titanium costs more than wood to make a remote control .
26794	0	a	As if you would wanted to .
26795	0	a	Yeah .
26796	0	a	But it must have been quite difficult for them to build a whole a whole system ,
26797	0	a	cause of course they ca not give you anything comparable to the internet for the
26798	0	a	Yeah ,
26799	0	a	yeah .
26800	0	a	System .
26801	0	a	Yeah .
26802	0	a	Yeah I mean , it
26803	0	a	Yeah
26804	0	a	I kind of thought that
26805	0	a	I felt like I would go and like try to use my information , or like I would make this stupid little presentation and then like I just would end up talking about something completely unrelated
26806	0	a	because I dunno
26807	0	a	I felt like I was off task all the time .
26808	0	a	Yeah .
26809	0	a	Well I think it is interesting how it all went together ,
26810	0	a	like I had the stuff about how me how rubber is cheap , and you have how people want it to be spongy , and
26811	0	a	It seems planned you know .
26812	0	a	Yeah , huh .
26813	0	a	Yeah .
26814	0	a	Yeah .
26815	0	a	But
26816	0	a	Yeah .
26817	0	a	Well I mean we really got into talking about like personal practicalit
26818	0	a	like it was not necessarily what was like
26819	0	a	we would never have thought of fruit or sponginess you know ?
26820	0	a	So it is
26821	0	a	Oh right .
26822	0	a	No .
26823	0	a	Yeah .
26824	0	a	If I had not been told that fruit was They are pretty cool .
26825	0	a	But I think that it it might be to see whether people actually all come up with the same thing .
26826	0	a	given certain information or
26827	0	a	Just
26828	0	a	yeah .
26829	0	a	Yeah , like if everyone is given the same input I do not have a clue , anyway .
26830	0	a	what is next ?
26831	0	a	Looks like
26832	0	a	oh no that is not
26833	0	a	It is quite
26834	0	a	Yeah .
26835	0	a	What do you guys think of the pens ?
26836	0	a	It asks about that .
26837	0	a	They are kind of hard to write with though .
26838	0	a	I want to s
26839	0	a	I I would like to see what what it looks like on the
26840	0	a	Yeah I think I would like to I dunno .
26841	0	a	Yeah
26842	0	a	and I I have f forgotten once or twice to check the box .
26843	0	a	They are nicer than the pen that I am using ,
26844	0	a	because like your stuff actually shows up here , rather than having to look at the screen and write .
26845	0	a	But even so , I dunno .
26846	0	a	And new ideas found ?
26847	0	a	Yeah .
26848	0	a	Yeah it is all very new ,
26849	0	a	no ?
26850	0	a	It is all very new .
26851	0	a	Like it was the
26852	0	a	I think the microphones are okay when you are sitting down , but like they are kind of clumsy
26853	0	a	I guess when you are like when you are s going up to the whiteboard like .
26854	0	a	Sorry .
26855	0	a	Oh yeah .
26856	0	a	Well they drop off if you like move too much .
26857	0	a	Yeah
26858	0	a	I dunno .
26859	0	a	But they are they are okay .
26860	0	a	But I do not think we are supposed to be testing these microphones .
26861	0	a	Maybe we are .
26862	0	a	I do not know .
26863	0	a	I think , and I think that
26864	0	a	all this technology like I guess some people must be interested in using it
26865	0	a	but I ca not imagine finding it any more useful than like looking at someone is notes , or like I dunno .
26866	0	a	Yeah .
26867	0	a	Well the thing is , like I actually worked in a company , and I had a role and
26868	0	a	I had to go to meetings .
26869	0	a	And like the last thing I would have wanted would be to have to watch a video cause I missed a meeting .
26870	0	a	Like usually I missed meetings deliberately .
26871	0	a	There is just
26872	0	a	there is really not that much information that actually goes through a real meeting , like when you are actually at a real meeting in a real company .
26873	0	a	Yeah .
26874	0	a	Hm .
26875	0	a	It is mostly like rehashing old stuff .
26876	0	a	And you are sort of going over general stuff that anybody who is sort of on task should already know .
26877	0	a	Yeah .
26878	0	a	It is like the
26879	0	a	there is just really not a lot of information that goes through .
26880	0	a	Seems kind of like an excessive reiteration .
26881	0	a	It seems like way overkill .
26882	0	a	Yeah .
26883	0	a	Like if I missed a meeting I could probably get it summed up in like one sentence .
26884	0	a	Yeah .
26885	0	a	I would not need to have to watch like a t two hour video with the sound and the transcript and
26886	0	a	I think I have learned not to bring play dough to meetings .
26887	0	a	Yeah .
26888	0	a	I guess it would be
26889	0	a	it is gotta be worth it to
26890	0	a	I
26891	0	a	cause I am just mostly curious about like what kind of person or like company would would really find it useful , cause ca not really imagine , dunno .
26892	0	a	How about a p a ?
26893	0	a	I dunno .
26894	0	a	Well does anyone want to talk about fruit more while we still have time ?
26895	1	a	Any other ideas for
26896	0	a	we still have time if there is any other input .
26897	0	a	What what is the end ?
26898	0	a	Are we are we supposed to
26899	0	a	you supposed to write a report ?
26900	0	a	Or we ending ?
26901	0	a	Is that the end ?
26902	0	a	End of meeting .
26903	0	a	I mean the I think we did really well personally ,
26904	0	a	which is why we have you know , gone through this so quickly .
26905	0	a	Cause
26906	0	a	I mean we have all we all kind of agreed our product is satisfactory
26907	0	a	, it fits the budget , and it is trendy .
26908	0	a	Yeah .
26909	0	a	So .
26910	1	a	You have to tell her ,
26911	0	a	she
26912	0	a	Okay we have to fill in all this stuff .
26913	0	a	So I think that is all for today .
26914	0	a	Stuff stuff stuff .
26915	0	a	M meeting adjourned .
26916	0	a	Meeting adjourned .
26917	0	a	Yeah .
26918	0	a	Yeah .
26919	0	a	It is hard enough to get people actually paying attention .
26920	0	a	Especially if you have food .
26921	0	a	So I guess we are supposed to write final reports .
26922	0	a	Cause
26923	0	a	I do not know .
26924	0	a	Well there is al eight , nine .
26925	0	a	Ooh .
26926	0	a	 
26927	0	a	Right
26928	0	a	w welcome to the the first meeting of Real Reaction is development meetings for our our new television remote control .
26929	0	a	this follows our very successful entry into the the consumer market over the last year or so which we want to to build on , taking advantage of the the the latest developments in in technology and the the latest feelings in in consumer design and and demand and we want to make this the the very best product th that is possible for everybody , one that everybody wants , at a good price for the consumer and at a good price for the company .
26930	1	a	and to that end we need all to work together to do that .
26931	0	a	and b in no particular order because ev everybody is just as vital to this project
26932	1	a	I will just go round th the table ,
26933	0	a	Andrew , marketing , m Kendra with the designing the the the User Interface and Kate with the the industrial design .
26934	0	a	What is the the th th project is is here to do , is is to to get this this project up and moving ,
26935	1	a	ev everybody is is free to say wh whatever they want , everybody has a contribution to make and everybody feel free to interrupt me at any time to to say what you want to say .
26936	0	a	in in terms of the immediate meeting the everybody knows everybody else , everybody is worked for the the company for a while ,
26937	1	a	if if an anybody feels that they need to say more about themselves please do , if if if anybody wants to b briefly give their their background
26938	0	a	so that everybody is quite clear what everybody everybody is experience is
26939	1	a	please do so .
26940	1	a	in fact I would I would I would welcome anybody to say something briefly about themselves , in fact we will do that by by going round the table quickly and and saying what what contribution you you are looking to make .
26941	1	a	So we will start with Andrew .
26942	0	a	Oh
26943	0	a	my name is Andrew
26944	0	a	I am a
26945	0	a	I am the Market Research person for this for this meeting and this project for creating this new remote control
26946	0	a	and
26947	0	a	yeah
26948	0	a	I will be presenting information statistics on what people want to want to get from this new design , what people want to like and from a fashion point of view and the practicality point of view .
26949	0	a	Right
26950	1	a	Kendra .
26951	0	a	I am Kendra and I am the Us User Interface Designer and I have not had a whole lot of experience in this kind of thing before
26952	0	a	but I am m
26953	0	a	so
26954	0	a	I will be working on the design .
26955	0	a	Right
26956	0	a	at least means you have not got any preconceived ideas
26957	0	a	so .
26958	0	a	Right .
26959	0	a	Yep ,
26960	1	a	I am just open to being creative .
26961	0	a	Yep ,
26962	0	a	good .
26963	0	a	I am Katie , I am the Industrial Designer
26964	0	a	and I will just be
26965	0	a	I guess presenting about the the inter workings of our little remote control
26966	0	a	and
26967	0	a	yeah .
26968	0	a	Okay ,
26969	0	a	very very quickly , this
26970	1	a	I do not want to make this meeting too structured
26971	1	a	because the the whole idea is that it is a you know a think tank .
26972	1	a	Everybody says what they what they want to say , and we do not want to be constrained by kind of convention or slides on screens or or anything else
26973	1	a	but briefly th th
26974	1	a	this is what we want to do .
26975	0	a	The the remote control needs to be original , there has to be something about it that other remote controls do not have so that as soon as people see it they think yes that is different
26976	0	a	, I want one , and that goes along with being trendy
26977	0	a	, you know the
26978	0	a	I want it scenario .
26979	0	a	User friendly as as we all know , remote controls can be very user unfriendly so we want to make ours one that people can pick up and think oh yes that is it is obvious how that works , and they also want to look at the price and think
26980	0	a	oh yeah
26981	0	a	that is something that I may not need another remote control
26982	0	a	but it is such a nice one I am going to have one .
26983	1	a	And last but not least , or indeed first of all , it it must make the company money , and we make the company money by producing what the consumer wants .
26984	0	a	The the further work to be done is i the the functional design , what it what it must actually do , the conceptual design , how we actually present that to the consumer and th the the detailed design i is how we get that into production .
26985	0	a	now th the main design tool that we have available to us at the moment is is the white board
26986	1	a	and let us very quickly do what i what it says in the in the in the prompt slide here ,
26987	1	a	In fact I suggest to avoid everybody untangling themselves from the the the wires , that we do not do that ,
26988	0	a	So
26989	0	a	I I
26990	0	a	everybody knows what whiteboard is
26991	1	a	so we will we will do a virtual drawing on the on on the whiteboard of of your your own favourite animal , but le let is go round the table ,
26992	0	a	your favourite animal .
26993	0	a	, badger .
26994	0	a	and why ?
26995	0	a	Uh huh .
26996	0	a	it is it is got nice contrast with black and white
26997	0	a	and I feel they are
26998	0	a	underdog kind of status
26999	0	a	and they are , the
27000	0	a	Make mobile phones and TV remotes to make TV remotes .
27001	0	a	Oh right
27002	0	a	my my wife says my beard looks like a badger is arse cause of the the white streaks in it .
27003	0	a	Kendra .
27004	0	a	probably a duck
27005	0	a	I
27006	0	a	just I li
27007	0	a	I like the way they look
27008	0	a	and they are just nice animals
27009	0	a	and I like how they can fly or swim or walk around or whatever .
27010	0	a	Uh huh .
27011	0	a	Right ,
27012	1	a	okay .
27013	0	a	is horses , no particular reason why .
27014	0	a	Uh huh ,
27015	0	a	fair enough
27016	0	a	yeah .
27017	0	a	I am not sure that I have got any favourite animal to be quite honest , I think homo sapien because of their their overall ability to
27018	0	a	Sorry ?
27019	0	a	Indeed absolutely yes ,
27020	0	a	tha that is
27021	0	a	Okay
27022	0	a	and w we need to keep in mind here that the we want to sell this for for twenty five Euro , we want to m make an overall profit for the the company of fifty million Euros
27023	0	a	so we are we are looking at selling a lot of these ag across the the entire planet
27024	0	a	and and we are looking at a gross profit of fifty percent .
27025	0	a	It needs to cost twelve Euros fifty to make .
27026	0	a	so we are not only looking at a a very trendy original product ,
27027	0	a	we are looking at making it at a very good price .
27028	0	a	, okay ,
27029	1	a	would anybody like t like to to start by giving their o sort of quick views of of current remote controls .
27030	0	a	Well
27031	0	a	I think I find a lot of them really complicated to use with all the different buttons and it is handiest when you have one that works both the DVD player or whatever and the TV as well .
27032	0	a	, but that it is easy to if you can switch back and forth instead of having to press a bunch of different buttons
27033	0	a	and
27034	0	a	so I think it is is best when they are clearly labelled and you can see which buttons you are supposed to use ,
27035	0	a	you know .
27036	0	a	No .
27037	1	a	Any any thoughts about buttons or any oth other way of approaching the p the the problem ?
27038	0	a	Or anybody else , strong feelings about remote controls ?
27039	0	a	Are there you know , bad ones they have used or good ones they have used or ones that they have lost and never found again ?
27040	1	a	what so wh what is in in what particular style features are you thinking about ?
27041	0	a	Uh huh .
27042	1	a	I think it is important that you should be able to when you when you press the buttons it will actually pick up the signals from kind of anywhere
27043	1	a	and you should not have to like contort yourself and twist your remote control to get it the TV to actually pick up the signal .
27044	0	a	Yeah .
27045	0	a	Yeah .
27046	0	a	Think a lot of the time , remotes that come with TV players and TVs and DV players , like they are not like an area that is put a lot of effort into ,
27047	0	a	they are very boring , very plain .
27048	0	a	Like
27049	0	a	it is very a very
27050	0	a	like
27051	0	a	making a a stylish remote control would be a very like Easily put us one step ahead of the current competition .
27052	1	a	Something that looks looks does not look like remote control .
27053	1	a	So if you want , something that looks like something that makes you think
27054	1	a	oh what is this ?
27055	0	a	Like this pen does not really look like a pen , but it makes you think
27056	0	a	oh .
27057	0	a	So ,
27058	0	a	sorry
27059	0	a	that is a bit vague .
27060	0	a	Yeah
27061	0	a	d
27062	0	a	no
27063	0	a	I mean do you think there is a risk if it does not look like remote control , people wo not see it as a remote control
27064	0	a	and
27065	0	a	Uh huh .
27066	1	a	I suppose suppose that is up to the marketing to to make make people aware of the product .
27067	1	a	Any other thoughts about th the physical appearance of a of remote controls ?
27068	0	a	I mean th the thing that i immediately comes to mind is computer mouses which I mean y you get all sorts of shapes in the shops
27069	0	a	and s you know some quite fancy ones
27070	0	a	than the
27071	0	a	some from personal experience which look nice but are not particularly comfortable .
27072	1	a	I think something that is comfortable to hold
27073	0	a	because sometimes you get the remote controls that are just those big , rectangular things
27074	0	a	and they are kind of awkward to hold onto ,
27075	1	a	so something that is more comfortable that fits in a person is hand better .
27076	0	a	Yeah .
27077	0	a	Yeah .
27078	0	a	Yeah .
27079	0	a	Yeah .
27080	1	a	any thoughts about buttons or flat screens or
27081	0	a	Yes ,
27082	0	a	I mean the only thing is if if you are watching television in a in a a darkened room you need to be able to fi find the button buttons easily .
27083	0	a	Well
27084	0	a	from the mouse idea you could ,
27085	0	a	remote is a piece of plastic with the big rubber buttons sticking out of it which you press ,
27086	0	a	whereas if you want
27087	1	a	could all be flat and the buttons are very kind of almost subtle that instead of being raised out of the device you push into device you see , like a mouse button .
27088	0	a	I suppose .
27089	0	a	Easily , yeah yeah .
27090	1	a	But maybe they could be concave instead of sticking up to have them be kind of down
27091	0	a	so you could feel them better .
27092	0	a	Yeah ,
27093	0	a	that is
27094	0	a	must admit I do not think I have ever seen one with concave buttons , that is certainly be different .
27095	0	a	do we need it to
27096	0	a	I ca not think of any re remote controls that I know of that actually light up at all .
27097	0	a	Do we do we want
27098	0	a	Yeah .
27099	0	a	Oh yeah .
27100	0	a	that would be good .
27101	0	a	Like a like a mobile phone ?
27102	0	a	Yeah .
27103	0	a	, yeah that would be good .
27104	0	a	Okay .
27105	0	a	So ,
27106	1	a	Andrew have you had any thoughts yet about how we might market something
27107	0	a	which there are already millions out there and that we want to t take over the entire the planet with ?
27108	0	a	, especially if we try to sell , what two million of them .
27109	0	a	Oh sorry ,
27110	0	a	four million of them ,
27111	0	a	but I think if w if we market it as as not as not
27112	0	a	well
27113	0	a	this you c
27114	0	a	you could either market it as the point of view we could have the two
27115	1	a	we could have parallel marketing s schemes where you have got one where it appeals to people that want to have the new device that looks cool , is fashionable
27116	0	a	and like you just
27117	0	a	it is it is like it is one that rather than ra
27118	0	a	I wan
27119	0	a	I want rather than a kind of a need relationship with the device ,
27120	0	a	but that might
27121	0	a	considering the act what the device is for and the nature of some people might not like respond to having a device that they just looks nice ,
27122	0	a	therefore they want it
27123	1	a	so make it practical at the same time .
27124	0	a	I think it is this is going to have to appeal to people that want device that can enhance their living room but also a device that is practically sound .
27125	0	a	So ,
27126	1	a	I dunno we will have to decide which which angle we are going to go to or both .
27127	0	a	Okay , yeah ,
27128	0	a	yeah ,
27129	0	a	well
27130	1	a	I
27131	1	a	d I think an any any facets that we identify w we aim need to aim for for all of .
27132	0	a	If you .
27133	0	a	okay
27134	0	a	well
27135	1	a	first thoughts on the the industrial design side .
27136	0	a	Oh
27137	0	a	I think it is it is remote controls are kind of a unique object cause it is you depend on them so much ,
27138	0	a	but you do not
27139	0	a	i
27140	0	a	i
27141	0	a	it is
27142	0	a	you sort of just assume they are always going to work ,
27143	0	a	you do not think of them as a comp
27144	0	a	like a computer can break down and you are kind of like oh well fair enough there is all these complex things going on ,
27145	0	a	it is going to
27146	0	a	something is going to get messed up eventually .
27147	1	a	They they just need to be very very dependable
27148	0	a	because people sort of take them for granted and then if your remote control breaks it is God forbid you actually get up and manually change the channel
27149	0	a	it just
27150	1	a	it needs to be very effective , very always dependable .
27151	0	a	Indeed .
27152	1	a	I do not think we should make it too small
27153	0	a	I cause I think it needs to
27154	0	a	it ca not be too big like you were saying big an and huge and awkward ,
27155	0	a	but also if you make it too small kind of like you know how mobile phones are getting smaller and smaller , it is just going to end up under a couch cushion somewhere
27156	0	a	and
27157	0	a	yeah .
27158	0	a	Yeah .
27159	0	a	But
27160	0	a	so
27161	0	a	yes
27162	1	a	dependable , and have a good medium range size .
27163	0	a	Okay ,
27164	1	a	and colours , materials ?
27165	1	a	Kendra , anyone ?
27166	0	a	Well ,
27167	0	a	most I think most of the remote controls now are either just black or grey ,
27168	1	a	so maybe we should go with something different
27169	0	a	or be able to
27170	1	a	I was just thinking of what they are doing with mobile phones now
27171	0	a	how you can get the different what are they called ?
27172	0	a	Like the face plates that you change
27173	0	a	so we could have maybe
27174	0	a	I do not know if it would be feasible to do something with that ,
27175	1	a	where you can change the face plates or have kind of a variety so people can get different different things .
27176	0	a	Yeah .
27177	0	a	Uh huh .
27178	1	a	Have it kind of look how they want to , different colours , things like that , probably just plastic
27179	0	a	because that is always the lightest .
27180	0	a	Right .
27181	0	a	Yeah .
27182	0	a	Okay
27183	0	a	that is
27184	0	a	Again I do not think that is ever been done before ,
27185	0	a	it is the sort of the sort of thing that would get people thinking yes that is something that I have not got and might need
27186	0	a	so .
27187	1	a	Andrew , any thoughts about how we might market interchangeable fronts on on the remote control ?
27188	0	a	Yeah .
27189	0	a	, well
27190	1	a	we could either market it together by getting control in a set colour
27191	0	a	or with like you buy it with several
27192	0	a	like
27193	1	a	you ge you get the f the face plates with it when you buy or as a separate thing ,
27194	0	a	but maybe thinking of that , it is considering the nature of the device , maybe a second thing like a second campaign to market new facials for your to your might go a bit astray
27195	0	a	since it is the kind of thing where y you generally get one and then forget about it .
27196	0	a	Unless you were trying to
27197	0	a	Yeah .
27198	0	a	Well
27199	1	a	you could come up with like novelty ones ,
27200	0	a	like they have done with the the mobile phones ,
27201	1	a	you can get like different you know scenes from different movies and stuff on the remote control and sorta stagger the release of them and get people like
27202	1	a	oh I want that cover on it now
27203	0	a	and that will keep them spending money .
27204	0	a	I think
27205	0	a	Mm mm .
27206	0	a	Yeah .
27207	0	a	Oh
27208	0	a	it is
27209	0	a	that is a that is a good idea .
27210	0	a	Yeah .
27211	0	a	Right , okay
27212	0	a	I think we have got a good idea now .
27213	0	a	Yeah true .
27214	0	a	We
27215	1	a	meeting is Needs to be k wrapped up fairly quickly .
27216	0	a	So
27217	0	a	we have got thirty minutes to start looking at the at the design in more detail .
27218	0	a	then we will we will reconvene in in thirty minutes and try to get some of these ideas more formalised .
27219	0	a	 
27220	0	a	Okay ,
27221	0	a	welcome to the second meeting of this design group .
27222	1	a	I will briefly go through the notes of the of the last meeting
27223	0	a	just done in in note form
27224	0	a	and I have not attributed anything to individuals , because we are working strictly as a team here
27225	0	a	and n nobody is working equally ,
27226	0	a	so .
27227	0	a	Sorry .
27228	0	a	we we s we saw that the the problems with existing remote controls were the b a boring shape and boring colour .
27229	0	a	and and we s
27230	0	a	we saw that the what we needed to do was to to make sure the device controls several items , that switching was easy , that you should not need to point the thing at anything in particular , that it need to be contoured to make it interesting , that the keys might be concave , simply because that has not been done before that we know of .
27231	0	a	should have interchangeable fascias so people can personalise it , illuminated so that people can see it in dark rooms .
27232	0	a	and that people might want it as as in addition to their existing remote controls .
27233	0	a	and that it sh it should just always work , whenever you use it .
27234	0	a	And that it should not be too small , that it it gets lost .
27235	0	a	Now
27236	1	a	I will shortly ask for for three three presentations .
27237	1	a	before I do that , however , I will go through some new project requirements
27238	0	a	that the the management have placed on us
27239	0	a	and will be challenging in terms of what we discussed at the first meeting .
27240	0	a	the the ma the management has had it is own thoughts on this and the they do not necessarily agree with with what we we thought .
27241	0	a	and
27242	0	a	and then we will
27243	1	a	as a result of that we will then talk through the the functions that we see the the device actually b carrying out ,
27244	0	a	and we have forty minutes to do this in
27245	0	a	and I
27246	0	a	Anyway .
27247	0	a	Okay .
27248	0	a	Now ,
27249	0	a	the n the new requirements are the the management team see that teletext is no longer of any importance given the the rise of the internet .
27250	0	a	and and they want it only to cover televisions .
27251	0	a	now ,
27252	0	a	what is not q quite clear from their directive is
27253	0	a	whether they mean th they do not want it to cover teletext
27254	0	a	or whether they do not want it to cover , you know , videos , DVDs , satellite boxes , which I mean we saw as being fundamental to the to the exercise .
27255	0	a	The the actual wording of the directive is that it should cover television only .
27256	1	a	and on that basis I
27257	1	a	I think we we need to bear that in mind ,
27258	0	a	but possibly keep at the backs of our minds that the reality that people even when they no longer they do not look at teletext anymore , they certainly do look at other things .
27259	0	a	the device has to incorporate the company logo and colours .
27260	0	a	the the logo being at b the bottom of the screen there , the the the two Rs in grey against a yellow background .
27261	0	a	now
27262	1	a	this does not necessarily mean that we have to give up some of our ideas about making it attractive to the t to the market .
27263	0	a	But do do introduce some some constraints as to how we might do that .
27264	1	a	it also has to be simple ,
27265	0	a	which to some extent goes along w with the first one , and that we have already said that it must be simple cause that is what people want anyway .
27266	0	a	but they also want it to be simple to get it to the market quickly , which is is is their choice ,
27267	1	a	but we we need to talk that through .
27268	0	a	okay , so
27269	1	a	after the meeting it will be summarised and notes sent out and etcetera .
27270	0	a	Okay , so
27271	0	a	we will first of all have individual reports from everybody .
27272	0	a	again I
27273	0	a	there is no order of precedence here
27274	1	a	so I
27275	1	a	I
27276	1	a	I will leave it up to you to who who who thinks they would like to go go first ?
27277	0	a	P
27278	0	a	fine .
27279	1	a	I do not mind .
27280	0	a	can I steal the cable ?
27281	0	a	Cheers .
27282	0	a	Oh sorry ,
27283	0	a	you can indeed .
27284	0	a	I got a
27285	0	a	how do I start there ?
27286	0	a	That one .
27287	0	a	Oh ,
27288	1	a	if you click on the the one that that looks like a projection screen ,
27289	0	a	no
27290	1	a	the one to the right of that .
27291	0	a	That one .
27292	0	a	Cool .
27293	0	a	Well
27294	0	a	these are functionality requirements from the our our guys down in the the research lab .
27295	0	a	Took hundred people and covered all the aspects of what is needed by people and what they want to see .
27296	0	a	everything kind of from functionality and how individual functions are how mu how how often they are used and how much their necessary and stuff .
27297	0	a	And general opinions about current current remotes .
27298	0	a	See that , as we kind of noticed , seventy five percent of people find their remote controls ugly .
27299	1	a	So some kind of a new style should be incorporated that is less ugly .
27300	0	a	along with looking less ugly , if it looks better , eighty percent of people said they would spend more money on it .
27301	0	a	Which is a a plus for us ,
27302	0	a	if we can make it look better , it would be more cost effective and we can put the price up .
27303	0	a	Current remote controls do not match the operating behaviour of the user .
27304	0	a	I can empl
27305	0	a	I kind of take that to mean as they they do not they ,
27306	0	a	yeah , they only use they only work for the television
27307	0	a	or
27308	0	a	yeah like
27309	0	a	as in in my flat I have got six remote controls for a stereo system , a digital box , a DVD player , a video player and TV .
27310	0	a	If it was
27311	0	a	I mean th my behaviour is to use multiple things at the same time
27312	0	a	and multiple remotes are not really matched well to my behaviour .
27313	0	a	again , seventy five percent is seventy five percent of users say they zap a lot .
27314	0	a	I took to mean that they just they use it a lot , they use it regularly rather than standing up and manually change channels or volume .
27315	0	a	And yeah ,
27316	0	a	I think the big issue is fifty percent users only use ten percent of the buttons ,
27317	0	a	cause wh if we got a remote that like
27318	0	a	well
27319	0	a	we will have some buttons taken off by the lack of teletext , but oh and we are going to see on the that some of the functions like audio settings are not h hardly ever used
27320	0	a	and used very
27321	0	a	are not considered relevant by the user .
27322	1	a	So I think maybe fewer buttons ,
27323	0	a	which also make the design look sleeker , I dunno .
27324	0	a	yeah and
27325	0	a	frustrations of like people losing remote control .
27326	0	a	I dunno
27327	1	a	maybe some kind of system of you press a button on the TV
27328	0	a	or maybe that is b
27329	1	a	it would have to incorporate , but like some kind of system where you can f use something else to find the remote control .
27330	1	a	Maybe like it will beep or something .
27331	0	a	And , yep ,
27332	0	a	the time taken to learn new remote controls is
27333	1	a	do not want to make it too complicated , easy to use for new like first time users and stuff .
27334	0	a	And repetitive strain injury ,
27335	1	a	I suppose we should make it more comfortable and make ma possibly even use have to make it , yeah , fewer buttons ,
27336	0	a	like I was saying about the whole mice the mouse idea of it feels more comfortable .
27337	1	a	Maybe do not even have to hold it as such .
27338	0	a	Gosh ,
27339	0	a	must be some telly addicts out there if they get RSI from their television remote , is all I can say .
27340	0	a	But yeah .
27341	0	a	It also asked if we would if people would pay more for speech recognition and younger people say they would .
27342	0	a	And there was another section on our on the report for LCD displays , but the data was not there , so .
27343	0	a	I do not actually know what the results for that were ,
27344	0	a	so .
27345	0	a	Right .
27346	0	a	May be incrementally emitting ,
27347	0	a	but yeah .
27348	0	a	Yeah ,
27349	0	a	I must say that the I c ca not remember what f you know phone service
27350	0	a	I was using the other day , but that had sorta speech recognition
27351	0	a	which worked remarkably well ,
27352	1	a	so that is indeed a a thought
27353	0	a	and it
27354	0	a	it cuts out
27355	0	a	I was was going to say , you ca not get a lot of RSI ,
27356	0	a	j just get jaw ache .
27357	0	a	And it would cut out the RSI as well if you
27358	0	a	Yeah ,
27359	0	a	oh yeah ,
27360	0	a	so
27361	1	a	possibly the speech recognition is possibly something could add into the design .
27362	0	a	Okay ,
27363	0	a	sorry .
27364	0	a	Oh ,
27365	1	a	I have got some other things
27366	0	a	I could not fit onto this presentation .
27367	0	a	You see this okay ?
27368	0	a	Almost
27369	0	a	no ?
27370	0	a	It is
27371	0	a	sorry
27372	0	a	it is a bit .
27373	1	a	I will read out to you .
27374	0	a	functionality , like people is opinions on functionality , the relevance to the remote and how often they are used .
27375	0	a	So
27376	0	a	like the power .
27377	0	a	Using the using the d swi the power switch to switch on TV is a high relevance of nine , but it is not frequently used .
27378	0	a	You see what I mean ?
27379	0	a	Whereas channel selection , which is very high relevance is used the most .
27380	0	a	Yeah .
27381	0	a	So
27382	0	a	m we can maybe even start to cut down on or
27383	1	a	I was possibly even thinking of a design that maybe some of the buttons are hidden from everyday use .
27384	1	a	Maybe like a folding ledge or something .
27385	1	a	So that we can maybe go into the channel settings and the audio settings ,
27386	0	a	which are low relevance and rarely used .
27387	1	a	And keep the v volume selection and channel selection very easily
27388	0	a	Oh yeah .
27389	0	a	It could be
27390	0	a	oh
27391	1	a	I was just going to say maybe like the flip phones that they use ?
27392	0	a	Have you seen the new mo mobile phones
27393	0	a	that flip out and they have the like texting , and then the numbers on one side ,
27394	0	a	so
27395	1	a	you could have the most used buttons on top and flip it out or something .
27396	0	a	I mean
27397	0	a	Yeah .
27398	0	a	Yeah ,
27399	0	a	like the one that like slides back and the buttons are concealed underneath .
27400	0	a	Yeah .
27401	0	a	Should we actually bite the bullet here ?
27402	1	a	If people really do not use those buttons to any extent at all remove them altogether .
27403	1	a	Just remove them completely ?
27404	0	a	yeah .
27405	0	a	That might be the Maybe i
27406	0	a	Yeah ,
27407	0	a	have a big kind of like the satellite box or the cable box
27408	1	a	and have it just go on the TV
27409	0	a	and then it does not matter where in the room you are ,
27410	0	a	you wo not lose it .
27411	0	a	We we could actually have we could actually have a remote control with
27412	0	a	I wonder whether we could get the remote control with no buttons at all if we went for voice recognition ,
27413	0	a	given that the
27414	0	a	now
27415	0	a	the the age structure we were looking at
27416	0	a	I mean w we had usage by age structure ,
27417	0	a	what we did not have was what proportion of people using remotes were in those particular age groups .
27418	0	a	Now
27419	0	a	do we know whether they Forty
27420	0	a	no sorry for forty five to fifty five age group , to put myself right in the middle of it ,
27421	0	a	u use remote controls to a great extent .
27422	0	a	Yes we
27423	0	a	That would have speech recogn right .
27424	0	a	no this is for pay more for speech recognition .
27425	0	a	So ,
27426	0	a	we are looking at
27427	0	a	well
27428	0	a	again , we do not know the relative proportion the relative numbers in the age groups .
27429	0	a	Yeah , that is true .
27430	0	a	If we wanted something different , truly different , then the buttonless remote control w would be it .
27431	0	a	P
27432	0	a	Well
27433	0	a	the only problem I can think of with that is if you have got a lot of people that do not want to be bothered learning how to use new rem remote controls .
27434	0	a	If you just kind of take away everything that they are used to knowing , that is going to be quite a change .
27435	0	a	But if you just lift it up and say , channel one or BBC
27436	0	a	It c
27437	0	a	well
27438	0	a	it
27439	0	a	I can I can see technical problems with that in terms of the , you know , the sound from the television ,
27440	0	a	because if somebody actually on the television says , you know , ITV and you are watching BBC then then it might change itself ,
27441	1	a	so it probably needs to be possibly actually need a button on it just to activate it .
27442	0	a	It might
27443	1	a	Or even I mean you could even just have it left on .
27444	1	a	You could just put it down once on top your TV and never have to
27445	0	a	Yeah .
27446	0	a	No .
27447	0	a	Yeah .
27448	0	a	BBC one .
27449	0	a	Oh .
27450	0	a	Yeah .
27451	0	a	Yeah , that is true .
27452	0	a	Oh yeah .
27453	1	a	Or or something just to identify that you have lifted it up and it is use .
27454	0	a	And and then just say , oh I do not know , a thought and and then
27455	0	a	I mean that that would certainly be truly different .
27456	0	a	Yeah .
27457	0	a	cause you know audio settings , nought point eight percent .
27458	0	a	I mean if they were not there , would people miss them ?
27459	0	a	Vol volume ,
27460	0	a	yes
27461	0	a	th
27462	1	a	w we need to s identify things that people actually need
27463	0	a	and and it is a function of frequency and relevance .
27464	0	a	Mm mm .
27465	1	a	But look at the importance of them .
27466	1	a	The volume settings .
27467	0	a	Relevance of two out of ten ,
27468	0	a	yeah .
27469	0	a	Yeah .
27470	0	a	They are not used often but they are quite important when they are used .
27471	0	a	Yeah .
27472	1	a	And I would say ignoring ig ignoring power for the moment ,
27473	0	a	the channel and volume
27474	0	a	and th w w given given that we have been told to ignore teletext .
27475	0	a	Yeah .
27476	0	a	channel and volume are the only ones that would appear to be essential .
27477	0	a	Stand out .
27478	0	a	So
27479	1	a	if we can design something that that looks interesting ,
27480	0	a	know ,
27481	1	a	or looks different , incorporates the the logo and and the colours and we can still have our interchangeable fascias even if it is the yellow and grey ,
27482	0	a	and I dunno ,
27483	1	a	buttons or or buttons as an option .
27484	0	a	I just had a thought actually ,
27485	0	a	sorry to interrupt .
27486	0	a	Do , please .
27487	0	a	you were saying about it could technical problems of like someone on the television saying a channel number and it changed
27488	1	a	we could maybe have like an activation word .
27489	0	a	Cause I have seen I have seen this used on computers before ,
27490	1	a	where you just you address the remote ,
27491	0	a	you address the computer ,
27492	1	a	and then give it a command .
27493	0	a	You cer certainly could .
27494	0	a	Depe i depends whether
27495	0	a	if we want to make this so simple that anybody can walk into the room and lift it up and say BBC one .
27496	0	a	Oh I see .
27497	0	a	Oh yeah , I see .
27498	0	a	okay ,
27499	1	a	I mean you could print actually print it on the device itself .
27500	0	a	, yeah .
27501	0	a	I mean I am just thinking of the point of view of peop you could still like lose this remote .
27502	0	a	S
27503	0	a	th this I th that is always going to be a problem I think .
27504	0	a	and I I
27505	0	a	I s
27506	0	a	so
27507	0	a	I suppose one could make it so desirable that if people lose it they immediately go out and buy another one .
27508	0	a	Anyway ,
27509	0	a	sorry ,
27510	1	a	carry on .
27511	0	a	Do you want to just carry on with
27512	0	a	or
27513	0	a	no no , no
27514	0	a	b I was in the middle of in the middle of your report there .
27515	0	a	Oh
27516	0	a	no
27517	0	a	I I interrupted you ,
27518	0	a	sorry .
27519	0	a	Oh
27520	0	a	okay .
27521	0	a	well ,
27522	0	a	I was just kind of wrapping up there .
27523	0	a	Yeah ,
27524	0	a	I was thinking , yeah , maybe such things are relevant .
27525	0	a	okay .
27526	0	a	We could make things much more f I think the the
27527	0	a	eighty percent of people would spend more on a remote that looks better ,
27528	0	a	combined with decrease the or
27529	1	a	take out the limited functio functions
27530	0	a	that we do not really use much .
27531	0	a	alright take out teletext ,
27532	0	a	but as for channel settings and stuff
27533	0	a	it might it might turn people somewhe peop some people that want the whole functionality away .
27534	0	a	But , since if we are marketing a more kind of fashionable approach then it would it would be fashion and fashion over practicality .
27535	1	a	S s
27536	1	a	we could we could make it dual function voice recognition and still have buttons on it
27537	0	a	cause we are
27538	0	a	Certainly could .
27539	0	a	Oh , we could , yeah .
27540	0	a	We c
27541	0	a	yeah ,
27542	1	a	we could even have it as like a
27543	1	a	yeah
27544	1	a	the buttons control this and the voice functions control the f things that you would do all the time ,
27545	0	a	so .
27546	0	a	So yeah ,
27547	0	a	if we could power on and channel selection and and volume selection , would not have to really
27548	0	a	Yeah and probably it would look better as well .
27549	0	a	Yeah ,
27550	0	a	yeah .
27551	0	a	The I mean the the advantage of doing away the buttons altogether is it makes the thing cheaper .
27552	0	a	No ,
27553	0	a	it cou certainly opens up the possibility for making it , you know , visually very distinctive .
27554	0	a	Yeah .
27555	1	a	cause you know , it does not have to be a oblong box .
27556	0	a	yeah .
27557	1	a	Lined with numbered buttons and
27558	0	a	yeah ,
27559	0	a	yeah , that is everything .
27560	0	a	, yeah .
27561	0	a	Okay ,
27562	0	a	who
27563	0	a	sorry ,
27564	0	a	have you have you finished there Andy ?
27565	0	a	Yep , yep .
27566	0	a	given that we have already had a extensive discussion .
27567	0	a	Okay well ,
27568	1	a	I can do mine .
27569	0	a	Do you want the cable ?
27570	1	a	F eight .
27571	0	a	Yeah ,
27572	1	a	let is see if I can make this work .
27573	0	a	Oh ,
27574	1	a	you have to hit like function and F something .
27575	0	a	Oh .
27576	0	a	F eight .
27577	0	a	Is it doing
27578	0	a	Okay .
27579	0	a	Dunno .
27580	1	a	, give it about twenty seconds , or so .
27581	0	a	there we go .
27582	0	a	Oh yeah ,
27583	0	a	it is going .
27584	0	a	Oh okay .
27585	0	a	Okay , so
27586	0	a	this is just about the technical functions .
27587	0	a	Alright .
27588	0	a	So
27589	0	a	the method , I looked online for examples of other similar products and then just kind of was trying to brainstorm some possible design ideas and identify what the necessary things are , what people are what you really want to have a remote control do .
27590	0	a	and then there are two different kinds that I found .
27591	0	a	There is a user centred one and an engineering centred one which I will have pictures of
27592	1	a	and then we kind of have to decide which one this should be .
27593	0	a	So
27594	0	a	these are the two different ones .
27595	0	a	This one this is the user centred , it has quite a few fewer buttons and then this is the engineering centred , which has a lot more buttons , and probably this is one that people complain about , about having too many buttons that you do not use .
27596	0	a	So basically ,
27597	0	a	what a remote control is is you
27598	0	a	it is to send messages to the television set ,
27599	0	a	you know ,
27600	0	a	turn on , off , switch the channels and the volume and things such as that .
27601	0	a	And so for this product it is going to be television only , and then it has to have the logos for the company and the colours .
27602	0	a	And so ,
27603	0	a	for my personal preferences , I think this one is easier to use and has quite a you know , fewer buttons .
27604	0	a	we want something that sends messages easily to the television and I was kind of wondering about this example that they have .
27605	0	a	It looks kind of narrow at the top ,
27606	1	a	and I was thinking maybe if it were wider at the top ,
27607	0	a	then that would be easier .
27608	0	a	, yeah .
27609	0	a	and so
27610	1	a	we have to decide what is going to make our product different .
27611	0	a	E
27612	1	a	the unique style , maybe have it light up
27613	0	a	so it is visible in the dark ,
27614	1	a	the changeable face plates ,
27615	0	a	and the lighting up and visible
27616	0	a	I was
27617	0	a	when we were talking about havi losing it ,
27618	1	a	maybe to have a button on the television that you press and
27619	1	a	it maybe if it makes a noise or lights up or something like that ,
27620	0	a	so it is easier to find if someone has hidden under the couch or something like that .
27621	0	a	So
27622	0	a	that is my presentation .
27623	0	a	Yeah .
27624	0	a	Okay ,
27625	0	a	can I I am actually going to use the
27626	0	a	it is going to cause great technical problems over here .
27627	1	a	I am actually going to use the
27628	0	a	Yes ,
27629	0	a	rather than the the the traditional
27630	1	a	in fact , I wo not even go that far .
27631	0	a	F
27632	0	a	they probably clip to you .
27633	0	a	Oh yeah ,
27634	0	a	they might be movable .
27635	0	a	Yeah .
27636	0	a	Oh yeah ,
27637	0	a	they are all
27638	0	a	they are not connected to anything on the table , you just leave them on and walk around with them .
27639	1	a	something like this shape ,
27640	0	a	you know ,
27641	1	a	sort of something that you can that is sort of a more vertical shape , that you you sort of hold in your hand ,
27642	0	a	, well
27643	0	a	I am trying to think
27644	1	a	l l such as I mean something you hold up like that , possibly with a couple of buttons like that , but with the the entire top with the , you know , the the infrared or whatever source .
27645	1	a	so that you know , it is flying off in all directions ,
27646	0	a	so that
27647	1	a	again the n need to look at the the the technicalities of actually achieving that in terms of whether the , you know , the power requirements of the such a source , you know , compromise the our our need for you know , it it being permanently you know , available .
27648	0	a	whether whether different technology
27649	0	a	I mean th all all these remotes are presumably infrared , and like they have been for a long time .
27650	1	a	we we possibly need to be looking at at at something different , you know , short range , not like the old radio remote controls
27651	0	a	where you would change next door is telly when you change yours .
27652	0	a	but I think basically
27653	0	a	i if we are going for i
27654	1	a	if minimum number of buttons is our priority , then we should , as I say , r know , really bite the bullets and and reduce the buttons to absolute minimum ,
27655	0	a	you know ,
27656	1	a	possibly with backup channel and volume buttons and on off .
27657	1	a	and nothing else .
27658	1	a	so that it can al it could almost end up like that ,
27659	0	a	but again , except that you know the risk of losing it .
27660	0	a	anyway okay
27661	0	a	so
27662	1	a	Kate , wh what are your your thoughts on this ?
27663	0	a	Okay .
27664	0	a	Yes , .
27665	0	a	Oh .
27666	0	a	Which one does this plug into ?
27667	0	a	That one .
27668	0	a	I think it is all there .
27669	0	a	H
27670	0	a	Oh yeah .
27671	0	a	I ca not did you
27672	0	a	could you see it on you screen
27673	0	a	when it
27674	0	a	That is not cool .
27675	0	a	That is kind of strange .
27676	0	a	Oh well .
27677	0	a	Anyways .
27678	0	a	alright , yeah , so
27679	1	a	I will just do my presentation on the working design .
27680	0	a	Oh there we go .
27681	0	a	Okay
27682	0	a	just at the m
27683	0	a	yeah
27684	0	a	the whole sort of method of how the remote control works .
27685	0	a	the basic function of the remote control is to send messages to another sh system , the the TV or the DVD player or whatever .
27686	0	a	and it does this by
27687	0	a	well , you need to start off you need an energy source and this energy source will feed into an integrated circuit chip and the circuit chip is the part that actually composes the different messages within the remote which will then be sent to the the television , the DVD to tell that what to do .
27688	0	a	and you need a user interface , which controls the chip and thus the messages and the user interface is that is basically just
27689	0	a	you kn
27690	0	a	the s sorta design of the actual remote which you hold in your hands and what buttons will be on it .
27691	0	a	Oh shoot .
27692	0	a	Okay .
27693	0	a	just general findings .
27694	0	a	what we need technically speaking for the remote control is some sort of energy source , some sort of user interface , which I think we have mostly been talking about the user interface and the design of that .
27695	0	a	a circuit chip within that to control and send the messages and a sender and receiver .
27696	0	a	And
27697	0	a	oops .
27698	0	a	Uh huh .
27699	0	a	This is just sort of a little schematic diagram of what we are looking for .
27700	0	a	this just kind of represents the energy source which feeds into the circuit chip which maybe then we could have that feed into a switch which would send signals f to a subcomponent and on to a light bulb between so it will light up once we start once you start pressing buttons .
27701	0	a	also send signals to the infrared bulb , which will be the part that actually what ?
27702	0	a	Sends signals to the the television .
27703	0	a	And then you have got your happy little TV watcher there .
27704	0	a	And so
27705	1	a	my personal preferences
27706	1	a	I I just think we need sorta big energy source that wo not die out , perhaps some sort of rechargeable battery or a battery dock you could place it in ,
27707	0	a	so it would constantly be charged , so you would not have to be worrying about it running out of batteries and not changing channels for you .
27708	1	a	a wide range sender receiver ,
27709	0	a	so that you can hit the buttons from basically anywhere in the room , and the channel will still be changed .
27710	1	a	also definitely a user friendly interface
27711	0	a	and I think we have all sort of mentioned adding a a locating device on it , so when it does get stuck under the couch cushions , as they inevitably do , you can find them easily .
27712	0	a	And that is pretty much it .
27713	1	a	it seems seems to me there are a number of fundamental decisions to make
27714	0	a	before we
27715	0	a	I think your point about the the big energy source is a very valid one .
27716	0	a	I do not suppose we have got any statistics on the the life expectancy of remote controls , particularly sort of independent ones .
27717	0	a	given you know , the number of things you buy these days , which you know , have a a a lithium whatever battery in , that is , you know never needs replacing .
27718	1	a	perhaps we should have the the disposable remote control ,
27719	0	a	you know , one some sort of typical usage .
27720	0	a	You know ,
27721	1	a	the the the battery will last know , five , ten years .
27722	0	a	By which time I mean when all is said and done , the digital television will be taking over in that time scale .
27723	1	a	p perhaps we should , know , reduce the , you know , the sort of moving parts even more by not even having a battery compartment
27724	0	a	and
27725	0	a	Yeah ,
27726	1	a	and if if anybody manages to run it down , we will we will give them a new one .
27727	0	a	Just having one that is guaranteed to last five to ten years ?
27728	0	a	Oh , cool .
27729	0	a	Yeah , fair enough .
27730	0	a	it is , you know , it is what it saves in cost
27731	0	a	and you know there there is a
27732	0	a	well ,
27733	0	a	it is actually a marketing gimmick .
27734	0	a	I mean it is hardly a gimmick ,
27735	0	a	it is it is totally practical .
27736	0	a	so I th think you know the idea of a rechargeable one is
27737	1	a	unless you are really high tech and it sort of just recharges itself if it is n by , you know , magnetic waves or whatever ,
27738	0	a	if if it
27739	0	a	Yeah .
27740	1	a	It could have like know like a cordless phone in your house it s got like a base that sits there all the time .
27741	0	a	Are are people really going to use it though ? .
27742	0	a	I suppose , yeah .
27743	0	a	Yeah ,
27744	0	a	people are pro
27745	0	a	I would think that people might forget I mean people forget to put their cordless phones back on there ,
27746	0	a	so .
27747	0	a	yeah
27748	0	a	I I th
27749	0	a	I think
27750	0	a	Yeah ,
27751	0	a	it is
27752	0	a	I mean I know
27753	0	a	that somei times my my wife goes out in the morning and says oh I should have put the phone on to charge
27754	0	a	and then then she is had those for so long that if she has not worked that out by now .
27755	0	a	Mm mm .
27756	0	a	Yeah .
27757	0	a	Cause I only remember to charge my cell phone when battery dies .
27758	0	a	And that is pretty much
27759	0	a	yeah .
27760	0	a	Yeah .
27761	0	a	When it
27762	0	a	yeah ,
27763	0	a	wh when it is died is a problem .
27764	0	a	Yeah ,
27765	0	a	when it turns itself off , that is when I plug it in ,
27766	0	a	yeah .
27767	0	a	Yeah , yeah ,
27768	0	a	yeah ,
27769	0	a	so
27770	0	a	what so wh what what do we think about the the the permanent battery ?
27771	0	a	Is the
27772	0	a	you know ,
27773	0	a	we we we are really going for the ultimate in ex external simplicity here .
27774	0	a	Yeah , think that is a good idea .
27775	0	a	That sounds pretty good , yeah .
27776	0	a	No .
27777	0	a	you know ,
27778	0	a	cut cost within the manufacturing and you know , if we have a high tech interior , then then that that sh may well be cost effective .
27779	0	a	Do they make batteries that last that long ?
27780	0	a	Yeah , they have that little solar
27781	0	a	Yeah .
27782	0	a	I mean
27783	0	a	th th
27784	0	a	certainly .
27785	0	a	I ca not think of anything off the s top of my head , but there are certainly things that you buy .
27786	0	a	I mean calculators for example .
27787	0	a	They usually have the little light source , I dunno what the heck they are called ,
27788	0	a	the
27789	0	a	but
27790	0	a	yeah ,
27791	0	a	the little cells
27792	0	a	that
27793	0	a	Yeah .
27794	0	a	Som well some do ,
27795	0	a	I mean
27796	0	a	th th
27797	0	a	but there are battery ones that are you know , sort of permanently sealed .
27798	0	a	In in fact I would
27799	0	a	Yeah ,
27800	0	a	Yeah , I
27801	0	a	I mean
27802	1	a	th th this needs going t into the technology a bit .
27803	0	a	Most of them , do not they have sort of a combination of the two ,
27804	0	a	like
27805	0	a	when there is light , they will work off the light , and if there is not , they will kick into this battery ,
27806	1	a	so we can maybe do something like that whereas there is a battery , but if there is enough light , then it is using the light ,
27807	0	a	so that it is not actually draining the battery all the time , but you will have the battery there for when you need it .
27808	0	a	I mean the the actual time that a remote control is actually operating I would think is i is is probably , you know , no more than minutes in its entire life .
27809	0	a	Oh ,
27810	0	a	it depend if it is depends who who is using it , who is just sitting there clicking clicking clicking clicking , yeah .
27811	0	a	Yeah ,
27812	0	a	some people are
27813	0	a	Yeah .
27814	0	a	If , but I say if if people are getting RSI from it then then then then perhaps we are looking at the wrong market
27815	0	a	n
27816	0	a	Right .
27817	0	a	Yeah ,
27818	0	a	then they are clicking a lot , yeah .
27819	0	a	Yeah .
27820	0	a	W
27821	0	a	like like this this market research thing says number of times per hour that it is used , channel selection a hundred and sixty eight times per hour .
27822	0	a	Yeah .
27823	0	a	Per hour ?
27824	0	a	Wow .
27825	0	a	Yeah .
27826	0	a	That is a lot .
27827	0	a	Yeah .
27828	0	a	Oh ,
27829	0	a	I must admit I had not I would I would missed that .
27830	0	a	That does sound excessive .
27831	0	a	But then again , if you think it of the amount of , you know amount of use it is like
27832	0	a	That is it is less than a second , .
27833	0	a	Yeah .
27834	0	a	Yeah .
27835	0	a	Yeah .
27836	0	a	Yeah .
27837	0	a	Well
27838	0	a	that is right ,
27839	0	a	and
27840	0	a	and I
27841	0	a	I do not
27842	0	a	I do not even know whether the I do not even know whether the s the signal lasts as long as you actually keep the button pressed , or whether it is just a sorta tenth of a second , no matter how long you press it for ,
27843	0	a	I do not know I do not actually know .
27844	0	a	Yeah .
27845	0	a	Though I think with digital TV , like I know on my cable box , you are not supposed to do that because the channel ca not keep up with it if you just press it like that , so you are supposed to use the menu and go through the different channels that way instead of
27846	0	a	Uh oh .
27847	0	a	Yeah .
27848	0	a	Right , so
27849	0	a	I have got a message to say five minutes , I dunno how long ago that appeared .
27850	0	a	cause we are we are getting
27851	0	a	right , so
27852	1	a	I would I need to sum up very quickly here .
27853	0	a	We are looking at extreme simplicity .
27854	0	a	We are looking at a radically different shape .
27855	0	a	Possibly no buttons at all ,
27856	0	a	but if you can incorporate channel change and volume buttons in into the design , then then that is fine .
27857	0	a	in the I mean the the role of the of the the user interface des designer becomes b you know more important here ,
27858	0	a	because , you know , shape is no longer an a a serious constraint .
27859	0	a	But we clearly only need th the main buttons , although , if clearly only need the main functions .
27860	0	a	I do not see why we should not go for voice recognition
27861	0	a	and the the only buttons that I think we need are channel control , volume control and on off .
27862	0	a	it needs to incorporate the corporate logo , the the grey and yellow colour scheme
27863	0	a	and there is no reason why we ca not introduce interchangeable covers .
27864	0	a	d so does that accurately summarise what we have discussed ?
27865	0	a	Right .
27866	0	a	Yeah .
27867	0	a	Yeah .
27868	0	a	Yep .
27869	0	a	Oh
27870	1	a	I just have one question .
27871	0	a	So
27872	0	a	Yeah .
27873	0	a	So
27874	0	a	are we doing just the television
27875	0	a	or are we doing
27876	0	a	so not DVD players ,
27877	0	a	we
27878	0	a	okay
27879	0	a	, okay .
27880	0	a	We are doing just the television .
27881	0	a	No .
27882	0	a	I think that is quite clear from the the information that we have been given ,
27883	0	a	no ?
27884	0	a	Right .
27885	0	a	Okay .
27886	0	a	Yeah ,
27887	0	a	like in the email of television only .
27888	0	a	In fact they are in the constraints email that I got .
27889	0	a	Did not you mention the teletext , just television only ?
27890	0	a	Oh okay .
27891	0	a	Oh yeah
27892	0	a	well
27893	0	a	th that is one I s
27894	0	a	that is one I sent you ,
27895	0	a	which which was my interpretation of of the what came down from from head office .
27896	0	a	Yeah .
27897	0	a	Yeah .
27898	0	a	Oh okay .
27899	0	a	Okay .
27900	0	a	That is that that that that is their their view .
27901	0	a	Okay , so
27902	1	a	we can all give some thought to that for for the next meeting ,
27903	0	a	 
27904	0	a	Alright ?
27905	0	a	Alright .
27906	0	a	Thank you for coming to this third meeting of the design group .
27907	0	a	I think we made some definite progress at the last one and come up with some interesting w suggestions for our our new remote control .
27908	1	a	I will again very quickly just present some notes of that meeting .
27909	0	a	the the the problem with existing remote controls , we felt , was that they are ugly and that people are prepared to pay a premium for something better .
27910	0	a	they have got lots of buttons on them that people do not use and find difficult to learn .
27911	0	a	and people lose them .
27912	0	a	And We we thought that f for our our new remote control that everybody will want to rush out and buy , that we are we should look at speech recognition rather than r rather than buttons , and that if we have any buttons they should be very few of them and only for those functions that are actually identified that that people use .
27913	0	a	That
27914	0	a	we want to go for a long lasting battery that we gua we guarantee for the life of the the product and a shape that will be instantly recognisable , A as a trendy remote control , and and B as a Real Reaction product .
27915	0	a	So that w when people are happy with that , they will they will want to buy everything else from us .
27916	0	a	Okay .
27917	0	a	So
27918	0	a	again , I will we will have the three three presentations from the the the three of you and then we will we will make a a final a final decision .
27919	1	a	and the the decisions that we need to to make today , finally , are what energy source we want to use ,
27920	0	a	whether i it is practical to use a a a long lasting one .
27921	0	a	And I I think our discussion was around the fact that if we are going to go for a long lasting power supply , then basically it is sealed for life and if anybody does manage to run one down , we will we will give them another one .
27922	0	a	And it it will be , you know , prominently displayed as part of the th the advertising literature that it is , you know , for life , guaranteed for life .
27923	1	a	now the the the internal chip and this is where I need Kate is expert advice
27924	0	a	and given that th this has to to go to market as quickly as possible
27925	0	a	d d do we go for a custom designed chip ?
27926	0	a	Or or do we buy one off the shelf and and programme it ourselves ?
27927	0	a	I mean
27928	0	a	I am I am I am n not an expert on these things , but presumably , there must be loads of them already on the market that we can modify .
27929	0	a	But that that is that is your area of expertise .
27930	0	a	And then the , you know , the the overall design of the case is is is
27931	0	a	Kendra is field and we we had some discussions last time as as to how we might go forward
27932	1	a	and we will we will finalise those da today .
27933	0	a	and thi this is all linked in with the the the user interface ,
27934	1	a	whether we p go for voice , buttons , or or a bit of both .
27935	0	a	and then , you know , f for the next meeting Kate will be looking at the the the s the look , feel and design ,
27936	0	a	Kendra the ho
27937	0	a	how the the user actually uses it and and Andrew of course the the product evaluation .
27938	0	a	And Kate and Kendra will be producing a a model for us to to look at .
27939	0	a	so ,
27940	1	a	if if we can have the the three presentations again please , and p perhaps you would like to start k .
27941	0	a	Okay .
27942	1	a	Kate .
27943	0	a	p there we go .
27944	0	a	Oh I am sorry ,
27945	0	a	oh sorry .
27946	0	a	Kay ,
27947	1	a	I will just be talking about the components design .
27948	0	a	And
27949	0	a	Okay ,
27950	0	a	basically I just looked at what exactly do remotes do .
27951	0	a	basically they wait for you to press a key or give a voice command
27952	0	a	and then this is translated into light signals which are then seen by the TV .
27953	0	a	the materials we are going to need to look at the two big ones are the integrated circuit chip and the battery and the in integrated circuit chip works in conjunction with a a diode transistor or resonator , two more resistors and a capacitor and the battery works in conjunction with a resistor and a capacitor .
27954	0	a	basically what happens is you will press a number or give a voice command and this creates a a connection within the the remote
27955	0	a	that allows the chip
27956	0	a	the chip then senses this connection and produces a signal in a Morse code format .
27957	0	a	This signal is sent to the transistor which amplifies it and then sends it on to the light emitting diode
27958	0	a	and
27959	0	a	which is then trai changed into a infrared light which is sent to the TV and sort of seen by the TV and which changes the channels .
27960	0	a	Oh .
27961	0	a	cool .
27962	0	a	so
27963	0	a	as for how we should end up using this in our remote t couple of main questions are the buttons .
27964	0	a	y the fewer buttons you have , I guess the fewer internal connections and internal codes you are going to need .
27965	0	a	however to n not have buttons or to use a voice commands instead of buttons might make these connections more difficult and raise the production cost .
27966	1	a	That is something we should think about .
27967	1	a	Also we have to work within the company constraints ,
27968	0	a	and the company has informed me via email that they are experts at pushbuttons
27969	0	a	and that seems to be the most cost effective way of producing it .
27970	0	a	also with battery connections the company has some limits on the batteries we can use ,
27971	1	a	so I was thinking perhaps a combination of solar cells with a back up basic battery
27972	0	a	and somehow between the combination of that two we might be able to come up with something that will last the the lifetime or the five to ten years and we could still keep that original idea .
27973	1	a	we also need to look at the chips , v custom designed versus off the shelf ,
27974	0	a	and the custom designed will give us much more flexibility
27975	0	a	and enable us to incorporate the voice function that we all seem to have agreed upon .
27976	0	a	, however that is going to cost more , but the off the shelf is going to be cheaper
27977	0	a	and it is going to be allow us to produce it quicker and get out there faster ,
27978	0	a	but it is going to be less flexible with the features , especially things like voice activation ,
27979	0	a	which have not really been used much on remotes , so there is not really chips out there that would be easy to to convert ,
27980	1	a	so if we were definitely going to go with the the voice option we would probably have to design our own chip .
27981	0	a	And that pretty much sums it up .
27982	0	a	Okay ,
27983	0	a	so how
27984	0	a	sorry ,
27985	1	a	can you just put that one back up again , please ? .
27986	0	a	Oh yep ,
27987	0	a	sorry .
27988	0	a	Yep .
27989	0	a	d d d
27990	0	a	okay ,
27991	0	a	I mean
27992	0	a	inevitably a b a custom design chip is going to be more expensive .
27993	0	a	Do we do we know by how much ?
27994	0	a	And and do we know how long it will take to develop a a custom chip .
27995	0	a	I do not actually have any price information , no .
27996	0	a	it
27997	0	a	a lot longer than an off the shelf chip .
27998	0	a	Oh w yeah ,
27999	0	a	we did the
28000	0	a	the problem is the the the voice technology is not really highly developed , it is sort of still still in an ex experimental form ,
28001	0	a	so it would
28002	0	a	it is hard to predict the time .
28003	0	a	Right , okay .
28004	0	a	Right ,
28005	1	a	I think we need to make a a decision here .
28006	0	a	given that the company wants this on the market quickly and cheaply , that would appear to effectively constrain us to an existing chip and thus therefore conventional button technology .
28007	1	a	now before we go round everybody else , does anybody h have any have anyti ha anything to say about that ?
28008	0	a	Cause I must say I find it slightly surprising
28009	0	a	given that , you know , mobile phones incorporate voice activated dialling .
28010	0	a	I
28011	1	a	I just have a question about that .
28012	0	a	does it make a difference if there are just a few commands ,
28013	1	a	for example if you can pre programme in like numbers one through ten and pre programme say , you know , nine channels
28014	1	a	and then just use the voice recognition to say channel one
28015	0	a	and then you have programmed in say BBC four as your channel one , as your favourite , it is like to have a certain number of favourites
28016	0	a	and that w
28017	0	a	Okay .
28018	0	a	W
28019	0	a	just to to incorporate the voice activation in it is is sorta the trick .
28020	0	a	Once you have got the whole voice chip in there , then it is pretty much the the world the the sky is your limit ,
28021	0	a	but to actually the
28022	0	a	the big step is to actually get the voice activation chips in there and working .
28023	0	a	Then it does not matter .
28024	0	a	Okay .
28025	0	a	Okay .
28026	0	a	So I mean
28027	0	a	I d d
28028	0	a	for slightly different
28029	0	a	well no ,
28030	0	a	I mean ,
28031	0	a	it is
28032	0	a	if you you speak somebody is name and it will dial the number for you ,
28033	0	a	so bu I mean
28034	0	a	the this this information is from is
28035	0	a	this is the internal company information , is it ?
28036	0	a	So
28037	0	a	Yeah , true , again
28038	0	a	but if it is without any without any p price informations that is difficult to decide .
28039	0	a	Yeah .
28040	0	a	bits of it ,
28041	0	a	yeah .
28042	0	a	Of course mobile phones do tend to be more expensive ,
28043	0	a	you know ,
28044	0	a	hundred and fifty pounds or something .
28045	0	a	Yes , as well .
28046	0	a	As opposed to the twenty Euros , twenty five Euros .
28047	0	a	Yeah .
28048	0	a	Also lots of mobile phones have got a lot of technology in them , not just that , so .
28049	0	a	Yeah , that is that is right .
28050	0	a	It is like it is it is
28051	0	a	you ca not
28052	0	a	cause mobile phones are expensive , you ca not say it is the voice recognition bit that is .
28053	0	a	Yeah .
28054	0	a	But we do not know .
28055	0	a	I mean
28056	0	a	I su i
28057	0	a	I mean
28058	0	a	if
28059	0	a	given that the the technology is not well developed and and given that it is it is never been done before ,
28060	0	a	th th the double risk ,
28061	1	a	perhaps we ought to stick to to buttons ,
28062	0	a	since the last thing we want to do is present a product that does not work .
28063	0	a	Thoughts ?
28064	0	a	I mean do w
28065	0	a	do we think that the voice technology is fundamental to the project ?
28066	0	a	I mean I think we
28067	0	a	Well ,
28068	0	a	another thought
28069	0	a	I
28070	0	a	oh ,
28071	0	a	sorry ,
28072	1	a	go ahead .
28073	0	a	Would
28074	0	a	Oh
28075	0	a	I was just going to say mayb maybe
28076	0	a	it sh like
28077	1	a	maybe we can like cut corners somewhere else to bring in over cost .
28078	0	a	it is fundament
28079	0	a	well I mean
28080	0	a	I guess it it is something we have discussed since the the sort of the beginning ,
28081	0	a	so I th I think in in our in our minds it is it is fundamental ,
28082	0	a	but I do not know that the the upper echelons of the company would necessarily agree with that ,
28083	0	a	so I think you have to
28084	0	a	Hm .
28085	0	a	Oh yeah .
28086	0	a	Okay .
28087	0	a	Well ,
28088	1	a	I kind of think if we are going to have the voice recognition for part of it , then maybe we should have it for the whole thing .
28089	0	a	Yeah ,
28090	0	a	I I
28091	0	a	I
28092	0	a	I
28093	0	a	I think that is
28094	0	a	Yeah ,
28095	0	a	yeah .
28096	0	a	And we have been talking about it the whole time .
28097	1	a	Anyway , I am I am incli kind of inclined to say that we should just go for it .
28098	0	a	, right , okay .
28099	0	a	yeah ,
28100	0	a	it is the second most important aspect to users that the device should be technologically innovative .
28101	0	a	Yeah .
28102	0	a	From my presentation show , so .
28103	0	a	Yeah , it should be Right , okay ,
28104	0	a	so .
28105	0	a	technologically innovative .
28106	0	a	No ,
28107	0	a	that sounds good .
28108	0	a	Fine .
28109	0	a	Okay .
28110	0	a	I
28111	0	a	it will have voice recognition
28112	0	a	if if that means if that means we ca not afford buttons
28113	0	a	but I mean b b
28114	0	a	second question ,
28115	0	a	do we need the five buttons for channel change , up down , volume up down and on off , just as a a backup or just so that people can j j just sit there pressing buttons ?
28116	0	a	Right .
28117	0	a	Okay .
28118	0	a	Cool .
28119	0	a	Yeah , I I would say we do , yeah .
28120	0	a	Yeah .
28121	0	a	I think so .
28122	0	a	Okay .
28123	0	a	Sorry ,
28124	0	a	d did you want to say anything ?
28125	0	a	No ?
28126	0	a	Okay .
28127	0	a	nope , that was it , that was it .
28128	1	a	Shall we move rapidly on to Kendra ?
28129	1	a	ra rapidly move the cable over .
28130	0	a	Okay .
28131	0	a	Okay .
28132	0	a	Let is see .
28133	0	a	Oh good .
28134	0	a	Oh .
28135	0	a	Yes .
28136	0	a	Is it going to work ?
28137	0	a	Okay .
28138	0	a	Yeah ,
28139	0	a	it is thinking about it .
28140	0	a	yeah , it will get there .
28141	0	a	Yep .
28142	0	a	Yeah .
28143	0	a	Okay ,
28144	0	a	so I did some research on the internet
28145	0	a	and
28146	0	a	what
28147	0	a	you know ,
28148	0	a	the interf user interface are just aspects that are seen by users , commands and mechanisms for the operation , and there are just kind of a variety of choices .
28149	0	a	findings ,
28150	0	a	so
28151	0	a	a lot of times they tend to look cluttered and these were just a couple examples of different kinds that are a little bit more unusual .
28152	0	a	There are some special ones available , like this one right here , which is marketed towards children , different designs , and one of the things that n we need to watch out for is a V in volume
28153	0	a	because people some
28154	0	a	Bring a little picture of what I thought ours could look like .
28155	0	a	, yeah .
28156	0	a	Uh huh .
28157	0	a	Alright .
28158	0	a	So
28159	1	a	just kind of minimise the clutter , avoid too many buttons
28160	0	a	and also one of the things that people have used is a slide button , like you have on a mouse ,
28161	1	a	that possibly we could use that on the sides for volume , for example , have the slide button on the side , and then you can pre programme the channels , the voice recognition and then the voice response sample locator .
28162	0	a	yeah .
28163	0	a	Sorry
28164	0	a	y y
28165	0	a	yeah ,
28166	1	a	if I can interrupt you .
28167	0	a	Well
28168	0	a	d p
28169	0	a	kay ,
28170	0	a	do you want to say anything about slide controls ?
28171	0	a	I mean I think the reason everybody uses pushbuttons is that they are they are si simple , cheap and reliable .
28172	0	a	I think they are they are about the same cost really .
28173	0	a	I I mean ,
28174	0	a	I think it is just sort of the the
28175	0	a	there is a lot of slide buttons out there .
28176	0	a	I think it is pretty much the same sort of connection .
28177	0	a	Okay , fair enough , fine .
28178	0	a	yeah .
28179	0	a	Just because I n
28180	0	a	for example if I am using a mouse I like to be able to slide it up and down
28181	0	a	so I thought it might be good for volume to just be able to kind of roll it and then have the up and down
28182	0	a	and then the
28183	0	a	this is my great little drawing .
28184	0	a	Yeah .
28185	0	a	Good , good .
28186	0	a	Yeah .
28187	0	a	So three three there is three buttons on a slider .
28188	0	a	Three buttons , channel up channel up down and
28189	0	a	Uh huh .
28190	0	a	Y yes , yes .
28191	0	a	Well ,
28192	1	a	if you g if you if you got a channel up down , we can have a slider in that as well .
28193	0	a	Because if it if you no
28194	0	a	if you notice on the thing it it kind of like has got kind of if you
28195	0	a	you know it s kind of like sticks ,
28196	0	a	if you know what I mean ,
28197	0	a	up like one unit ,
28198	0	a	if you see what I mean .
28199	0	a	Yeah .
28200	0	a	So it kind of goes up one , then y like you can keep rolling it up , but it is like like like like a cog or something .
28201	0	a	So you kind of take it up one at a time .
28202	0	a	Okay .
28203	1	a	The only advantage I was thinking of to having the buttons , like the buttons on one side for the channel , and then the slider is that if you are just holding in your hand , and you pick it up , it is easy to
28204	1	a	n s know
28205	1	a	, okay , this is just the volume and this is the channel .
28206	0	a	D
28207	0	a	Oh .
28208	0	a	This one on the one side and one
28209	0	a	yeah .
28210	0	a	you could you could as l as like a mouse you could
28211	0	a	Yeah ,
28212	0	a	like the shape of it almost like a mouse ,
28213	0	a	with a Dep I dunno
28214	0	a	if it
28215	0	a	depending on the final shape of it ,
28216	0	a	cause you could have like , I dunno , it looks like you can c control the volume with your thumb , and then you could control the buttons with your fingers .
28217	0	a	yeah ,
28218	0	a	cause I have definitely picked up remotes and like meant to change the channel and turn the volume , or vice versa ,
28219	0	a	so it would be kind of good to have them be feel completely different .
28220	0	a	Okay .
28221	0	a	Yeah .
28222	0	a	Yeah .
28223	0	a	Yeah .
28224	0	a	You would know what you were fiddling with .
28225	0	a	Yeah .
28226	0	a	Yeah ,
28227	0	a	or yeah th th
28228	0	a	the I mean thi
28229	0	a	this is what the
28230	1	a	we have to come up with is the the actual shape
28231	0	a	that people can ins instantly pick it up and and know know know what it is going to do .
28232	0	a	That was
28233	0	a	Yeah .
28234	0	a	Okay ,
28235	1	a	so we we are looking at sliders for both a volume and channel change of one sort .
28236	0	a	well
28237	0	a	I was thinking kind of just for the volume ,
28238	0	a	but what what do you guys think ?
28239	0	a	We could
28240	0	a	Yeah ,
28241	0	a	yeah .
28242	0	a	Just for the volume , .
28243	0	a	Yeah ,
28244	0	a	cause if
28245	0	a	yeah ,
28246	0	a	in that kind of position the fingers would be better for pressing and the that for rolling ,
28247	0	a	just the way it would
28248	0	a	yeah ,
28249	0	a	yeah ,
28250	0	a	yeah .
28251	0	a	Fingers ,
28252	0	a	yeah .
28253	0	a	It
28254	0	a	yeah ,
28255	0	a	I mean
28256	0	a	it it
28257	0	a	it seems to me that it it al also has the advantage that it it the two are clearly different , that there is no no possibility of confusing the two .
28258	0	a	B
28259	0	a	Yeah .
28260	0	a	Yeah .
28261	0	a	Oh yeah ,
28262	0	a	yeah .
28263	0	a	So okay .
28264	1	a	I am just going to pass this along .
28265	0	a	Right so
28266	0	a	that is
28267	0	a	sorry
28268	0	a	is that that all you want to say at the mo
28269	0	a	okay , fine .
28270	0	a	Yes .
28271	0	a	Yeah .
28272	0	a	right .
28273	1	a	Here we go .
28274	0	a	Right .
28275	0	a	yeah ,
28276	0	a	this is my report on trend watching .
28277	0	a	The data is come off internet from executive summary for us on the top three things wanted by the consumer .
28278	0	a	And we got reports from Paris , Milan on new fashions .
28279	0	a	And the most important aspect is the l the look
28280	1	a	it has to look fancy , look and feel instead of the current functional look and feel .
28281	0	a	This is a st
28282	0	a	well
28283	0	a	I was going to say yeah twice as important as the second aspect , which is the technologically innov innovative side of it .
28284	0	a	So
28285	0	a	and the third being easy to use is probably a given ,
28286	1	a	we have to try and incorporate ,
28287	0	a	so
28288	0	a	exactly , yeah .
28289	0	a	Well I I mean
28290	0	a	I th
28291	1	a	I think that what we are suggesting ought to address all three of those .
28292	0	a	Yeah .
28293	0	a	Okay .
28294	0	a	I s that out of sequence ?
28295	0	a	yeah ,
28296	0	a	sorry .
28297	0	a	yeah , and
28298	0	a	from the fashion watchers from Milan and Paris have said fruit and vegetables are an important theme for clothes and furniture and shoes , et cetera .
28299	0	a	Oh .
28300	0	a	sorry ,
28301	0	a	clothes , shoes and furniture
28302	1	a	and a spongy material to be used on the on the outside .
28303	0	a	Uh huh .
28304	0	a	I had not thought of that ,
28305	0	a	that is different , certainly .
28306	0	a	Yeah .
28307	1	a	But I was going to say
28308	0	a	yeah ,
28309	0	a	fruit and vegetables , important to this year important to furniture ,
28310	1	a	I am just going to say
28311	0	a	f like it is in if if fashion
28312	1	a	if we are going for the it looks fancy , then fashion is obviously the line we gotta be going through .
28313	0	a	What ?
28314	0	a	Yeah .
28315	0	a	But fashions do do not last very long .
28316	0	a	Well
28317	0	a	that can kind of tie into our changing face things ,
28318	1	a	like we could have the fruit and vegetable theme this year and whatever happens next year , we can have the face plates ,
28319	0	a	yeah .
28320	0	a	Yeah .
28321	0	a	Yeah .
28322	0	a	Yeah ,
28323	1	a	we can have a sp like a spongy skin on it
28324	1	a	and then we can just whip that off and
28325	0	a	A kind of
28326	0	a	yeah .
28327	0	a	Yeah ,
28328	0	a	yeah .
28329	0	a	Yeah
28330	1	a	like the kind you get on like hand weights .
28331	1	a	You know , that kind of spongy
28332	0	a	yeah .
28333	0	a	, yeah ,
28334	0	a	that weird I dunno what that is ,
28335	0	a	but yeah .
28336	0	a	Also means you can drop it without damaging it .
28337	0	a	Oh
28338	0	a	Yeah .
28339	0	a	, yeah , it is good as well .
28340	0	a	That is c cool .
28341	0	a	Yeah , that is true .
28342	0	a	you have we could if we could save
28343	0	a	depending on the cost of the product itself , you know , could we have a cheaper b cheaper power source and then just have it annually renewed ?
28344	0	a	Instead of having a ten year guarantee ?
28345	1	a	With interchangeable covers , could just buy a new one every year , a new one when new fashions come out .
28346	0	a	Yeah .
28347	0	a	I
28348	0	a	I mean it
28349	0	a	its I that is an interesting idea ,
28350	0	a	it is like the old Swatch watch where on only batteries ever got changed in those , cause people just bought a new one when it went out of fashion , but it is just never been seen as a a fashion item before .
28351	0	a	Yeah .
28352	0	a	that is
28353	0	a	yes if if if they are made in sufficient quantity
28354	0	a	W
28355	0	a	I mean
28356	0	a	we we can b
28357	0	a	but
28358	0	a	I mean my feeling is that current power sources are such that for relatively little cost
28359	0	a	you can make it last , you know , a long time .
28360	0	a	Wh
28361	0	a	What if we included the batteries in the cover ?
28362	0	a	So
28363	0	a	like
28364	0	a	Yeah , so
28365	1	a	can I see that thing ?
28366	0	a	Just this as examples .
28367	0	a	I I think it is easier sometimes to have them buy changeable covers for it than to buy a whole new one ,
28368	0	a	because you do not feel like you are investing in a whole new product .
28369	0	a	Yeah .
28370	0	a	Yeah .
28371	0	a	but if we also make it cheap enough that people either change the cover every year or even buy a new one every year
28372	0	a	then it it is it is even better .
28373	0	a	Oh yeah .
28374	0	a	I like that .
28375	0	a	That all c also kind of encourages them to buy new covers
28376	0	a	and
28377	0	a	yeah .
28378	0	a	S
28379	0	a	Yeah , yeah ,
28380	0	a	I n I know the only p
28381	0	a	I mean the the the the immediate thing that comes to mind with that is that it
28382	0	a	it
28383	0	a	it
28384	0	a	y you have then got the connection
28385	0	a	and you have immediately got a sort of unreliability ,
28386	0	a	whereas the advantage of having it plumbed in is that that the whole thing is all , you know , completely soldered together
28387	0	a	and it it it you know , total reliability ,
28388	0	a	but I mean I d I
28389	0	a	I
28390	0	a	I know what you are saying and understand where you are coming from .
28391	0	a	So f
28392	0	a	Yeah , I guess that is true .
28393	0	a	yeah .
28394	0	a	Or well ,
28395	0	a	but like like more than just the battery , like a complete different like you have only got
28396	0	a	like , you know like th
28397	1	a	this bit is the bit you keep ,
28398	0	a	and this is the expensive bit , this is like the chip and this is the microphone .
28399	1	a	And then this is the power source and the bit everyone sees .
28400	0	a	And then
28401	0	a	Yeah , you probably are right .
28402	0	a	I th
28403	0	a	I s
28404	0	a	I think if we are going to go down that route , then we are talking about even if it costs slightly more than that , just building the whole thing in one ,
28405	0	a	then having getting cheaper production costs and , you know giving people the option of buying a new a a complete new thing ,
28406	0	a	the advantage of a replaceable cover is that even if they do not it does not have a cover on at all , it will still work totally .
28407	0	a	Yeah , that is true .
28408	0	a	then if , you know , if people lose the cover , I mean they they might be well inclined to go out and spend however many Euros on a on a new one rather than a a complete new re remote .
28409	0	a	Yeah ,
28410	0	a	yeah .
28411	0	a	Yeah .
28412	0	a	Well
28413	0	a	that that is just it with the covers , you are sort of tricking them into continuing to spend their money on our products without making them feel like they are being ripped off having to buy a new product .
28414	0	a	Yeah .
28415	0	a	Yeah ,
28416	0	a	I mean it is it is up to it is up to
28417	0	a	Yeah ,
28418	1	a	it is it is up to our marketing people to to ma to ma turn it into a a fashion item .
28419	0	a	Yeah ,
28420	0	a	just another five Euro to get
28421	0	a	Right .
28422	0	a	So ,
28423	0	a	yeah .
28424	0	a	Yeah .
28425	0	a	, yeah .
28426	1	a	and , you know , as as external fashions change , then we get new new covers on the market and , you know , readily available .
28427	0	a	Yeah .
28428	0	a	And
28429	0	a	that is that is right , yeah ,
28430	0	a	yeah .
28431	0	a	And that is the sort of thing , once you get the mould set , you can just whip out different colours , different pictures very very quickly .
28432	0	a	Yeah ,
28433	0	a	like they have for mobile phones that are just fruits and animal prints and colours .
28434	0	a	Yeah , yeah , exactly , exactly .
28435	0	a	Yeah .
28436	0	a	Yeah , okay .
28437	0	a	So i
28438	0	a	so okay .
28439	0	a	right ,
28440	0	a	sorry .
28441	0	a	we had not finished your It is the sort of thing that we want people to have prominent dis displayed on their coffee table to say this says something about me .
28442	0	a	oh , do not worry
28443	0	a	it is all said ,
28444	1	a	I was just going to say
28445	0	a	yeah ,
28446	0	a	are we going to make this as part of like like a part of the f like it it
28447	0	a	the fashions apply to furniture ,
28448	0	a	so are we going to make this part of the furniture ?
28449	0	a	Yeah .
28450	0	a	this is fashionable .
28451	0	a	This is fashionable
28452	0	a	with
28453	0	a	Oh yeah .
28454	0	a	Yeah .
28455	0	a	I , you know , I am I am
28456	0	a	I am with it , I am up to date .
28457	0	a	And you know , th the the design that I have got , and
28458	0	a	and it could be a a home made design , you know this says this is not just a a television remote control
28459	0	a	, this is , you know , a fashion accessory .
28460	0	a	so I mean
28461	0	a	the the the basic shape i is is what we
28462	0	a	I mean given that we have got you know one one on off button presumably , two buttons for channel change and
28463	0	a	one slider and basically nothing else ,
28464	1	a	w we need to decide on the just the basic shape of the thing .
28465	0	a	And , know whether we go down the fruit and veg route ,
28466	1	a	and I do not suggest we make it look like a banana , but know sort of the the organic , you know , curved look ,
28467	0	a	you know ,
28468	0	a	t to deliberately get away from the you know , the the the the square look of most current remotes
28469	0	a	and , you know , whether whether the you know , the the fixed part of it is the corporate yellow .
28470	0	a	or
28471	0	a	cause there is certainly you know , the the corporate logo needs to be prominently displayed so that people s th looked at it and say right , that is a Real Reaction remote control
28472	0	a	, I want one of those .
28473	0	a	I dunno that we should make the whole thing yellow
28474	1	a	I kind of thought with a you would have like a yellow circle with the RR in it somewhere on it ,
28475	0	a	but I would
28476	0	a	yellow seems a bit of a strong colour
28477	0	a	to make the ent like the thing
28478	0	a	no ,
28479	0	a	but I mean just like white or grey or black or some sort of colour .
28480	0	a	Yeah
28481	0	a	the the or or b
28482	0	a	Yeah ,
28483	0	a	I would I would
28484	0	a	yeah .
28485	0	a	Yeah ,
28486	0	a	like an .
28487	0	a	Yeah .
28488	0	a	no
28489	0	a	I d
28490	0	a	I
28491	0	a	I agree ,
28492	0	a	I mean we are
28493	0	a	we are
28494	0	a	we are simply it is simply required to incorporate the the the the corporate logo prominently .
28495	0	a	Yeah ,
28496	0	a	yeah .
28497	0	a	Yeah .
28498	0	a	Yeah .
28499	0	a	And make that a fashion symbol as well .
28500	0	a	Well
28501	0	a	n
28502	0	a	Well
28503	1	a	I was sort of kind of picturing like maybe a shape that is almost like a mouse .
28504	0	a	Well ,
28505	0	a	th this is this is the whole point ,
28506	0	a	yes ,
28507	0	a	you know ,
28508	0	a	I am
28509	0	a	I have got a a Real Reaction remote control to go with my Real Reaction coffee maker or or whatever .
28510	0	a	And then people , you know , people demand more Real Reaction stuff .
28511	0	a	Yeah .
28512	0	a	So that , you know , when they hold it it is
28513	0	a	because a mouse is pretty comfortable to hold in your hand
28514	1	a	maybe we could make it a slightly different shape
28515	0	a	so they could hold on to it ,
28516	1	a	but that way they can have the volume on the side and then the channel buttons and have the power , wherever , somewhere .
28517	0	a	Yeah .
28518	0	a	Yeah .
28519	0	a	Yeah .
28520	0	a	Yeah .
28521	0	a	I mean that was just an idea that I had .
28522	0	a	I mean I have
28523	0	a	yeah .
28524	0	a	Oh no
28525	0	a	that
28526	0	a	well
28527	0	a	there is the sim my
28528	1	a	my idea was something
28529	1	a	a b probably you know a bit fatter than this
28530	1	a	but sort of tha that sorta shape
28531	0	a	so that you can just sort of ho hold it .
28532	0	a	Yeah .
28533	0	a	Yeah , maybe .
28534	0	a	Yeah ,
28535	1	a	you would want it narrower than a mouse though
28536	0	a	cause it a mouse you are kind of just resting on it ,
28537	1	a	you want something you can definitely grip .
28538	0	a	Kind of a c
28539	0	a	Yeah .
28540	0	a	W it
28541	0	a	I mean well
28542	1	a	it is sort of it is it is sort of a a mouse ,
28543	0	a	but held , you know ,
28544	0	a	so it is you sorta hold it in your hand like that
28545	0	a	, i with , you know , and fiddling with the buttons .
28546	0	a	So maybe it would be
28547	0	a	Yeah ,
28548	0	a	yeah .
28549	1	a	Sort of a combination .
28550	0	a	Yeah .
28551	0	a	Yeah .
28552	0	a	Yeah ,
28553	0	a	and fiddle around with it and press it .
28554	0	a	Yeah
28555	0	a	so yeah ,
28556	1	a	kind of maybe maybe a little wider than this ,
28557	0	a	cause this is pretty comfortable to hold ,
28558	0	a	and then if you had
28559	0	a	Yeah ,
28560	1	a	then wider up here .
28561	1	a	Maybe almost like a hairbrush , like you could get the about the width of that end of the pen and then it widens up top
28562	0	a	and you can fiddle
28563	0	a	an
28564	0	a	yeah .
28565	1	a	And then it would have a l wider thing to have the light , the infrared light at the TV and just kind of change channels and adjust the volume and the power could be wherever , up up the top or something .
28566	0	a	Yeah ,
28567	0	a	yeah .
28568	0	a	Yeah .
28569	0	a	Yeah , cool .
28570	0	a	What do you guys think about that ?
28571	0	a	Oh yeah .
28572	0	a	Yeah ,
28573	0	a	that sounds
28574	0	a	I am just I am suddenly realising that yeah we are discussing how much how good it is going to be to change channels
28575	0	a	t
28576	0	a	we still can just tell it to .
28577	0	a	Okay ,
28578	0	a	yeah ,
28579	0	a	yeah .
28580	0	a	I mean are we are we starting to get away from the the voice functionality of it ?
28581	0	a	Yeah ,
28582	0	a	maybe we cou
28583	0	a	like
28584	0	a	w
28585	0	a	like
28586	0	a	we are leaving out the buttons for the the f less frequently used stuff ,
28587	1	a	but maybe we could incorporate that into the voice .
28588	0	a	Yeah .
28589	0	a	It is a very good point .
28590	0	a	It is a very good point .
28591	0	a	Yeah .
28592	0	a	I think we d I think we decided that w we are actually going down both routes .
28593	0	a	Yeah ,
28594	0	a	yeah .
28595	0	a	Yeah .
28596	0	a	That the we n
28597	0	a	we need the the manual controls and that they should be of that form ,
28598	0	a	but that
28599	0	a	yeah .
28600	0	a	Yeah .
28601	0	a	But do you know , this shape also kind of les lend itself to to voice
28602	0	a	cause if you are you are holding it and you are fiddling , but you can also bring it up like that
28603	0	a	and it is microphone esque ,
28604	0	a	yeah ,
28605	0	a	yeah .
28606	0	a	Then you just bring it up to your mouth and just speak to it ,
28607	0	a	yeah ,
28608	0	a	yeah .
28609	0	a	Yeah ,
28610	0	a	and just say
28611	0	a	Yeah ,
28612	0	a	I suppose I sup
28613	1	a	So I guess we could have a menu button as well .
28614	0	a	I th I th honest
28615	0	a	my personal view is that if it is not there , people would not use it anyway .
28616	0	a	I suppose ,
28617	0	a	but t there is the off chance that , you know , th the brightness is wrong on your TV or the contrast needs changing .
28618	0	a	It is cer it is certainly possible I mean ,
28619	0	a	but they we we are going beyond w w
28620	0	a	given the state of the technology we want something that we kno we know will will work .
28621	0	a	Bu
28622	0	a	yeah .
28623	0	a	Well
28624	1	a	you can still i incorporate the voice with with less buttons .
28625	0	a	I mean
28626	1	a	if the power button was also somehow like a menu button you could press that and or do voice commands , and either volume thing could also be to scroll through other options like y and you could scroll through brightness
28627	0	a	and and sc
28628	1	a	and then you can you can minimise the buttons and still have those , you know , brightness and tint and stuff .
28629	0	a	Yeah .
28630	0	a	Yeah , that is a good idea .
28631	0	a	Yeah .
28632	0	a	If we we are
28633	0	a	I mean
28634	0	a	I am getting a clear message that we think that we should have those facilities available .
28635	0	a	Yeah
28636	0	a	Yeah .
28637	1	a	We could have the channels and the power and then a menu button and then the volume .
28638	1	a	So have four buttons and the volume instead of three buttons and the volume .
28639	0	a	Okay ,
28640	0	a	if we if we are going down that route , then we need some sort of display .
28641	0	a	Do we need some sort of display ?
28642	0	a	We actually use the television , okay .
28643	0	a	But the television would be the display
28644	0	a	that
28645	0	a	things like that usually c pop up on a televi like you hit menu and menu will come up on television and have like tint brightness , and you would use the scroll , scroll through it
28646	0	a	yeah .
28647	0	a	Yeah , that is on the TV , yeah .
28648	0	a	Yeah ,
28649	0	a	and then y
28650	0	a	Yeah , press that
28651	0	a	is t
28652	0	a	yeah , that might work .
28653	0	a	Okay , okay , okay .
28654	0	a	Well I mean
28655	0	a	on a
28656	0	a	onto like a mouse , the ru the scrolling button , is actually a button as well ,
28657	1	a	you could press it , you could press that and have it as a menu button .
28658	0	a	Yep .
28659	0	a	Yeah ,
28660	0	a	yeah , that is true .
28661	0	a	I never understood how that worked though ,
28662	0	a	but yeah .
28663	0	a	Yeah ,
28664	0	a	it is like
28665	0	a	yeah ,
28666	0	a	it is like the mouse where you just kind of click it .
28667	0	a	Yeah , .
28668	0	a	You just press it .
28669	0	a	Yeah ,
28670	0	a	and you could just click that to
28671	1	a	so if you had like the menu then you could scroll through and then click it to select .
28672	0	a	, oka
28673	0	a	yeah .
28674	0	a	Yeah .
28675	0	a	yeah .
28676	0	a	You know what I mean ?
28677	0	a	Okay .
28678	0	a	yeah .
28679	0	a	Okay ,
28680	0	a	we got five minutes to go in this meeting ,
28681	0	a	so
28682	0	a	I d
28683	1	a	I think we have actually very conveniently just come to a good point to s to sum up .
28684	0	a	Cool .
28685	0	a	So
28686	0	a	b b
28687	0	a	Kate and Kendra now go away and pa play play with a bit of Plasticine or play dough , whatever it is on the other side of the Atlantic .
28688	0	a	Play with play dough .
28689	1	a	and actually put what we have discussed into something I was going to say concrete ,
28690	0	a	but that is a slightly inappropriate word
28691	1	a	to something that we can we can see and Andrew n can go away and th th think about how we can actually market this as a concept and not j not just a a a simple remote control .
28692	1	a	can I just get some things clear just for my sake .
28693	0	a	Yeah , certainly , of course .
28694	0	a	Our energy source is going to be long term .
28695	0	a	I think I think we decided that we are going to for
28696	0	a	for simplicity of , you know , manufacturing and maintenance that we will go for a a long term battery source ,
28697	0	a	I
28698	0	a	you know ,
28699	0	a	on the basis that that ,
28700	0	a	you know ,
28701	0	a	if we are going for making it a fashion statement , then people are more likely to change it anyway before i it runs out and make an assumption that we we can aim for a battery that will last most people for we will say at least five five ten years and that we will w we will guarantee it for for five years .
28702	0	a	Cool .
28703	0	a	And we are having a custom chip ?
28704	0	a	And interchangeable case ?
28705	0	a	Yeah .
28706	0	a	We are having a a custom chip , but given the the we have cut the functions down ,
28707	0	a	that will hopefully not be too problematic ,
28708	0	a	but given that technol technological innovation is important , then we need to ,
28709	0	a	I will say it again , technologically innovate .
28710	0	a	and
28711	1	a	we we , know , we must resist any efforts to to try and water that down .
28712	0	a	I i interchangeable case seems to be important to the concept .
28713	0	a	it it should be cheap , you know , if if we avoid any , you know , electrical connections .
28714	0	a	Yeah .
28715	0	a	And i you know ,
28716	0	a	i if we can come up with some way of of allowing people to actually personalise it to whatever they want , then I mean this is totally new .
28717	0	a	We d we do not know whether that to what extent people do it or not ,
28718	1	a	but if they have at least got a a good selection of covers that they can use anyway , and and if if we can keep them , you know , rolling ,
28719	0	a	then
28720	0	a	you know ,
28721	1	a	so they can get them in the supermarket when they go down to a any of the famous supermarkets ,
28722	1	a	I wo not mention any mention any names ,
28723	0	a	it is it is good for the supermarket and it is good for us and it hopefully makes them feel better .
28724	0	a	And are we going to have it il being illuminated from inside onto the buttons or
28725	0	a	Cool .
28726	0	a	the that I mean that is
28727	0	a	no ,
28728	0	a	because we have got so few buttons that it that actually makes that redundant .
28729	0	a	Yeah , I think so too .
28730	0	a	, does actually , yeah ,
28731	0	a	yeah .
28732	0	a	Yeah ,
28733	0	a	and especially for making them so like different and
28734	0	a	Yeah .
28735	0	a	different to feel ,
28736	0	a	yeah ,
28737	0	a	yeah .
28738	0	a	Yeah ,
28739	0	a	yeah .
28740	0	a	And the
28741	0	a	you know ,
28742	0	a	that that solves one of the problems of b of battery life ,
28743	0	a	cause that would well that would clobber the battery life , so no , I mean given the nature of the buttons we are having , it is actually unnecessary I think .
28744	0	a	Yeah .
28745	0	a	Yep
28746	0	a	, yeah .
28747	0	a	Yeah .
28748	0	a	Yeah .
28749	1	a	Are we having it that it is any angle , or is it just
28750	1	a	As wide as possible .
28751	1	a	As as wide cer certainly wider angle than than current ,
28752	0	a	so that if you are holding it , you know , anyway like you are likely to and it is you know
28753	0	a	, i i it will work most of the time .
28754	0	a	Yeah .
28755	0	a	Like this or like this .
28756	0	a	yeah .
28757	0	a	Not like my my mum who points it at the ceiling and wonders why the th th the television does not work .
28758	0	a	yeah ,
28759	0	a	I mean
28760	0	a	I d I th
28761	1	a	I sorta envisaged that if if this was the the thing , then sort of the the whole of the top would be the the infrared .
28762	0	a	Yeah ,
28763	0	a	kind of like this whole
28764	1	a	So you could use like this and it would go .
28765	0	a	Yeah , .
28766	0	a	so Yeah ,
28767	0	a	cause I mean the r reality is people are they are going to be looking at the television whilst they are using it , the chances are , so if if they are holding it anyway , the they are reasonably likely to be holding it to use it , then
28768	0	a	then that that is the sort of coverage that we want .
28769	0	a	Yeah .
28770	0	a	Yeah .
28771	0	a	okay ,
28772	0	a	d
28773	0	a	we are all clear where we go from here .
28774	0	a	Yep ,
28775	0	a	sounds good .
28776	0	a	Yep .
28777	0	a	Okay , so
28778	0	a	thank you very much indeed
28779	0	a	Kay .
28780	0	a	 
28781	0	a	Right well .
28782	0	a	Welcome to the what should be the last of these meetings
28783	0	a	and it looks like we have done a good job here
28784	1	a	and we will just go through the the final the final details .
28785	0	a	okay ,
28786	0	a	oh
28787	1	a	the th the the minutes of the last meeting I think we will take those as read ,
28788	0	a	Okay
28789	0	a	the th the the next thing
28790	0	a	we
28791	0	a	we we will have a look at the th
28792	0	a	have a look at the prototypes and look at the evaluation criteria and finance and then just tidy up with production
28793	0	a	and and then we can close .
28794	1	a	So f if if you would like to present your your proposals .
28795	0	a	okay
28796	0	a	we basically have the same kind of lay out here
28797	0	a	it is just
28798	0	a	you hold it like this
28799	0	a	and it gets kind of moulded to the to the shape of your hand , basically .
28800	0	a	on the left we have got the scroll for the volume , on the right we have buttons for the channels up and down and that kind of
28801	0	a	so you can hold it and scroll , or you can hold it and and push .
28802	0	a	this is the power key , it is kind of like the biggest
28803	0	a	so you know how to turn on .
28804	0	a	Uh huh .
28805	0	a	that is the little menu key .
28806	0	a	This is the infra red section
28807	0	a	so you g
28808	0	a	it will be sending rays and if you are you know pointing it like that it can send it , or if you hold it up like that it will send it .
28809	0	a	Yep , yeah , good , good .
28810	0	a	we got a microphone there which for all the voice commands so you can you know talk to it like that
28811	0	a	and it will still understand .
28812	0	a	Uh huh .
28813	0	a	Yep , right .
28814	0	a	the logo is down down there and has the cover on it
28815	0	a	and you can see like it just kind of goes
28816	0	a	the red bit is the cover and it kind of goes over everything
28817	0	a	and then there is holes for the buttons to come through .
28818	0	a	Uh huh .
28819	0	a	S
28820	1	a	And so we figured it would be kind of you know a light weight plastic , just kind of a light non descript grey
28821	0	a	so that people will want to buy the covers
28822	1	a	and then the covers will be that sort of rubbery material like they make iPod covers ,
28823	0	a	so they kind of just stretch over .
28824	0	a	Yep , yep , .
28825	0	a	Uh huh .
28826	0	a	Yep yep .
28827	0	a	Yep .
28828	0	a	showing me age ,
28829	0	a	I do not know what i c iPod covers are like .
28830	0	a	Yeah , well
28831	0	a	I I did not know that
28832	0	a	but yeah they are kind of
28833	0	a	it is just kind of a rubbery
28834	0	a	and that way
28835	0	a	you know
28836	0	a	spongy like is something that people wanted and it just sort of stretches over and that way
28837	0	a	I think probably helps protect it a little bit too as well
28838	0	a	and
28839	1	a	just kind of stretch it over and it will just stay on and then the buttons come through
28840	0	a	and so and then the
28841	1	a	each one of them on the very end will have the logo with the yellow circle and the RR .
28842	0	a	Yeah yeah .
28843	0	a	Uh huh .
28844	0	a	Yeah .
28845	0	a	Okay ,
28846	0	a	yep , right .
28847	0	a	But it is also e e easier to put on versus like mobile covers
28848	0	a	you actually have to screw them on and stuff
28849	0	a	and you kind of sometimes have to get someone to do that for you .
28850	0	a	Okay .
28851	1	a	This is very much you should be able to stretch it over yourself
28852	0	a	and it will be fine .
28853	0	a	Yep .
28854	0	a	Okay ,
28855	0	a	good
28856	0	a	yeah .
28857	0	a	Yeah .
28858	0	a	Yeah .
28859	0	a	Yep , right .
28860	0	a	Li
28861	1	a	that will be the covers as well ,
28862	1	a	yeah
28863	1	a	yeah .
28864	0	a	Yeah .
28865	0	a	Yeah ,
28866	0	a	yeah .
28867	0	a	I mean tha it is it is a detailed point ,
28868	1	a	I just wondered I mean
28869	1	a	h how will people put these down I wonder ?
28870	0	a	Right .
28871	1	a	Like that .
28872	0	a	Okay
28873	0	a	for some strange re reason I had it in my mind that they would put them down vertically
28874	0	a	but
28875	0	a	Yeah , no
28876	0	a	because particularly if they have dif if they are going to have it as a you know as a fashion item
28877	0	a	I mean it
28878	0	a	it is it
28879	0	a	it is just
28880	0	a	I mean it is just a minor detailed point ,
28881	0	a	but as you say you can just make the base a little bit bigger
28882	0	a	and
28883	0	a	Yeah
28884	1	a	and it just needs another another logo somewhere is is is is all
28885	0	a	it gives gives people the option
28886	0	a	and if if say if they have got them
28887	1	a	because actually have several upon the
28888	0	a	Yeah , well .
28889	0	a	Yeah it could stand , yeah .
28890	0	a	Oh .
28891	0	a	Well
28892	1	a	we could broaden the broaden it out a bit
28893	0	a	so it would stand like that .
28894	0	a	Yeah , standing .
28895	0	a	Yeah ,
28896	1	a	we could just widen it out
28897	1	a	Could have one for your stereo , one for your DV player .
28898	0	a	, yeah ,
28899	0	a	yeah .
28900	0	a	Yeah .
28901	0	a	Have to
28902	1	a	if we just lengthen it I guess
28903	0	a	so it comes down to the base of the hand
28904	1	a	and then flatten it out
28905	0	a	and could sit there .
28906	0	a	Yeah ,
28907	0	a	just kind of
28908	1	a	Or just make it little .
28909	0	a	Yeah
28910	0	a	but that that is
28911	0	a	but
28912	0	a	no
28913	0	a	the the the overall the overall concept is
28914	0	a	yeah yeah ,
28915	0	a	no no ,
28916	0	a	I mean that is these
28917	0	a	Yeah .
28918	0	a	Yeah , .
28919	1	a	Somewhere like that
28920	0	a	so it just sort of
28921	0	a	Yeah .
28922	0	a	Yeah .
28923	0	a	Yeah .
28924	1	a	We might have to lengthen it
28925	0	a	so it kind of your hand still holds it and have it there ,
28926	0	a	yeah ,
28927	0	a	yeah ,
28928	0	a	yeah
28929	0	a	like that , like that .
28930	0	a	Yeah
28931	1	a	I kind of had a a kind of a natural kind of a idea
28932	1	a	where it is like more of a kind of like a kind of maybe slightly like thinner ,
28933	0	a	yeah , kind of like that
28934	1	a	kind of like a flower or a plant
28935	0	a	for the more natural kind of
28936	0	a	yeah ,
28937	1	a	just click there .
28938	0	a	Yeah .
28939	0	a	Bu .
28940	0	a	But yeah but no th but
28941	0	a	the yeah
28942	0	a	the the the
28943	0	a	Yeah ,
28944	0	a	yeah ,
28945	0	a	yeah ,
28946	0	a	I mean it it is would not
28947	0	a	would not do that , indeed yeah .
28948	0	a	fall over .
28949	0	a	The final product would actually stand up , yeah .
28950	0	a	Yeah .
28951	0	a	But th th but th
28952	0	a	yeah
28953	0	a	th
28954	0	a	b the
28955	0	a	these were all minor minor minor details ,
28956	0	a	I think the the basic concept i i is is absolutely bang on
28957	0	a	and the i
28958	0	a	it certainly meets our criteria of being of you know looking different .
28959	0	a	Yeah ,
28960	0	a	yeah .
28961	0	a	Yeah .
28962	0	a	Yeah .
28963	0	a	Is a little longer .
28964	0	a	Wee
28965	0	a	Yeah .
28966	0	a	, so
28967	0	a	good that is that that is excellent .
28968	0	a	right
28969	0	a	let us
28970	0	a	What is on the next one ?
28971	0	a	Oh right yes ,
28972	1	a	let is have a look at the f finance .
28973	0	a	, now
28974	0	a	we are given a a clear design brief ,
28975	1	a	if I get the spreadsheet up .
28976	0	a	Oh .
28977	1	a	the the maximise button .
28978	0	a	Oh right .
28979	0	a	Good ,
28980	0	a	this is why we need to make these things simple
28981	0	a	so that the the the the boss can understand .
28982	0	a	Now
28983	0	a	I have
28984	0	a	this is the company is costing for for various aspects of design and I I
28985	0	a	I have treated some of these slightly liberally given the constraints placed on us ,
28986	0	a	I would not know for in
28987	0	a	for instance if if they require us to have it in the corporate colours , then that is not a special colour , that is a that is a standard colour .
28988	0	a	, so
28989	0	a	we are just simply on batteries , the the one th the one decision I have had to make is that
28990	1	a	we are we will have to find a s a regular standard chip to to do this with
28991	0	a	and I I
28992	0	a	I am
28993	0	a	I am
28994	0	a	I am certain that they they are around
28995	0	a	so ,
28996	0	a	that I do not think is a a serious problem .
28997	0	a	The the the voice sensor is is expensive
28998	0	a	but we we made a a basic decision that that was absolutely fundamental to the to the design
28999	1	a	so that that has to stay .
29000	0	a	then again the the the the shape of the case means that it is it is expensive to l to make cause of the the th the double curves
29001	0	a	but on the other hand because of our overall fashion concept we we should exceed the the sales targets .
29002	0	a	it is simply made of plastic
29003	0	a	so th that is that is no problem
29004	0	a	and
29005	0	a	just because the whole the colour of the the whole thing that is there is some cost there .
29006	0	a	and
29007	0	a	we have not actually got a scroll wheel
29008	0	a	we
29009	0	a	we we got push buttons and and a simple slider
29010	0	a	so
29011	0	a	and the and the the buttons are
29012	0	a	well
29013	0	a	I do do not know that they are special colour .
29014	0	a	Anyway
29015	0	a	the the costings come in at exactly on target at twelve point five
29016	0	a	but I thi
29017	0	a	I think we have a a very strong case to argue that what what we have got is is so in innovative and and different
29018	0	a	that any any slight compromise we have to make on on cost is is offset by the
29019	0	a	you know
29020	0	a	the
29021	0	a	you know the the the the concept of it being a a fashion accessory and and having the the interchangeable covers
29022	0	a	so you know
29023	0	a	the if if
29024	0	a	if the management expect us to be techno again fail again technologically innovative that they they have to accept that we we ca not operate absolutely within the constraints that they give ,
29025	0	a	so
29026	1	a	we we we present this as the the company is the the company is way forward
29027	0	a	and
29028	0	a	I I think we can argue that we we have come in on on budget .
29029	0	a	Okay , .
29030	0	a	So .
29031	0	a	Does anybody want to
29032	0	a	Andrew do you want what do you want to say about the yeah the evaluation
29033	0	a	where where you know well where where we are where where we are at ?
29034	0	a	The the the well the
29035	0	a	I meant the product .
29036	0	a	Evaluation .
29037	0	a	The the product or the project ?
29038	0	a	, well well
29039	1	a	my presentation just now ?
29040	0	a	Sure ,
29041	1	a	can I get the
29042	0	a	Cheers .
29043	0	a	Yeah .
29044	0	a	Oh
29045	0	a	sorry
29046	0	a	yeah , .
29047	0	a	More loud clicks in the microphone .
29048	0	a	There we go , oh .
29049	0	a	Method of evaluation testing the product was to just if it met all the criteria all the conditions that we set out to set out to solve , from the point of view of the the consumer and the management .
29050	0	a	So
29051	0	a	what I have been asked to do is , on the whiteboard gauge our team response to these questions .
29052	0	a	So ,
29053	0	a	on a scale of one to seven , one being true and seven being being false .
29054	0	a	Seven being a nice round number to work to .
29055	0	a	Yeah .
29056	0	a	And then at the end just take an average
29057	0	a	Yes .
29058	0	a	Tr
29059	0	a	On for true and seven for flase .
29060	0	a	Yes .
29061	0	a	So .
29062	0	a	So ,
29063	1	a	look at these questions .
29064	0	a	Is the device f flashy and fashionable ?
29065	0	a	So
29066	0	a	and also technologically innovative ?
29067	0	a	Easy to use ?
29068	0	a	suitable for the consumer ?
29069	0	a	That was
29070	0	a	Yeah .
29071	0	a	Well
29072	0	a	I think most definitely .
29073	0	a	Yeah I would say definitely a one
29074	0	a	yeah .
29075	0	a	I think it is yeah .
29076	0	a	Yes
29077	0	a	the voice technology indeed .
29078	0	a	Yeah , defi
29079	0	a	yeah ,
29080	0	a	yeah
29081	0	a	Yeah .
29082	0	a	Yeah .
29083	0	a	I do not see we could have made it any easier .
29084	0	a	Yeah .
29085	0	a	Totally .
29086	0	a	Yeah definitely .
29087	0	a	Yeah I think it made we met all of the consumer wants .
29088	0	a	Yeah .
29089	0	a	is it complicated ?
29090	0	a	Doing pretty well so far
29091	0	a	are not we ? functional ?
29092	0	a	No .
29093	0	a	No .
29094	0	a	Yeah .
29095	0	a	Yeah definitely .
29096	0	a	Yeah .
29097	0	a	Where are we ?
29098	0	a	We have b built in the the speech , where are you , function .
29099	0	a	found easily .
29100	0	a	yeah
29101	0	a	I mean that is that is
29102	0	a	Yeah .
29103	0	a	Yeah .
29104	0	a	Yeah .
29105	0	a	Yeah , .
29106	0	a	Yeah .
29107	0	a	Uh huh .
29108	0	a	Does it take long to learn to use ?
29109	0	a	Should not .
29110	0	a	No , not at all .
29111	0	a	And ,
29112	0	a	what else ?
29113	0	a	The RSI compares to the current standards ,
29114	0	a	well .
29115	0	a	Less buttons
29116	0	a	so it must be .
29117	0	a	Yeah it is sorta the the handle more ergonomically correct as well .
29118	0	a	We we
29119	0	a	yeah
29120	0	a	it was our it was a
29121	0	a	we made an actual effort to
29122	0	a	will device appeal to all age groups ?
29123	0	a	Yeah , that is a good call , yeah .
29124	0	a	Yeah .
29125	0	a	So yeah , .
29126	0	a	yeah .
29127	0	a	I think it will
29128	0	a	because I mean old older people who ca not manage the buttons anyway will actually probably like the like like the voice bit so
29129	0	a	And it is it is it
29130	0	a	is
29131	0	a	well
29132	0	a	I do not think we are actually charging a particular premium anyway , in the end , so
29133	0	a	Yeah .
29134	0	a	I think so .
29135	0	a	Well
29136	0	a	we had the we had the data saying that old people will be less likely to pay extra money but the funct the increased functionality , the e ease of use of the device might make up for that .
29137	0	a	I I
29138	0	a	I think it will tend to appeal more to younger aged groups
29139	0	a	just cause we have gone with the fashion focus and the younger people tend to would be more conscious of that aspect of it ,
29140	0	a	but I think it should still appeal on a certain level to everybody , yeah .
29141	0	a	Yeah .
29142	0	a	Yeah .
29143	0	a	It will appeal f for dif for different reasons
29144	0	a	but it is it is
29145	0	a	yeah yeah
29146	0	a	so I I
29147	0	a	yeah
29148	0	a	I
29149	0	a	Yeah ,
29150	0	a	so
29151	1	a	I think we can reasonably say it is another another one ,
29152	0	a	why not ?
29153	0	a	in in in in my interpretation of management is instructions is that yes it it meets the requirement
29154	0	a	is t
29155	0	a	it is television only , it is it is simple to use , it is it is it is within budget ,
29156	0	a	I it is yes an an any minor points we we we argue .
29157	0	a	Yeah
29158	0	a	I think just the simplicity of it
29159	0	a	and
29160	0	a	not having to learn to programme and not having you know a million buttons .
29161	0	a	Yeah ,
29162	0	a	yeah .
29163	0	a	Yeah ,
29164	0	a	yeah .
29165	0	a	Yeah .
29166	1	a	can you just click the my mouse to move onto next page ?
29167	0	a	, yeah
29168	0	a	and what h did we make the management is
29169	0	a	Yep .
29170	0	a	Under the cost .
29171	0	a	Yep .
29172	0	a	So
29173	0	a	I I think we have done an amazing job
29174	0	a	in coming up with what
29175	0	a	Need a need a calculator for that .
29176	0	a	Yep .
29177	0	a	Okay .
29178	0	a	Well done us .
29179	0	a	So
29180	0	a	one two three four five six
29181	0	a	seven eight
29182	0	a	nine ten eleven .
29183	0	a	Eleven divided by eleven is one so equals average of one .
29184	0	a	Yeah , .
29185	0	a	Excellent .
29186	0	a	Okay ,
29187	1	a	nick the cable back then .
29188	0	a	I mixed up the colours a little bit .
29189	0	a	Oh no
29190	0	a	that is
29191	0	a	I think I all wrong .
29192	0	a	Ooh .
29193	0	a	Right
29194	0	a	do either of you want to say anything ?
29195	0	a	Before I
29196	0	a	No .
29197	0	a	Ps
29198	0	a	I do not think so ,
29199	0	a	I mean
29200	0	a	I think we worked well together and looked really at what the consumers wanted and what we were trying to make
29201	0	a	and you know ,
29202	0	a	seemed to discuss things pretty well and come to group consensus
29203	0	a	and
29204	0	a	Yeah .
29205	0	a	Yeah .
29206	0	a	Yeah .
29207	0	a	Well
29208	0	a	that is right ,
29209	0	a	I mean
29210	0	a	th this this slide here
29211	0	a	I mean the satisfaction with room for creativity ,
29212	0	a	I mean
29213	0	a	I think we have allowed ourselves as much creativity as the the the the product allows .
29214	0	a	Yeah , definitely .
29215	0	a	I wo not comment on leadership , teamwork I think we have
29216	0	a	I think everybody is worked pretty well together .
29217	0	a	we have just about coped with the whiteboard and digital pens ,
29218	0	a	I think the results speak for itself
29219	0	a	and new ideas found , , again gi no given relatively everyday product , I think we have v very very effectively come up with a a new a new approach .
29220	0	a	Yeah .
29221	0	a	Yep .
29222	0	a	are the costs within budget ?
29223	0	a	Yes .
29224	0	a	Is the project evaluated ?
29225	0	a	We are we are all happy that it it meets all the criteria ,
29226	0	a	Thank you very much indeed ,
29227	0	a	I think that I think that is
29228	0	a	I think we can go f for an early bath .
29229	0	a	Yep .
29230	0	a	Alright .
29231	0	a	Yeah .
29232	1	a	So I call the meeting closed .
29233	0	a	 
29234	0	a	Is this okay ?
29235	0	a	I know .
29236	0	a	yeah .
29237	0	a	Fine now .
29238	0	a	Oh ,
29239	0	a	it is not liking us , it went that a way .
29240	0	a	Computer adjusting .
29241	0	a	Oh .
29242	0	a	Okay .
29243	0	a	So .
29244	0	a	Right .
29245	0	a	You ready back there ?
29246	0	a	okay .
29247	0	a	Welcome everyone .
29248	0	a	this is the kick off meeting for the day .
29249	0	a	we are the new group to create a new remote control for Real Reaction .
29250	0	a	As you can see our agenda is to open up the meeting , become acquainted with each other , have a little training on tools , create a plan , discuss things and and we only have twenty minut twenty five minutes total .
29251	0	a	Okay .
29252	0	a	The new remote control is to be original , trendy and user friendly .
29253	1	a	That , Steph , is your part , is the user friendliness .
29254	1	a	The originality is going to take all of us .
29255	1	a	the trendiness we will probably go look at for some marketing research information from you , Sarah .
29256	1	a	and we will get on with it .
29257	0	a	Okay , so
29258	0	a	we will have a functional design individual work with meeting and then conceptual design t and then detailed design .
29259	0	a	Okay ?
29260	0	a	Right .
29261	0	a	Everybody is supposed to try out the whiteboard .
29262	1	a	Kate , why do not you try it first , if you can either bring your things with you , I guess
29263	0	a	And while you are doing that
29264	1	a	we will try and figure out how to hook these things on as well ,
29265	0	a	cause we are all going to have to be able to walk around .
29266	0	a	yeah ,
29267	0	a	if I can pick up with all these bits and pieces ,
29268	1	a	hang on .
29269	0	a	right , so
29270	0	a	you want an animal and the characteristics of that animal .
29271	0	a	Do you have to be able to recognise what animal it is ?
29272	0	a	Only animal I could thin I could draw .
29273	0	a	I do not think so
29274	0	a	, I think it is just to try out the whiteboard .
29275	0	a	Are we all going to draw a cat ?
29276	0	a	That is not a mouse y , no .
29277	0	a	Its a sort of bunny rabbit cat .
29278	0	a	You can tell it is not a bunny rabbit by the ears .
29279	0	a	Uh huh .
29280	1	a	I suppose it should have a mouth as well , sort of
29281	0	a	Right
29282	0	a	, yeah .
29283	0	a	Okay .
29284	0	a	Great .
29285	0	a	And the characteristics ?
29286	0	a	Uh huh .
29287	0	a	the favourite characteristics of the cat the whiskers I think , because they are the easiest to draw .
29288	1	a	In fact , I will give it some more
29289	0	a	Oh ,
29290	0	a	and the tail
29291	0	a	Yes .
29292	0	a	Okay .
29293	0	a	Fantastic .
29294	0	a	Since you are handy as well ,
29295	1	a	why do not you do yours next , Steph .
29296	0	a	I think it is to get us used to using the pen .
29297	0	a	sure it is not to test our artistic It is a mouse .
29298	0	a	no .
29299	0	a	A mouse y ?
29300	0	a	Oh .
29301	0	a	No it is not a mouse .
29302	0	a	It is a wombat .
29303	0	a	It is a ratty .
29304	0	a	Argh .
29305	0	a	A what ?
29306	0	a	A webbed foot .
29307	0	a	A ratty .
29308	0	a	Rat .
29309	0	a	Not a mouse , a rat .
29310	0	a	Webbed f
29311	0	a	Oh right .
29312	0	a	It is clothes .
29313	0	a	That is it is clothes .
29314	0	a	It is a ratty with a with a with a very long tail .
29315	1	a	And your favourite characteristics of that animal .
29316	0	a	I love whiskers .
29317	0	a	they are intelligent and they are cheeky and fantastic pets and very friendly .
29318	0	a	Oh .
29319	0	a	Okay .
29320	0	a	And they sit on your shoulder and whisper the answers to your homework in your ear when you are doing your homework .
29321	1	a	Kate ?
29322	0	a	Oh ,
29323	0	a	a fish .
29324	0	a	Thanks .
29325	0	a	A shark ?
29326	0	a	It is true
29327	0	a	that you always sit around you know , you are sitting on your sofa and you want to change something , there is five different remotes , and one for the DVD and one for the video and one for cable and one for whatever else .
29328	0	a	Gosh ,
29329	0	a	why did not I think of fish ?
29330	0	a	That is even easier to draw than cat .
29331	0	a	this is very representational fish .
29332	0	a	Oh , okay .
29333	0	a	Fine .
29334	0	a	I like them because they are sleek and they have a lot of freedom
29335	0	a	but they also do n swim in groups ,
29336	0	a	so .
29337	0	a	Favourite characteristics ?
29338	0	a	Kay .
29339	0	a	So
29340	0	a	they have team elements .
29341	0	a	Do you have a favourite one ?
29342	0	a	yeah .
29343	0	a	I am afraid I am with Steph .
29344	0	a	And I think your pen is running out of whatever .
29345	0	a	But I am afraid I take the coward is way out ,
29346	0	a	and the cat is looking the other way .
29347	0	a	He is hiding .
29348	0	a	cats are sometimes very independent .
29349	0	a	My parents had cats .
29350	0	a	and they can decide for themselves what is best .
29351	0	a	Okay .
29352	0	a	Now
29353	1	a	we have to get down to the nitty gritty of how to make this
29354	0	a	and this remote control has to be sold
29355	0	a	we are to sell it for twenty five Euros , with a profit aim ultimately of fifty million Euros .
29356	0	a	That tells you something about how many we have to sell on an international scale .
29357	0	a	would be an awful lot of these , would be like what , a hundred million of them to make twenty five Euros on each one and to make a total profit of fifty million .
29358	0	a	the production is to only cost twelve and a half Euros per item .
29359	0	a	Now
29360	0	a	if they cost twelve and a half , you are selling it for twenty five , you are making twelve and a half Euros each .
29361	0	a	and we are to make a profit of fifty million ,
29362	0	a	that is t
29363	0	a	can you do the maths
29364	0	a	and how many are we selling ?
29365	0	a	Mark up ?
29366	0	a	Okay .
29367	0	a	I was just wondering if that is the If fifty percent is normal
29368	0	a	B
29369	0	a	yeah .
29370	0	a	I would think would be more like sixty percent .
29371	1	a	But let me
29372	0	a	I have two thoughts .
29373	0	a	One hundred , fifty percent .
29374	0	a	And and your question is how many do we have to sell ?
29375	0	a	At twenty five .
29376	0	a	Yes , cause our market is international
29377	0	a	and your problem is has to do with marketing of
29378	0	a	you know ,
29379	1	a	you gotta know how many we are going to be selling to know how big a market you have to target and who is that .
29380	0	a	Yeah ,
29381	0	a	that is
29382	0	a	So
29383	0	a	that is four million of them ?
29384	0	a	Yeah .
29385	0	a	To give you a pretty good idea of where you are looking .
29386	0	a	Something like that ?
29387	0	a	Okay .
29388	0	a	That is fifty million Euros .
29389	0	a	In order to make fifty million Euros , and you are only getting twelve and a half each That is a lot of selling .
29390	0	a	And if we make
29391	0	a	Yeah .
29392	0	a	Two four To be fifty , be
29393	0	a	four million .
29394	0	a	Four million .
29395	0	a	You would have to sell four million .
29396	0	a	Okay ?
29397	0	a	Right .
29398	1	a	Experience with a remote control .
29399	0	a	Any of you use of remote control for a television or DVD or something ?
29400	0	a	You are both nodding , all three .
29401	0	a	That that that is the sorta product we are talking about , one that will work for a in a home environment , for a TVs and
29402	1	a	I think one that works would be good .
29403	0	a	Yeah .
29404	0	a	Well
29405	0	a	I have seen some remote controls that are for more than one device at a time , but I also have heard about them not working well or not well co ordinated and you wind up working with this one for thi this three
29406	0	a	and then this one over here for another .
29407	0	a	Y
29408	0	a	yeah .
29409	0	a	And they do not always talk to each other .
29410	0	a	But I presume this is t I presume this is just for television .
29411	0	a	Do not know .
29412	0	a	Okay .
29413	1	a	Are there any ideas for the remote ?
29414	1	a	What would it be for
29415	1	a	and what group would be be for ?
29416	1	a	We have to think about that one .
29417	1	a	We could make a Hello Kitty themed remote .
29418	1	a	I think one in b bright colours would be good .
29419	0	a	Yeah .
29420	1	a	We could totally go for the Japan a mation .
29421	0	a	Well
29422	0	a	I mean there is also the cachet that the Japanese make great products .
29423	0	a	Electrical
29424	0	a	their industrial design is very good .
29425	1	a	I think one that does not have lots of superfluous functions .
29426	0	a	Like I have got one at home that has well , apart from the obvious , channels , channel up , channel down , volume , you know , subtitles , mute , there is a lotta buttons that I have got no idea what they do , like .
29427	0	a	Yeah .
29428	0	a	Well ,
29429	0	a	that is a really good point ,
29430	0	a	because I think one of the things that being somewhat computer literate , we tend to go to menus and then make choices ,
29431	0	a	you know ,
29432	1	a	so if it is like an volume button , you know , you can go in and say mute or or volume .
29433	0	a	Okay .
29434	1	a	We do not need to have like the l the numbers if we also have channel up channel down .
29435	0	a	Okay .
29436	1	a	We can make it smart like an iPod ,
29437	0	a	you know ,
29438	1	a	make everything menus .
29439	0	a	Ooh ,
29440	0	a	closing the meeting .
29441	0	a	Yeah .
29442	0	a	I know this sounds like it was very quick ,
29443	0	a	but the
29444	0	a	I think that is the industrial design is the first one , that is Kate , for the working design .
29445	0	a	That was quick .
29446	0	a	And user , that is you S Steph , for the technical functions design , and for marketing the user requirements specification .
29447	0	a	I think there is going to be a lot of
29448	1	a	we have to help each other and work through this as a group ,
29449	0	a	and I think we all , you know , we like our kitty cat and our rat and our fish ,
29450	1	a	but I think we all have to like each other to get this done .
29451	0	a	as it says , we are going to get individual instructions , but I do not think they allowed a lot of extra time ,
29452	1	a	so I think a little bit of less of this and more at do will set us in good stead .
29453	0	a	Do you all agree ?
29454	0	a	Alright .
29455	0	a	then I do not see any reason to prolong it
29456	1	a	and f we should finish this meeting at ni right now and go into other things .
29457	0	a	Alright ,
29458	0	a	so this is the end of the first meeting .
29459	0	a	 
29460	0	a	it fell off .
29461	0	a	One , two , three , four ,
29462	0	a	yeah , we are ready .
29463	0	a	Okay .
29464	0	a	Welcome to this second meeting .
29465	0	a	it is now quarter after twelve and we are given forty minutes for this meeting .
29466	0	a	This is a meeting on functional design .
29467	0	a	and I want to welcome you all and thank you all for doing some research in between .
29468	0	a	I did took the minutes from the first meeting
29469	1	a	and I will show them to you in a moment .
29470	0	a	I know each of you have a presentation
29471	1	a	and in thinking about the forty minutes , I thought it would take only like three minutes for the previous minutes , each of you having about seven minutes or maybe a little more , maybe a little less for your pre presentations and a little discussion ,
29472	0	a	because there is I happen to have been told there were some new project requirements
29473	1	a	and we have to make some decision on what functions it will have .
29474	0	a	Okay ?
29475	0	a	Is this ap
29476	0	a	everybody agree with this ?
29477	0	a	Okay .
29478	0	a	Yes .
29479	0	a	Oops .
29480	0	a	Yes .
29481	0	a	and after the meeting there will be things to be done and as you can see it says we get to get lunch , and then some more individual work and then putting minutes away and individual actions .
29482	0	a	but now
29483	1	a	for the minutes of the first meeting .
29484	0	a	And go to that one .
29485	0	a	as you can see it was this earlier today .
29486	0	a	Kate , Steph , Sarah and myself in our four capacities were present .
29487	0	a	I opened the meeting , the product was developed and reviewed , and we talked about the financial end of it .
29488	0	a	and it had some implications , the four million sales target and new ideas of not too many buttons , bright colours and some of the influence of the Japanese .
29489	0	a	And we closed early so you could then proceed with your research and getting your reports together for tod this meeting
29490	0	a	Anybody have any questions on those minutes ?
29491	0	a	Are they complete , did they discuss everything that we covered last time ?
29492	1	a	Kay .
29493	0	a	I think so ,
29494	0	a	we we
29495	0	a	we talked about the the individual roles that we each had as well .
29496	0	a	Did I miss something ?
29497	0	a	Yeah .
29498	0	a	I am afraid I incorporated that when I said who was present ,
29499	0	a	but yes , we did ,
29500	0	a	and we did a little bit of team building of of making the pictures ,
29501	0	a	but I did not think those were appropriate to the minutes necessarily .
29502	0	a	Okay .
29503	0	a	So
29504	0	a	as a group I think we have are they are accepting the minutes .
29505	0	a	Okay , I accept the minutes .
29506	0	a	And
29507	0	a	okay .
29508	0	a	Is that what we are supposed to say ?
29509	0	a	Okay .
29510	0	a	Yeah .
29511	0	a	Yeah , I do .
29512	0	a	Good .
29513	1	a	, then we will move to the three presentations .
29514	0	a	Okay ?
29515	0	a	Okay .
29516	1	a	we need to move this .
29517	1	a	Who wants to go f first ?
29518	0	a	That is as far as it goes .
29519	1	a	not really meant to touch those microphones .
29520	0	a	Oh it does not have any on ,
29521	0	a	does it ?
29522	0	a	That is fine .
29523	0	a	Excellent , thank you .
29524	0	a	Oy ,
29525	0	a	big loop under the table .
29526	0	a	She said we did not need to screw it in .
29527	0	a	Okay .
29528	0	a	Okay , that looks good .
29529	0	a	It is doing its thing .
29530	0	a	There we are .
29531	0	a	Alright .
29532	0	a	Thank you very much .
29533	0	a	One of the the biggest issues I found about from last meeting was the fact that we need to sell four million of these remote controls
29534	1	a	and I think that this is an opportunity to really take Real Reaction in the direction of of similar of handheld tools that have been used and are used by many of us and to kind of bring the remote control into the si same realm as an accessible useful electronic device , as opposed to something that is lost in the couch and what have you .
29535	0	a	So
29536	1	a	my main goal here is to re envision the remote control in in this context
29537	1	a	and to think about menu functionality and current technology and the fact that it could be interactive with other tools .
29538	0	a	some of the research in the market has shown that people really are not happy with remote controls as they are now ,
29539	1	a	and that means we do need to make some decisions about what what keys or or buttons on the on the remote control to perhaps keep and and what ones to discard .
29540	1	a	And if we devote some energy into this , I think the recent productions of Real Reaction , the I go everywhere power and the high definition DVD players although it makes immediate sense to have our remote control interact with these , I think we can also use this as a platform to make it interact with other tools .
29541	0	a	And in fact I think the high definition DVD players and all of this will come along in the will only benefit from the positive feedback from our well designed tool .
29542	0	a	So
29543	0	a	again , most users really dislike the current look and feel of remote controls .
29544	0	a	fifty percent
29545	0	a	I think of all these numbers the most important is
29546	0	a	fifty percent of user say they only use ten percent of the buttons .
29547	0	a	And eighty percent of users ,
29548	0	a	and if we think about this there are a lot of television , DVD , stereo remote control users out there , eighty percent would spend more money on a remote control that looks fancy .
29549	0	a	Could can I ask where these figures come from , is this market research we have
29550	0	a	it was market research and there were a hundred people in the room , so eighty out of a hundred said they would spend more money .
29551	0	a	Now
29552	0	a	in between , as the Project Manager , they sent me an email from the powers that be that teletext is outdated and the internet is coming in as important , but that they want this remote control to only be for TV with incorporating the corporate image , colour and slogan .
29553	0	a	Well
29554	0	a	I think we can I
29555	0	a	I think we can really focus on this remote and and again bring the Real Reaction brand in in and and get some positive marketing for our other tools , even if we directly do not advertise for the I go everywhere line .
29556	0	a	So
29557	0	a	an interesting element was the would you pay more for speech recognition question .
29558	0	a	So
29559	0	a	these market research questionnaires looked into your your concern about technology and s specifically wanted to find out information about speech recognition .
29560	0	a	Okay .
29561	0	a	Now
29562	0	a	the early adopters , those of us who grew up with technology and luck lucky for us have the cash to to pay for it , the young age group without the mortgages and responsibilities , ninety one percent of them would pay more for speech recognition in a remote control .
29563	0	a	Very interesting ,
29564	1	a	I
29565	1	a	I leave this up to the group to decide if we want to use this
29566	1	a	if and you know , the the designers ,
29567	0	a	but ninety one percent , fifteen to twenty five
29568	0	a	Well ,
29569	0	a	I
29570	0	a	I
29571	0	a	I think especially in terms of growth
29572	0	a	, I think this would be a very smart group to target .
29573	0	a	Is that a large enough target market to target it ?
29574	0	a	In real numbers , does the ninety one percent and the seventy six percent translate to ex in excess of the four million ?
29575	0	a	Or eight million .
29576	0	a	I mean s three quarters of the next age group ,
29577	0	a	twenty five to thirty five are interested ,
29578	0	a	and with the technologies improving , if we can get these
29579	0	a	Yeah .
29580	0	a	To
29581	0	a	yes .
29582	0	a	Yes .
29583	0	a	But would you pay more and does it work and is it approachable
29584	0	a	and and did I know that it was it was an
29585	0	a	that is a that is a very good question .
29586	0	a	Yeah .
29587	0	a	I do not know if speech recognition should be should be included , but I think it is an interesting
29588	0	a	I think that maybe shows more about being open to technology .
29589	0	a	How d I am wondering how how ou how our target price compares with the the typical price of these things .
29590	1	a	it definitely needs a lot more research
29591	0	a	on like how much more it would be and any , you know , existing examples , and what reactions to them have been , and that sort of thing .
29592	0	a	Shall I go back ?
29593	0	a	Yeah ,
29594	0	a	yeah .
29595	0	a	Yeah .
29596	0	a	I expect an Industrial Designer should know that ,
29597	0	a	but if we are aiming to to build this thing for twelve Euros fifty , is that a lot or a little ?
29598	0	a	Sh surely he is in the wrong age group .
29599	0	a	Exactly .
29600	0	a	I mean
29601	0	a	I I
29602	0	a	I did not receive any information on that ,
29603	0	a	but I think the competition , sussing out what other people are doing and what is in the pipeline is very very important ,
29604	0	a	because there is a question about do you want an LCD screen and and that was not responded to , but some of the larger remotes do have screens where you can navigate ,
29605	0	a	you know ,
29606	0	a	so it turns into something
29607	0	a	perhaps you all have seen the Osbournes where Ozzy Osbourne is is attempting to manage his super entertainment system with something that looks like a a small tray .
29608	0	a	You know ,
29609	0	a	it is I a
29610	0	a	and I think ,
29611	0	a	you know
29612	0	a	No , no ,
29613	0	a	you
29614	0	a	Kate , you are exactly right there .
29615	0	a	He must be w one of a s small population .
29616	1	a	But I think the key is to get the early adopters , people who are familiar with technology
29617	0	a	and and they will be
29618	0	a	But we are not looking at whether they are early adopters on that screen , that is looking at age groups .
29619	0	a	Exactly .
29620	0	a	I yes ,
29621	0	a	and I am making and I am making the the leap that people who are familiar younger people are l are more familiar with technology than than older people .
29622	0	a	Leap .
29623	0	a	Or comfortable ,
29624	0	a	you know , so
29625	1	a	I think the most important thing is an attractive streamlined remote control and to be extraordinarily reductionist , power , channel , volume and everything else is is up to the designers .
29626	0	a	Okay ,
29627	0	a	you had the other power channel .
29628	0	a	And this is this is also supported by the market research .
29629	0	a	Okay .
29630	0	a	Thank you .
29631	0	a	That is my contribution .
29632	0	a	Alright .
29633	1	a	And we will turn to the next presentation .
29634	0	a	I think she said we do not need to screw it in , just stick it in .
29635	1	a	And then press , what ?
29636	1	a	F FN and F eight .
29637	0	a	Next to the control button on the bottom , and then F eight at the top .
29638	0	a	Yeah , press them .
29639	1	a	And then w be patient .
29640	0	a	Yeah , here we go .
29641	0	a	Tada .
29642	1	a	And if you want it to go into slide show mode , it is that little button there .
29643	0	a	Can I not just do each one in order ?
29644	0	a	That ?
29645	0	a	That ?
29646	0	a	That ?
29647	0	a	Right ,
29648	0	a	technical functions design .
29649	0	a	I you can if you like ,
29650	0	a	it it that that just sets it up to do a p a p
29651	0	a	no
29652	0	a	that one , that one there .
29653	0	a	There we are .
29654	0	a	Yay .
29655	0	a	Left , left a bit , left a bit , that one , yep .
29656	0	a	well
29657	0	a	I think first off , basically I do agree with what Sarah has defined as as your personal preferences,
29658	0	a	yeah .
29659	0	a	I think we need a more streamlined volume with no extraneous functions .
29660	0	a	So
29661	0	a	my method was to look at the existing remotes and what functions they have .
29662	0	a	And what we all need to discuss is whether we want these functions pretty much the same as what existing remotes have .
29663	0	a	If we can build on this with the speech recognition ,
29664	0	a	that is not something I would thought about at all ,
29665	1	a	but it is also something we can discuss .
29666	0	a	Okay .
29667	1	a	and and I presume we can miss out the functions really to to a video or DVD remote control , if this is only going to be a , you know , satellite , cable , TV remote control .
29668	0	a	TV only .
29669	0	a	So
29670	0	a	these are two models of existing remote controls .
29671	0	a	the one on the left seems to be a fairly standard universal remote control .
29672	0	a	Ugh .
29673	0	a	It has fast forward , stop , play , all relating to movies .
29674	0	a	It also has seems to have channel up and channel down , which is which is more what you would expect from a , you know , like a Sky or cable remote control where you have got hundreds of channels instead of a merely terrestrial one .
29675	1	a	but I think we should be looking more along the lines of the one on the right ,
29676	0	a	which has it also has play , stop and pause and everything ,
29677	1	a	I do not think we need them at all .
29678	1	a	I think we just need channel selection , volume up , volume down
29679	1	a	and I think an an enter function where you can access it is not like teletext , but along the same lines , access things on the screen .
29680	0	a	not related to the internet one that you mentioned , because that would be far outside our budget and what we want this to do .
29681	0	a	And exceed the requirements they are expecting of us .
29682	0	a	So
29683	0	a	it
29684	0	a	really exceed the requirements ,
29685	0	a	cause the requirements really are just want to be able to change channels and functions ,
29686	1	a	which is more a text on the screen thing than than actual buttons
29687	0	a	o
29688	1	a	I was thinking something some smooth , sleek , little remote control with big user friendly buttons and a menu that you can access .
29689	0	a	Okay .
29690	0	a	Alright .
29691	1	a	but then I do think we need to discuss the speech recognition possibility .
29692	0	a	Okay .
29693	0	a	Any thing else you want to add ?
29694	0	a	Okay .
29695	0	a	No .
29696	1	a	But we could go back to the pictures of the , what are they called ?
29697	1	a	The pictures of the remote controls and possibly discuss what we think about them , but maybe should hear what Kate has to say first .
29698	0	a	Or if
29699	0	a	Yeah .
29700	0	a	Yeah .
29701	0	a	Let is hear what Kate has to say .
29702	0	a	Okay then .
29703	1	a	Maybe afterwards we could do a whiteboard with that your the one on the right as a as a basis .
29704	1	a	Whiteboard session .
29705	0	a	I think the white that one on the right is , as well as less cluttered , It is there
29706	0	a	but it is
29707	0	a	Yeah .
29708	0	a	Definitely less cluttered
29709	0	a	and I mean
29710	0	a	but still it is
29711	0	a	Sorry
29712	0	a	I was just
29713	1	a	I will just resume something else I was going to say .
29714	0	a	The the style of these is terrible .
29715	0	a	I I
29716	0	a	I really think we need to
29717	1	a	not only possibly even materials , like the type of plastic used , but everything including size and shape of buttons , positioning of buttons , the actual shape of the hand held device , colours ,
29718	1	a	just every e
29719	1	a	yeah , everything to do with this has to be revolutionised .
29720	1	a	The ergonomics , the way it fits in your
29721	0	a	Yeah .
29722	0	a	But
29723	0	a	So
29724	0	a	that is that for now .
29725	0	a	Cheers .
29726	0	a	, I have not actually got a display on my screen .
29727	0	a	Okay .
29728	1	a	Still , I will do without that .
29729	0	a	Okay , now
29730	1	a	I want to bring us down to earth again I am afraid and talk about the actual practicalities of how the thing needs to work .
29731	0	a	oh
29732	0	a	and this is the methodology I used in preparing for this meeting .
29733	0	a	basically
29734	0	a	I have been doing a little bit of web based research , and if I had a design team , I would have been discussing my ideas with them .
29735	0	a	But the the net result is that I have come up with a first cut for the working design
29736	1	a	that I would like to discuss with you .
29737	0	a	So ,
29738	1	a	let is go back to what the basic function of a remote control is .
29739	0	a	It is for sending a message , typically via infrared .
29740	0	a	And the the basic components we have got to build in for our twelve Euros fifty are an energy source , the user interface
29741	0	a	and
29742	0	a	which will in incorporate an integrated circuit that actually composes the message based on what the which buttons the user presses , we turn that into a message , and then we need a sending mechanism to send it to the receiver .
29743	0	a	Now
29744	0	a	I would have hoped
29745	0	a	I think that is my only slide actually ,
29746	0	a	yeah .
29747	0	a	I would have have hoped to do you a pretty PowerPoint slide of my first cut design , but unfortunately the technology defeated me ,
29748	1	a	so if you will bear with me
29749	1	a	I will do it on the whiteboard .
29750	0	a	So
29751	0	a	we want an energy source which is there .
29752	1	a	And we have got to think about what that might be .
29753	1	a	we obviously do not want wires on this thing .
29754	0	a	Hmm mm .
29755	0	a	typically it would be a battery ,
29756	1	a	but I am open to suggestions .
29757	0	a	and
29758	0	a	then we have the the user interface .
29759	0	a	Oops .
29760	0	a	And the main components in there are the the th the chip that actually has the intelligence of the machine that translates button presses into a message , which it then transfers to some sending mechanism , which encodes it and sends the message to the receiver .
29761	0	a	So
29762	0	a	those are the basic things that we have got to get in for our twelve Euros fifty .
29763	0	a	Thank you .
29764	0	a	Okay .
29765	0	a	Right .
29766	0	a	But those things as long as we can get those components ,
29767	0	a	the block , that that rectangle for the user interface , is where the user comes in
29768	0	a	of
29769	1	a	what what does it look like ?
29770	1	a	What do the buttons look like ?
29771	1	a	what does it feel like ?
29772	0	a	That is where the user interface is really coming into its own .
29773	0	a	The technical end is what is actually going to be in there ,
29774	1	a	but also it has to be easy enough to change or repair if something goes wrong .
29775	1	a	For example the battery energy source
29776	0	a	or what if the chip , for whatever reason , breaks down after a certain amount of time , do you just replace it ?
29777	0	a	is there any
29778	0	a	because it may be in the same area with several other user interfaces , like for DVDs , movies , whatever .
29779	0	a	does it have to have a a way of being segregated from the others , in a different frequency or something ?
29780	0	a	Well
29781	0	a	I may be wrong here ,
29782	1	a	but I would been thinking of this device as being a a cheap mass produced device .
29783	0	a	We are trying to sell four million of them , that is that is , you know , that is almost one in every tenth household or whatever it is .
29784	1	a	and I had not thought of it as being a reparable thing ,
29785	0	a	you just
29786	1	a	if it goes wrong you chuck it out ,
29787	0	a	and that is why I am a bit concerned .
29788	0	a	Okay .
29789	0	a	I like the idea of speech recognition , that is a great idea , but I am not convinced we can put it into this box for the price that we need going to need to hit .
29790	0	a	Do we have ki some idea of how much it would cost to create a device that has these basic elements ?
29791	0	a	Because then
29792	0	a	No , the chip composer marketing .
29793	0	a	Whoop .
29794	0	a	Okay .
29795	0	a	Is not that your job ?
29796	0	a	Oh right .
29797	0	a	Oh .
29798	0	a	Oh no ,
29799	0	a	the chip composer sender .
29800	1	a	, I am I am
29801	1	a	I am hoping that my personal coach is going to give me some advice on that , if you are asking me ,
29802	0	a	but
29803	0	a	Yeah .
29804	0	a	I I do not believe I know , .
29805	0	a	What they cost .
29806	0	a	Okay .
29807	0	a	Okay .
29808	0	a	Be because then we would ha ha figure out how much we had to play with in terms of user interface and this look and feel idea .
29809	0	a	Yeah .
29810	0	a	It does it does seem as if we are just to do something really simple and mass produced ,
29811	0	a	the
29812	1	a	which is pretty much the same as these existing models , just maybe a little bit more inspired , but basically just the same .
29813	0	a	Inspired ?
29814	0	a	Although what what suddenly came into my head is , you know how they always take two AA batteries
29815	0	a	which which is really not very efficient at all .
29816	0	a	Could it be possible to have , you know , like a rechargeable internal battery , like , well , like an MP three player does ?
29817	0	a	With that you could jus or a mobile phone or whatever .
29818	0	a	You could you know , you just plug into a power source for a couple of hours , and then it is recharged for ages and ages and ages , and you do not have to worry with replacing AA batteries ,
29819	0	a	which are
29820	0	a	You would never need batteries
29821	0	a	would y
29822	0	a	yeah .
29823	0	a	Well
29824	0	a	that has another element , which is if every time you are done using the remote you put it on a charger , then you then it has a place .
29825	0	a	Yeah ,
29826	0	a	but it also has a place ,
29827	0	a	so
29828	0	a	exactly .
29829	0	a	And it is not stuck down the back of the sofa .
29830	0	a	But then again I d I do not know if this is within our price range or not .
29831	0	a	That is a really good idea .
29832	0	a	Well
29833	0	a	I think that is a very interesting idea ,
29834	0	a	but I am not a very good industrial designer
29835	0	a	and I do not know much about what these things cost .
29836	1	a	I will do some research for the next meeting .
29837	0	a	Well
29838	0	a	it is better than my idea about solar , probably .
29839	0	a	Okay .
29840	0	a	yeah .
29841	0	a	Well
29842	0	a	solar may not be so good when you are watching TV in the night ,
29843	0	a	but
29844	0	a	Yeah , I guess .
29845	0	a	Yeah ,
29846	0	a	yeah .
29847	0	a	Well
29848	0	a	it is just so annoying how
29849	0	a	No ,
29850	0	a	but just a rechargeable internal battery would probably I mean it might cost more to at first to develop and to install ,
29851	0	a	but for long term use it will be so much more convenient and economic than fiddling around trying to replace chunky AA batteries and not having any in your kitchen drawer
29852	0	a	and you know f
29853	0	a	Depen
29854	1	a	It would have to sor store up the energy and then use it .
29855	0	a	Yeah .
29856	0	a	Solar can do that .
29857	0	a	We may be talking quite heavy then .
29858	0	a	Yeah .
29859	0	a	M
29860	0	a	yeah , that would be too heavy and it would cost too much .
29861	0	a	So
29862	0	a	do you think we might make that a selling point if it was something that we found we could afford to develop ?
29863	0	a	Definitely ,
29864	0	a	cause I am thinking in terms of the loss and breakage of remotes , how much of that is is to do with it not really having a a home , a a nest , a place to live ,
29865	0	a	exactly .
29866	1	a	Sort of have its little dock that you could put it in .
29867	0	a	Yeah .
29868	0	a	So if you can dock it , you know , you could s argue that this is
29869	0	a	Exactly .
29870	1	a	And the dock could look very fancy and that could be your inspiration of having it looking decent .
29871	0	a	Still I do not know if it is quite within our price range .
29872	0	a	Cause you are talking about another component , like another piece of hardware .
29873	0	a	Yeah .
29874	0	a	Yeah .
29875	0	a	Okay .
29876	0	a	Are we agreed as to what our target group is though ?
29877	0	a	Pretty much ,
29878	1	a	so that we would be looking for the younger end .
29879	0	a	Well
29880	0	a	I I brought up some
29881	0	a	exactly , but I think you raised some good questions
29882	0	a	about are there enough of these people out there , or are they making purchasing decisions ?
29883	0	a	You know ,
29884	0	a	these are the
29885	0	a	Yeah , exactly .
29886	0	a	Yeah ,
29887	0	a	I was wondering that ,
29888	0	a	because I ag I agree that there there are people with how can I put it , more money than sense and who are liable to buy something new ,
29889	0	a	but
29890	0	a	Bu but what I was going to say was , although they they may be buying , you know , personal music devices and all that ,
29891	0	a	are they necessarily buying TV remote controls ?
29892	0	a	Because they probably live in a household that has a TV if they are at the lower end of the age range , I do not know .
29893	0	a	I
29894	0	a	I s usually put more money than brains .
29895	0	a	Oh oh oh
29896	1	a	I will make a note of that , Kate .
29897	0	a	Good , good comment .
29898	0	a	Yeah .
29899	0	a	Yeah .
29900	1	a	It might be good to know
29901	0	a	who , you know , who is actually buying televisions and are we in a s region where people have more than one television in a home ?
29902	0	a	Yeah .
29903	0	a	I think we have got a big hill to climb here ,
29904	0	a	have not we ?
29905	0	a	I mean we have gotta persuade people who have got a remote control cause it came with the telly that they should buy our product instead .
29906	0	a	Yeah .
29907	0	a	Yeah .
29908	0	a	Or do we s make sure that it goes to the man through the manufacturer ?
29909	1	a	We sell to the manufacturer as the remote that goes with it .
29910	0	a	Right , good point .
29911	0	a	Yeah ,
29912	0	a	yeah
29913	0	a	okay ,
29914	0	a	yeah .
29915	0	a	Yeah .
29916	0	a	Yeah .
29917	0	a	Yeah .
29918	0	a	Yeah .
29919	0	a	That is probably more what it is .
29920	0	a	Yeah , good point .
29921	0	a	What would be a more efficient way of doing it ?
29922	0	a	Yeah ,
29923	0	a	and and some of our DVD players incidentally have them , because we have the relationship with our own department ,
29924	1	a	but moreover we need to to go for the the manufacturers .
29925	0	a	Okay .
29926	0	a	Right .
29927	0	a	We are not going to get any resolutions by the end of the day ,
29928	0	a	are we ?
29929	0	a	Yeah .
29930	0	a	Probably not .
29931	0	a	the other thing that we are supposed to do is make decision on our functions .
29932	0	a	Our functions , we have so far decided , I think , that power , channel , volume make it attractive .
29933	0	a	it has to have an enter key and of course the number keys .
29934	0	a	It has to have big user friendly buttons and sh
29935	0	a	n definitely we want to be inspired
29936	0	a	that the current styles are just plain awful .
29937	0	a	Do we need let me
29938	0	a	Br actually ,
29939	0	a	the enter key
29940	0	a	I have a chart here that I did not include .
29941	0	a	Is that agreeable to everyone ?
29942	0	a	yeah ,
29943	0	a	which might
29944	0	a	Th
29945	0	a	yeah ,
29946	0	a	th those are
29947	0	a	felt like had a lot of charts .
29948	0	a	Do you want the gizmo ?
29949	0	a	H how does that work ?
29950	1	a	How so so how does that work , how do you avoid switching the thing off when you actually want to press enter ?
29951	0	a	Okay , yep , .
29952	0	a	Throw some light on that .
29953	0	a	actually we are , you know , we are almost a half hour out of the forty minutes ,
29954	1	a	so we have to get close to finishing .
29955	0	a	Okay ,
29956	0	a	I I
29957	1	a	my only comment is I think maybe we could somehow include an enter key in like a power key if power power was enter and pow that was my only just really in terms of streamlining .
29958	0	a	Okay .
29959	0	a	Exactly .
29960	0	a	Enter , power as a s oh a sum simultaneous key .
29961	0	a	Again , you know ,
29962	0	a	thinking of menus or
29963	0	a	well
29964	0	a	if you are pressing enter , the the thing would already be on ,
29965	1	a	and so maybe when you press power , initially it turns it on , press power again and use that as an enter
29966	0	a	so you press power after you have
29967	0	a	well
29968	1	a	I was thinking maybe you to turn it off you would have to press power twice in succession , and maybe power follows something like a channel up channel down power , and then that would make that choice .
29969	0	a	Is that okay with you ?
29970	0	a	Would that
29971	0	a	uh huh .
29972	0	a	Sorry ,
29973	0	a	I was miles away .
29974	0	a	I was re
29975	0	a	I was reading the chart to be honest .
29976	1	a	Then you would have to have an off te off key .
29977	0	a	It is not getting a bit complicated ?
29978	0	a	Could granny do this ,
29979	0	a	or are we just not aiming at granny ?
29980	0	a	Well
29981	0	a	Or y
29982	0	a	yeah .
29983	1	a	Or something that has a a turning dial , where at the far end is on or off .
29984	0	a	Who is got an iPod then ?
29985	0	a	Yeah ,
29986	1	a	things like screen settings and audio settings , I would generally do them on the actual television itself , like here you have a you know , a little flap th with a little control panel on the actual box itself .
29987	0	a	Yeah ,
29988	0	a	I do not
29989	0	a	I wish .
29990	0	a	Anyway ,
29991	0	a	that was the only comment about some of the the decisions people have made , what is most important .
29992	0	a	Okay .
29993	0	a	It is definitely channel , volume , power .
29994	0	a	Exactly .
29995	0	a	Exactly .
29996	0	a	I I would not know how to do it using a remote control , so I would say that they are definitely less relevant .
29997	0	a	Yeah .
29998	0	a	Okay , well .
29999	0	a	Okay .
30000	0	a	Thanks for looking at that .
30001	0	a	So
30002	0	a	I guess easy to use is the other thing that we want them to be able to do .
30003	0	a	We do not want to outsmart
30004	0	a	As you said , you know , do not make it too hard for the granny .
30005	0	a	I just joined that set last week .
30006	0	a	first grandchild arrived .
30007	0	a	Congratulations .
30008	0	a	so are we agreed then of those things ?
30009	1	a	And let is go back to agenda and hook me up .
30010	0	a	D
30011	0	a	Oh
30012	0	a	you are fine .
30013	0	a	This oughta be fun .
30014	0	a	It probably wo not go the first time ,
30015	0	a	it will probably be like a g mess .
30016	0	a	Come on .
30017	0	a	it lost it off here .
30018	0	a	No ,
30019	0	a	it was up there , but I could not see it down here .
30020	0	a	It is fine .
30021	0	a	This time it should be both .
30022	0	a	There we go .
30023	0	a	How do you do that ?
30024	0	a	How do you make it do both ?
30025	0	a	okay ,
30026	0	a	it toggles through ,
30027	0	a	yeah .
30028	0	a	you have to keep doing the financi the the FN and F eight to five minutes to finish ,
30029	0	a	thank you a lot for telling me .
30030	1	a	I think you have to cycle through .
30031	0	a	right ,
30032	0	a	we are ready to close .
30033	0	a	Yeah .
30034	0	a	will be completed q questionnaire , then we will have some time for individual work to continue our research and I will put some minutes of this meeting together .
30035	0	a	your individual assignments are for Kate to do the components , for you , Steph , to do the user interface and for you the trend watching .
30036	0	a	and each of us will get help from our coach .
30037	0	a	Are we agreed to get ourselves together and then have lunch ?
30038	0	a	Okay .
30039	0	a	Yes .
30040	0	a	Sounds good .
30041	0	a	Then that is the end of this meeting .
30042	0	a	And I hope that is good enough for her to tell her that is the end .
30043	0	a	Okay ?
30044	0	a	Well
30045	0	a	I think I went over the functions and wrote them down and marked them .
30046	0	a	Okay .
30047	0	a	We did not come to any sort of decision on the functions though .
30048	0	a	Alright ,
30049	0	a	well
30050	0	a	that is fine then .
30051	0	a	that is what I went over and nobody was objecting to them .
30052	0	a	Okay .
30053	0	a	and you would mentioned I
30054	1	a	I was just going to say ,
30055	0	a	could you reiterate the new project requirements ,
30056	0	a	because it they were
30057	0	a	it has to be for a TV ,
30058	0	a	just to keep myself
30059	0	a	Yeah ,
30060	0	a	I think I have
30061	0	a	Okay .
30062	0	a	Okay .
30063	0	a	the teletext is outdated , the internet is important , it is only to be for a TV and it must include the corporate image , colour and slogan which I think is more in the user range , with Steph .
30064	0	a	So
30065	0	a	we are still in meeting ,
30066	0	a	are not we ?
30067	0	a	Sorry ,
30068	0	a	what what actually are these
30069	0	a	is that the yellow and black ?
30070	0	a	From their
30071	1	a	I will just use it from their website .
30072	0	a	It does not tell me .
30073	0	a	Right .
30074	0	a	 
30075	0	a	Hi Kate .
30076	1	a	Just just carry on .
30077	0	a	Okay , carry on .
30078	0	a	Alright
30079	0	a	this is the beginning of the third meeting , the conceptual design meeting .
30080	0	a	our agenda should be that we are opening the meeting ,
30081	0	a	I have
30082	0	a	the minutes from the previous meeting are on the shared f drive at this point .
30083	0	a	and we should each have a presentation to make .
30084	0	a	we have certain decisions to make and we have forty minutes total .
30085	0	a	It is twenty five after two at the moment , so forty minutes is five after three ,
30086	1	a	which I will be keeping an eye on the clock for us .
30087	0	a	Okay .
30088	0	a	there are the decisions we have to turn to ,
30089	1	a	but we will come back to them in a minute
30090	1	a	after I take us to the minutes of the previous meeting .
30091	0	a	Right
30092	0	a	as we remember , I opened the meeting , the four of us were present , the meeting the first meeting is minutes were reviewed and approved .
30093	0	a	Sarah , you presented a marketing research report which pretty much rep represented that fifteen to thirty five year olds it has to be hand held , power , channel , volume , number keys , possibly a speech recognition .
30094	0	a	And then Steph did a second presentation that those functions plus streamlining them with big user friendly keys that were easy to use .
30095	0	a	I think all of us agreed with those things .
30096	0	a	Kate presented a working design of going after going over the basics on the whiteboard that it should be a simple mass produced device , because of the twelve and a half Pence cost .
30097	0	a	but we did talk about possibly using rechargeable batteries and having a docking place as a selling point .
30098	0	a	and the new requirements that it for be for TV only and that it include the l so slogan and colour of the corporate design be included .
30099	0	a	the corporate image .
30100	0	a	So
30101	0	a	we agreed that the target market would be fifteen to thirty five with more money than sense , that were decision makers .
30102	0	a	Alternatively it would be a manufacturer to enclose it with the TV , but it still should meet those parameters .
30103	0	a	and that the function we agreed was volume , power , numbers , enter , channels , a way to move between channels , easy to use and hand held .
30104	0	a	at that point we agreed that Sarah would look at the current cost of competition , what what do the current ones sell for .
30105	0	a	and Steph was going to look at ec ergonomics .
30106	0	a	Kate was going to look at cost and feasibility of the various possibilities that we discussed .
30107	0	a	And I was to type up these minutes and work on the final report .
30108	0	a	Is this a fair presentation of what our last meeting was ?
30109	0	a	Okay .
30110	0	a	Yeah .
30111	0	a	Yes .
30112	0	a	Right .
30113	0	a	So
30114	1	a	we are ready to close that and go back to our That one .
30115	0	a	Right .
30116	0	a	We are up to the point of the
30117	1	a	Go back .
30118	1	a	the three presentations .
30119	1	a	So we are going to pull the plug on me
30120	1	a	and turn to Sarah .
30121	0	a	Is that okay ?
30122	0	a	Is that alright with everybody else ?
30123	0	a	Especially since Kate asked to be last .
30124	0	a	Yep .
30125	0	a	Sarah , I am sorry if I misspelled your name ,
30126	0	a	I did not know whether it was SARA or SARH .
30127	0	a	I respond to either .
30128	0	a	No worries .
30129	0	a	You respond to whatever you get , huh ?
30130	0	a	Okay .
30131	0	a	, did you do your Hit
30132	0	a	there it is .
30133	0	a	Yeah ,
30134	0	a	Right .
30135	0	a	Ta da .
30136	0	a	Okay ,
30137	1	a	first thing I want to address is one of the points that Florence brought up ,
30138	0	a	which was current cost of the competition devices , similar to the ones that Stephanie showed us and and they are twenty to sixty Euros , depending on branding .
30139	0	a	Some of them that have a higher brand recognition are on the more expensive end .
30140	0	a	But I think that with the current price that we are searching for , we are well within , even on the lower end , of the of the market .
30141	0	a	kay .
30142	1	a	But I am going to move on to more interesting more vibrant things .
30143	0	a	So ,
30144	0	a	I investigated the remote control market in greater detail , and my the theme of what I was to work on was trend watch .
30145	0	a	And
30146	0	a	I know that you all are a distance from cutting edge marketing research ,
30147	0	a	so you know ,
30148	1	a	I am just going to try to cloak it in really professional terms here .
30149	0	a	Kay .
30150	0	a	Sorry .
30151	0	a	I am glad to see the marketing budget is being so well spent on .
30152	0	a	What is hot ,
30153	0	a	fruit and veg .
30154	0	a	Spongy .
30155	0	a	And this is all over the catwalks , Paris , Milan , and I am talking about clothing , furniture , shoes .
30156	0	a	This is really interesting change from past years ,
30157	0	a	because it is much more organic , some would say approachable .
30158	1	a	And I think if we are to refashion our view of what we want in a remote control , we should perhaps think about incorporating technologically interesting fabrics and some of the bold colours into a simple handset .
30159	0	a	So .
30160	0	a	I also did a little research
30161	0	a	on what again are the most important priorities in decision making about purchasing .
30162	0	a	Fancy .
30163	0	a	Functional is out .
30164	0	a	And f the fancy , and that is exactly the term , I am I am thinking polished , elegant , you know , kind of innovative , but a cut above .
30165	0	a	This is twice as important as the next finding , which is technologically innovative .
30166	0	a	This is interesting ,
30167	0	a	cause I think in the last meeting we were talking about technology as being so important , but maybe what is innovative is having it simple with with technologically superior fabrics
30168	0	a	or , you know , designed in interesting substances .
30169	0	a	Ease of use .
30170	0	a	Again , pretty low , I mean it is the top three , but each of the fancy and technologically innovative are far more important .
30171	0	a	So
30172	1	a	I think we should cloak the streamlined remote control device in a series of fruit fruit themed sleeves .
30173	0	a	I think that is a good idea .
30174	0	a	Do not you ?
30175	0	a	Yeah ,
30176	0	a	I I think we are going to have some trouble when we get down to the component design on this .
30177	0	a	Y
30178	0	a	yeah ,
30179	0	a	you know
30180	0	a	Exactly .
30181	0	a	Yes .
30182	0	a	It sounds like the the covers that they use for the remote , you know , your t your cell phone .
30183	0	a	Exactly .
30184	1	a	I was thinking though that instead of having something like patterned , you know , so , you know , something similar to a summer dress .
30185	1	a	you know , it would have like fruit and veg ,
30186	1	a	is that we actually make these spongy .
30187	0	a	They could be ini
30188	1	a	initially I thought we could start with kind of fruit that would suit kind of a long hand held , so banana , pineapple and pear .
30189	1	a	it could actually the sleeve could take up a lot of the development and the remote control , we would just need to get reductionist on it .
30190	1	a	They could be interchangeable , they are spongy ,
30191	0	a	that goes back to ergonomic , and the youngsters love them , fun for the whole family , everyone can have their own .
30192	1	a	So what we are talking about is changing .
30193	1	a	this concept .
30194	0	a	Everyone has a TV remote ,
30195	1	a	but then we add in the fact that they could each have their own individual fruit .
30196	0	a	That is what is hot on the catwalks .
30197	0	a	So ,
30198	0	a	this is my
30199	0	a	This is what I am thinking .
30200	0	a	Uh huh .
30201	0	a	In most families , do not is not the remote is a remote .
30202	0	a	Y
30203	0	a	yeah ,
30204	0	a	but I think I think what this would allow is perhaps a person in the family who had the most opinion about it
30205	0	a	we all need a remote , but the person who is really perhaps active in personalising , I am thinking the teenager , the someone fifteen to thirty five would go out and get this additional thing the same way as you mentioned that people would get the cell phone covers .
30206	0	a	So when your dad is sitting there , overriding your decision , going no we are going to watch this , you can bring out your own remote and be like zap , no we are going to watch this .
30207	0	a	Yeah .
30208	0	a	W and plus I think
30209	0	a	yeah .
30210	0	a	Well
30211	0	a	actually some households do have three and four TVs and they would have a remote for each one ,
30212	0	a	so .
30213	0	a	Yeah .
30214	0	a	Yeah .
30215	0	a	So
30216	0	a	this is an idea
30217	0	a	and I
30218	0	a	I
30219	0	a	you know ,
30220	0	a	this is exactly what the research has has shown .
30221	0	a	So I really open this up to any other feedback .
30222	0	a	This spongy fruit and veg .
30223	0	a	Thanks .
30224	0	a	Alright .
30225	0	a	Yep .
30226	0	a	Spongy is going to be difficult , I am afraid .
30227	0	a	And as for as for well budgeting as well , if we are going to have lots of different interchangeable components .
30228	0	a	I I just have my ear to the market , guys .
30229	0	a	Is this to the market ?
30230	0	a	I was thinking titanium ,
30231	0	a	I was thinking it is just
30232	0	a	I have been influenced by pictures of iPods , and they are also minimalist and shiny .
30233	0	a	Yeah , I mean basically
30234	0	a	we can make these things out of wood , titanium , plastic or rubber .
30235	0	a	I suppose rubber is the closest to spongy ,
30236	0	a	yeah .
30237	0	a	Is spongiest , yeah .
30238	0	a	That would add
30239	1	a	I was thinking titanium myself .
30240	0	a	They are
30241	0	a	and they they would fulfil the first priority , which is fancy .
30242	0	a	I think many of us would associate those with fancy .
30243	1	a	Something else we could do is call it something that is fruit and veg oriented .
30244	1	a	We could call it The name .
30245	0	a	Are we talking about the device itself or the c or a cover for the device that would be an interchangeable cov cover as a separate product ?
30246	1	a	Perhaps perhaps that desi that particular suggestion needs to go back to management and perhaps go to another group to actually design as a separate product .
30247	0	a	Well
30248	1	a	it would be a a very simple product that would have a spongy sleeve that would be interchangeable .
30249	1	a	So
30250	0	a	That , you know , that might be
30251	1	a	And then we could keep it titanium .
30252	0	a	Yeah ,
30253	0	a	but it is kind of pointless ,
30254	0	a	is not it ?
30255	0	a	Yeah .
30256	1	a	Let is delegate .
30257	0	a	Wo would that be agreeable ?
30258	1	a	Do you want to be next or you want Kate to go next ?
30259	0	a	Okay ,
30260	1	a	we will move the
30261	0	a	Yeah .
30262	0	a	W w would it be helpful if I described the components a bit ,
30263	0	a	because I think it would give you maybe bring this discussion back to Earth of what we can actually physically do .
30264	0	a	Yeah , maybe .
30265	0	a	Or
30266	1	a	I think possibly it might be more useful if Kate went next .
30267	1	a	You can even have them in different flavours as well .
30268	1	a	So that if you just want to sit there and chew on the remote , it could be like pear flavour ,
30269	0	a	yeah .
30270	0	a	Yeah .
30271	1	a	Or s or smelly .
30272	1	a	Scratchy
30273	0	a	well
30274	1	a	I was really thinking a lot about the I the iMac kind of gel gem tone .
30275	0	a	Scratch and sniff .
30276	0	a	It is hot on the streets , guys .
30277	0	a	Right , well
30278	0	a	I
30279	0	a	I
30280	0	a	I think some of this
30281	0	a	you are going to be a little disappointed with some of the things I have to tell you , but I am afraid this is the real world .
30282	0	a	So
30283	0	a	I have been looking at the the basics of how these devices actually have to work in order to operate , and I have had some discussions with the ma manufacturing division , who have told me what is actually available , you know , what the current state of the art in components is , and some of the exciting new things they have got , but I am not sure that it is quite what you want
30284	0	a	Now
30285	0	a	this is not a very good overhead ,
30286	0	a	but this is just to show you , this is the innards of a remote control .
30287	0	a	I really need a pen or something
30288	0	a	but
30289	0	a	does my mouse work ?
30290	0	a	No .
30291	0	a	oh
30292	0	a	yeah ,
30293	0	a	can you see my little mouse pointer ?
30294	0	a	Right .
30295	0	a	This is this is the a a a remote that is been opened up and that is the the back of the interface .
30296	0	a	And this is a push button one , so you see these little little buttons here , they are little rubber rubber buttons that go through onto the the board at the back and they push these buttons here .
30297	0	a	and we
30298	0	a	that is the basic construction that we have got to got to accommodate .
30299	0	a	We got to have something that pushes the little buttons that talk to the chip that encodes the message that sends the the message to the receiver .
30300	0	a	So
30301	1	a	I wan I want to go through not not just addressing the the the points that you made , Sarah , but doing my presentation in the order I wrote it .
30302	1	a	So first of all I want to talk about what possibilities we have got for the energy source .
30303	0	a	we can have your bog standard double double A batteries in a replaceable little compartment .
30304	0	a	We can have a hand
30305	0	a	sorry
30306	0	a	a wind up , yeah ,
30307	0	a	which I think is quite an interesting concept for a sorry for a remote control , but i it maybe is does not quite go with the the fruit and veg .
30308	0	a	A wind up .
30309	0	a	one that one that I think is quite interesting is the kinetic energy source ,
30310	0	a	where you you actually get the energy by moving the device ,
30311	0	a	which is quite a ni a nice and neat one .
30312	0	a	Alright .
30313	1	a	Remember ,
30314	0	a	we only have forty minutes
30315	0	a	You have to
30316	0	a	it means that if it is sitting there for a long time it probably wo not work ,
30317	1	a	but you have to sort of throw it between your hands every now and then ,
30318	0	a	it will work .
30319	0	a	Or we we had talked about solar power ,
30320	0	a	but I thing that we agreed that that is not so good in the dark .
30321	0	a	Now
30322	0	a	I am afraid this is the options we have got on on the case .
30323	0	a	It can be made of plastic , rubber , wood o if you like , or titanium .
30324	0	a	and the nearest we have got to st to spongy there
30325	0	a	I guess is rubber ,
30326	1	a	but I am going to come back to the advantages of titanium ,
30327	0	a	and basically it can have a flat surface , a curved surface or a double curved surface , but I think if we want to use standard components , we are going to have difficulty with anything much beyond that .
30328	0	a	Okay ,
30329	0	a	what does the interface look like ?
30330	0	a	well
30331	0	a	push button , that is that is the one we are all familiar with .
30332	0	a	we can have scroll buttons and the the scroll button can incorporate a push , so you can have it like on a mouse where you can use it to go up and down , change volume or channel or something like that and push to select something .
30333	0	a	you can have multiple scroll buttons ,
30334	0	a	this is maybe getting a little bit complicated ,
30335	0	a	but it is it the technology is there .
30336	0	a	And we can also incorporate an LCD display in the remote , but this will increase the cost .
30337	0	a	the electronics that actually makes the device work , we have basically got three , simple , regular , advanced , and the price goes up as we choose each of this .
30338	0	a	If we want the nice cheap one , the simple , then we can only have push buttons .
30339	0	a	All the other fancy interface designs go out the window , I am afraid .
30340	0	a	pay a little bit more for a regular chip and you can have scroll buttons .
30341	0	a	If you want the advanced chip it obviously costs more , but it that is what you need if you want the LCD display .
30342	0	a	And the manufacturing devision tell me that they have recently developed sample sensor sample speaker devices .
30343	0	a	Now
30344	0	a	I do not know what that is ,
30345	0	a	but I think they think it is quite important
30346	1	a	and we might want to incorporate it somewhere .
30347	0	a	ou our real expertise is in push buttons , I have to say , but maybe you think that is old technology .
30348	0	a	And well
30349	0	a	I I think we have got two options .
30350	1	a	We can either go for a really cheap model , keep all of the costs down ,
30351	0	a	which means a flat plastic case with an ordinary battery and simple push buttons .
30352	1	a	Or we can have something that looks a bit nicer , I think it , wo not necessarily l look like a pineapple ,
30353	0	a	but that may or may not be a good thing .
30354	0	a	Sorry .
30355	1	a	but it could have an LCD screen and it could have multiple scroll buttons , and it could have the the company is new development of the sample sensor and speaker .
30356	0	a	So ,
30357	0	a	thank you .
30358	0	a	That sounds good .
30359	0	a	Any idea you
30360	0	a	you mentioned that there would be a cost difference .
30361	0	a	do you have any idea if if this could if the fancy model could be done in twelve Euros fifty ?
30362	0	a	Yeah ,
30363	0	a	I am afraid I do not have that information available .
30364	0	a	manufacturing did not actually give attach any prices to any of this , I am afraid .
30365	0	a	Because , you know what , I am being quite serious when I say that that the things I mentioned are hot .
30366	0	a	But I think the important thing might be to choose one .
30367	1	a	You know , if if what you are telling me is is some of these things are not just f are not feasible , maybe we could something about naming , we could call it , you know , Blackberry .
30368	0	a	Yeah .
30369	0	a	That is
30370	0	a	Alright ,
30371	0	a	well
30372	0	a	let is see then .
30373	0	a	Bear bear in mind it has to be the colours and styles of the company ,
30374	1	a	so what I had been thinking was something chunky and yellow and plastic with black buttons with a logo on it .
30375	0	a	Banana ?
30376	1	a	We we could we could do a double curved rubber one ,
30377	0	a	which would allow say a banana , but unfortunately I see from my notes that if we do that , we have to have a push button as the interface , we ca not do anything fancier .
30378	0	a	But
30379	0	a	I I do not know how important that is to keep it exactly the colours of the Real Reaction company .
30380	0	a	Yeah .
30381	0	a	It is just what I would understood we would be doing .
30382	0	a	Yeah .
30383	0	a	That is before I heard about all this hot tips about the future , fruit wise .
30384	0	a	But yeah ,
30385	1	a	I am trying to streamline mine a little bit .
30386	0	a	Yeah .
30387	0	a	Shall we wait until I have until I have showed you what well , my extensive presentation on what sort of interfaces are available .
30388	0	a	Yeah .
30389	0	a	Yep .
30390	0	a	Thank you , Kate .
30391	0	a	Thank you , Kate .
30392	0	a	You did seem to include just in more detail what I have got though .
30393	0	a	So so mine is a bit pointless .
30394	0	a	Right .
30395	0	a	FN and F eight , did you say ?
30396	0	a	I do not have it on mine though .
30397	0	a	Yes .
30398	0	a	There we go .
30399	0	a	Oh
30400	0	a	I think Florence resolved it by
30401	1	a	F eight again .
30402	1	a	I If you do F FN F eight again , it is it will
30403	0	a	I think it
30404	0	a	yeah , you you will do an
30405	1	a	Do it again .
30406	1	a	Keep doing it until you get it in both
30407	0	a	you get it there , you get it yours without that one , and then you get it with both .
30408	0	a	Should I do it again ?
30409	0	a	Right then .
30410	0	a	Maybe .
30411	0	a	Yeah .
30412	0	a	This time it should come up both .
30413	0	a	I do not actually have a huge amount of different information then what Kate says , just that my method was to look at the , well , my my inspirations , which was a big collection of lots of different models of remote controls and other things that use a similar sort of thing , including MP three players , like you know , hi fi remotes , not just television and these things .
30414	0	a	Okay .
30415	0	a	having a think about the feature of ea the features of each ones , what functions we actually need , and then how to group and arrange these on the actual the actual plastic or rubber hand held piece .
30416	0	a	I have been especially interested in the iPod style scroll wheel ,
30417	0	a	which
30418	0	a	Well ,
30419	0	a	I could not find a
30420	0	a	the picture of the iPod w only linked to a web browser , so I could not copy and paste it , but it had a similar thing to this thing on the right .
30421	0	a	It has scroll wheels without without a display , but they they scroll like a computer mouse .
30422	1	a	So I was thinking that a really simple a really simple interface with just a couple of scroll things on it and then instead of a display the display could appear on the television screen .
30423	0	a	Like I guess an existing Sky or cable one does .
30424	0	a	Like , you know ,
30425	0	a	you press enter and it comes up with what is showing on that channel at the moment ,
30426	0	a	and you can do
30427	0	a	you can scroll along and it will show you what is on in the next half hour , and you scroll up and you can see what is on the other channels while you are watching the same channel on the screen .
30428	0	a	but I am also equally taken with this chunky plastic kiddie remote , which is really nice and fun and good to hold and nice , big , easy buttons to press ,
30429	0	a	but still quite simple and quite cost effective .
30430	0	a	So
30431	1	a	what seems kind of ideal for me would be to just have a fairly simple , not fancy but not totally minimalist ,
30432	1	a	I mean just pretty simple plastic , probably , I was thinking , yellow and black ,
30433	0	a	just because that is the company is colours ,
30434	1	a	with very very few buttons , but that would correspond to a screen that would appear on the television screen , like , you know , just small along the bottom
30435	0	a	instead of instead of having the iPod style display screen on the actual remotes , which is far too expensive .
30436	1	a	And when you have got a screen sitting there in front of you , you might as well have it appearing on the screen in front of you ,
30437	0	a	it does not obscure much of the actual picture you are watching .
30438	0	a	Yeah .
30439	0	a	And so on that you can , just much in the same way as an existing Sky remote , scroll along , scroll up and down .
30440	0	a	Yeah , I would I would certainly support that idea .
30441	0	a	And and I definitely support the use of plastic and or rubber .
30442	0	a	I mean titanium would be great , but I think it might be a bit too expensive and too kind of spacey .
30443	0	a	If we are k trying to keep it colourful and slightly organic , then I think titanium is too futuristic .
30444	0	a	It is difficult to make fancy shapes in it as well , we ca not for example have a double curved case in titanium unfortunately .
30445	0	a	Yeah .
30446	0	a	Whereas a plastic is so cheap and easy and mouldable and everything else .
30447	0	a	then
30448	0	a	And it is a little bit pointless as well I think .
30449	0	a	And the the having the the the screen on the television screen I think is a good idea ,
30450	0	a	cause otherwise we are we are putting up the price not only for putting building the LCD in , but for the electronics as well .
30451	0	a	It is a duplication .
30452	0	a	Like
30453	1	a	when when when you have got when you have got the screen there , it does not have to be anything fancy ,
30454	0	a	just a little menu showing
30455	0	a	yeah ,
30456	1	a	a menu , you go into one menu and then it can have your different options , whether you want to change the settings or
30457	1	a	the you know , your information about programme that is on at the moment .
30458	0	a	There is that .
30459	0	a	I do not think that is to taxing to s engineer .
30460	1	a	But as for actually arranging them let me go back to the to the picture of the kiddie one .
30461	0	a	And I quite like it ,
30462	0	a	cause it is just smooth and hand held and it is got these easily reachable buttons that quite nicely spaced out ,
30463	1	a	so something a bit like that with buttons arranged in a kind of circle .
30464	1	a	Up , down , left , right .
30465	0	a	Do you want scroll buttons in that as well ?
30466	0	a	I I was thinking not actually scroll , like a like mouse scroll ,
30467	0	a	but you know , a
30468	0	a	I ca not quite d describe it .
30469	1	a	you see on the one on the right , down at the bottom , is the mouse .
30470	0	a	Yeah ,
30471	0	a	see where the mouse is ,
30472	1	a	like this s style thing where you c have up , down , left and right .
30473	0	a	Right .
30474	1	a	And enter in the middle , so you pick your menu and then your different options and when when you click on each one , it you can go into a new menu for that .
30475	0	a	I am getting a bit specific here .
30476	1	a	Really we would have to use something to show you ,
30477	0	a	but If
30478	0	a	I do not think I can get it up on the screen .
30479	0	a	Yeah .
30480	0	a	I think I think that is a g nice clean design ,
30481	0	a	it is playing to our strengths which are in push button technology .
30482	0	a	To m make it .
30483	0	a	here we go .
30484	0	a	Right .
30485	0	a	Oh
30486	0	a	nice .
30487	0	a	Well ,
30488	0	a	the iPod spinning wheel is really complicated .
30489	0	a	Huh .
30490	0	a	It does scroll ,
30491	0	a	but it is hugely complicated .
30492	0	a	Yeah .
30493	0	a	What else have we got ?
30494	0	a	Them , they are terrible .
30495	0	a	Wow .
30496	0	a	But they all have this this feature of this
30497	0	a	It is not quite a scroll wheel , but it is a kind of selection in this circle ,
30498	0	a	which I think is a really good idea .
30499	0	a	It is a selection wheel .
30500	1	a	But we can implement it with simple push buttons ,
30501	0	a	which is much cheaper .
30502	0	a	Yeah ,
30503	1	a	like up , down , left and right .
30504	0	a	Which is good .
30505	0	a	And then and then
30506	0	a	Yeah , so I mean
30507	1	a	either a channel up and down , volume up and down , next appearing programmes up and down , and then also when you get into the different menus on the screen , it is got your things like settings and contrast up and down .
30508	0	a	Okay .
30509	0	a	So all you really need is these four buttons with the enter in the middle .
30510	0	a	Okay .
30511	0	a	And that is it .
30512	0	a	In fact
30513	0	a	Oh
30514	0	a	that is really nice .
30515	1	a	Look at look at this one .
30516	0	a	Almost impossible to misplace or l or lose .
30517	0	a	Do you think with
30518	0	a	It seems that that you guys are quite keen on the plastic , perhaps the something reminiscent of the child is remote .
30519	0	a	Might take up your whole living room .
30520	0	a	Do you think we could put it in a in a fruit colour ?
30521	0	a	And have it abstract .
30522	0	a	You know ,
30523	1	a	we could call like a fruit name , but it would be a little more abstract .
30524	0	a	Possibly .
30525	0	a	Yeah .
30526	0	a	That also is possible .
30527	1	a	We we could actually do it in rubber instead of plastic if you would rather if you feel if you like the spongy
30528	0	a	I am just just throwing out ideas .
30529	0	a	Just
30530	1	a	just something else I need to bring to your attention
30531	0	a	is have you have you seen these on a remote ?
30532	0	a	This is actually the volume up and down , but they both say V on them , which , when you first look at it , you expect that to be the down , because it looks like a downward pointing arrow , but it is actually the V to indicate that it is the volume ,
30533	1	a	so we do need to avoid little ambiguities like these .
30534	1	a	Or call it a or call it a banana and have it in yellow .
30535	0	a	Yeah .
30536	1	a	I am thinking maybe we need to be a little bit more abstract if the design constraints are so
30537	0	a	Okay .
30538	0	a	Yeah .
30539	0	a	Yeah .
30540	0	a	Yeah .
30541	0	a	Nice .
30542	0	a	Good point .
30543	1	a	But we would not have a specific volume up and down .
30544	1	a	If we are having the scroll wheel , then it is going to double up as all the other up and down functions .
30545	0	a	kay .
30546	0	a	But then , that is complicated .
30547	0	a	I want to thank you all for all your presentations .
30548	0	a	We have about ten minutes left ,
30549	1	a	in which time we have to make some decisions on the remote control concepts .
30550	0	a	and I think you all have been self stimulating of working together .
30551	1	a	we need to come up with some specifics of the components , the materials , things like making the decision on the energy and the case and the interface type things .
30552	0	a	So
30553	0	a	let is
30554	0	a	Right .
30555	0	a	They want us to decide what form of energy are we going to use , which the choices that we have discussed were pretty much battery , kinetic or solar .
30556	0	a	this is where Kate is expertise comes in ,
30557	1	a	and our decision making will be a little bit guided by Kate at this point .
30558	0	a	The
30559	0	a	You were saying that the kinetic would be useful , that is you just have to move it some
30560	0	a	and you would be able to use it as opposed to a battery that you have to either put it in a recharger or keep replacing the batteries .
30561	0	a	or solar that you would have difficulty with it if it is a dark day , that it will die on you , and no way to do it .
30562	0	a	That is the day you want to use the TV .
30563	0	a	so what is our pleasure here , what would be the cost consequences of each of the three ?
30564	0	a	Okay .
30565	0	a	Oh
30566	0	a	unfortunately I do not have costing information .
30567	0	a	I i in terms of workability , I I think the the two front runners are the standard battery or the kinetic ,
30568	0	a	but I am sorry
30569	0	a	I do not figures on the difference in cost .
30570	0	a	kay .
30571	0	a	What is the feelings of the group on the kinetic ?
30572	0	a	I have used kinetic in terms of watches
30573	0	a	and it is very very handy ,
30574	0	a	you do not even notice that it is there .
30575	0	a	It sounds great .
30576	0	a	I have never come across it before ,
30577	0	a	but it sounds fantastic .
30578	0	a	Sounds like it could be g a really good economical it would make the whole thing a lot lighter , more convenient .
30579	0	a	It is
30580	1	a	It could tie in with the fanciful design
30581	0	a	as
30582	0	a	, you know ,
30583	1	a	throw the banana , you know , just gotta keep it moving .
30584	0	a	Yeah .
30585	0	a	Cause it is really a quite attractive thought ,
30586	0	a	is not it ?
30587	0	a	It is like
30588	0	a	yeah ,
30589	0	a	a good selling point .
30590	0	a	So the consensus seems to be use the kinetic if it is at all possible .
30591	0	a	Be
30592	0	a	Yeah .
30593	0	a	But it does depend how much I mean how much it costs and how much more development and research it needs .
30594	0	a	It costs .
30595	0	a	And and how much you do have to keep it moving ,
30596	0	a	cause I am conscious that watching TV can be quite a sed sedentary activity .
30597	0	a	Yeah .
30598	1	a	But I could market that as a as a a I was thinking actually a a cost saver down the road , in terms of battery , you know .
30599	1	a	Do your exercises while you are watching the TV .
30600	0	a	Yeah .
30601	0	a	True , yeah ,
30602	1	a	m more more environmentally friendly .
30603	0	a	Yeah , that is what I was thinking as well .
30604	0	a	Yeah .
30605	0	a	You know ,
30606	0	a	kind of the
30607	0	a	That is exactly what I was thinking .
30608	0	a	Thanks for the reminder for five minutes to finish , thanks .
30609	1	a	the next thing that they wanted us to do was look at chip on print as a decision .
30610	0	a	Oh right , okay ,
30611	0	a	I would
30612	1	a	that that is something I maybe should have covered .
30613	0	a	chip on print is just a manufacturing technique
30614	1	a	and I would certainly recommend it , I think ,
30615	0	a	because I am not sure I have an alternative .
30616	0	a	Oh .
30617	0	a	Okay .
30618	0	a	I i it
30619	0	a	it is just the way that the the the th the way it is ac it is actually built and
30620	0	a	you you print onto the circuit board like you might print onto paper .
30621	0	a	What about the ca
30622	0	a	yeah .
30623	0	a	Oh ,
30624	0	a	the way we
30625	0	a	uh huh .
30626	0	a	Oh , okay .
30627	1	a	what about the case ?
30628	0	a	I think they are talking there about do we want wood , plastic , titanium or rubber , and I think we have discussed not having titanium .
30629	0	a	One , it is too expensive , and second , it wo not do this double curves .
30630	0	a	we have sort of eliminated wood .
30631	0	a	We said plastic or rubber .
30632	1	a	What is the pleasure ?
30633	0	a	What about you ?
30634	0	a	Cover .
30635	0	a	Well
30636	0	a	if if Sarah is keen on a spongy feel , the the rubber that we are talking about is the same as you have in those little stress balls ,
30637	0	a	so it is
30638	0	a	yeah .
30639	0	a	I am sold .
30640	0	a	Do you not think it might need like a kind of a hard plastic inner shell with the actual delicate workings inside , and then a kind of spongy
30641	0	a	Yeah , s thick spongy cover ,
30642	0	a	so it feels like the whole thing is spongy , but actually you are not damaging anything by squeezing it .
30643	0	a	Kind of like an internal egg .
30644	0	a	Plastic inside .
30645	0	a	Yeah .
30646	0	a	Because I mean you could just get carried away with the with the tac
30647	0	a	Yeah .
30648	0	a	Yeah .
30649	1	a	I would I would need to talk to manufacturing again about whether that is actually possible ,
30650	0	a	but I agree , it is sounds like a nice idea if it is .
30651	0	a	Well
30652	0	a	you do get a bit carried away with things that are tactile , you just want to stroke them and squeeze them ,
30653	0	a	and
30654	1	a	Just copy the one on the left .
30655	0	a	And with sports on television .
30656	0	a	Okay .
30657	0	a	You know .
30658	1	a	the next part they want is the user interface concept .
30659	0	a	I su
30660	0	a	Then I will just say I support either from a marketing point of view I support either decision that the designers make on that .
30661	0	a	I should I should r
30662	0	a	Which I think technically is just push button
30663	0	a	and I would certainly support that that
30664	0	a	that brings the cost down quite a lot and it is something that we are an ex the company is an expert on .
30665	0	a	I am sorry to push you ,
30666	0	a	but we only have a couple minutes to finish with .
30667	0	a	Okay ,
30668	1	a	and it says interface .
30669	1	a	What type and what supplements ?
30670	0	a	Okay ,
30671	0	a	that is that .
30672	0	a	No
30673	0	a	a scroll
30674	0	a	Well ,
30675	1	a	like four buttons , up , down , left and right with enter in the middle , that will correspond to a menu on the screen .
30676	0	a	Yeah ,
30677	0	a	I would like push buttons with
30678	0	a	So
30679	1	a	push buttons
30680	0	a	No ,
30681	0	a	it is still it is still plugged in on mine actually .
30682	0	a	this is going to sound weird ,
30683	0	a	but the next meeting starts in thirty minutes .
30684	0	a	Whew .
30685	0	a	And they actually want a look and feel design , user interface design , you can look and see this as well as I can .
30686	0	a	Marketing they want product evaluation .
30687	0	a	No we ca not , actually .
30688	0	a	Oh .
30689	0	a	Oh my , I am sorry .
30690	0	a	That is why I was looking over your shoulder
30691	0	a	Oh , okay .
30692	0	a	Sorry about that .
30693	0	a	missed that one .
30694	0	a	This ought to be fun trying to get this thing to work .
30695	0	a	, ta da .
30696	0	a	Now it is gone again .
30697	0	a	You know ,
30698	0	a	Yes ,
30699	0	a	because I ca not even see mine .
30700	0	a	Next meeting starts in thirty minutes , these are the individual actions .
30701	0	a	Oh yes .
30702	0	a	Yeah , right .
30703	0	a	the look and feel design is for Kate , Steph gets the user interface design , you get product evaluation .
30704	0	a	the two of you get to play with a Pla modelling clay to do a prototype .
30705	0	a	Great .
30706	0	a	and everybody gets individual instructions in the usual way .
30707	0	a	Sounds good .
30708	0	a	Anything else we need to do ?
30709	1	a	Go to it .
30710	0	a	I do not think so .
30711	0	a	And that is the end of this meeting .
30712	0	a	 
30713	0	a	almost , there is one more thing I have to get out of the
30714	0	a	I have to make sure that this attachment will open .
30715	0	a	I keep forgetting whether I have done this .
30716	0	a	Ah ha .
30717	0	a	Okay .
30718	1	a	We will open that when the time is right .
30719	0	a	In the meantime
30720	0	a	Closing things down ,
30721	0	a	okay .
30722	1	a	Let is see what this thing does .
30723	0	a	Does it come up together or disappear one of them or what ?
30724	0	a	we came up together ,
30725	0	a	we are good .
30726	0	a	Okay .
30727	0	a	Are we ready to start ?
30728	0	a	Okay .
30729	0	a	It is now quarter of four .
30730	0	a	This is a f another forty minute one
30731	1	a	so it will end at four twenty five .
30732	0	a	Okay .
30733	0	a	Right .
30734	0	a	Our agenda is , as before , for me to open the meeting , for us to go over the previous minutes , then for the two of you to present your prototype and for you to g
30735	0	a	Sarah present the evaluation criteria .
30736	0	a	We then have a finance aspect , which is a spreadsheet , an Excel spreadsheet .
30737	0	a	And I know what you are all thinking of , oh my , because we are only given a forty minute time period to get it all in , including the production evaluation .
30738	1	a	So we are going to make a very fast track .
30739	0	a	Okay .
30740	0	a	and as you can see that is what we do next on this thing .
30741	1	a	So the first thing I have to do is close this
30742	0	a	so that I can get to
30743	0	a	Where is it ?
30744	0	a	I need to open mine .
30745	1	a	Red .
30746	0	a	Not the agenda .
30747	0	a	Agenda three .
30748	0	a	No
30749	0	a	that th
30750	0	a	I want the minutes from the previous minutes .
30751	0	a	That should be there , minutes .
30752	0	a	Yeah .
30753	0	a	Okay .
30754	0	a	from meeting three ,
30755	0	a	is it alright with you if I do not switch it to show , just use it as is ?
30756	0	a	Cause this way I can more easily flip it .
30757	0	a	Okay ,
30758	0	a	obviously all of us were here for the last meeting , we reviewed the previous minutes before that , each of you made your presentations .
30759	0	a	we discussed the various possibilities based on what was presented in those presentations .
30760	0	a	The market trend of fruit and veg , spongy , fancy and elegant more than technologically innovative and that more than easy .
30761	0	a	we decided chip on print would be used .
30762	0	a	we would use plastic with a rubber casing , I think was the consensus , powered by kinetic energy .
30763	0	a	There was no decision made on the curvatures or double curvature or straight .
30764	0	a	perhaps the prototype will give us an inkling of that .
30765	0	a	looking like a scroll , but it is really a push button technology , excuse my spelling that was actually in use , that is behind the scenes is push button which we according to Kate have a very good grasp on doing that in production .
30766	0	a	we decided that separate fashionable covers covering your fruit and veg might be a separate product that could be suggested to management .
30767	0	a	and as suggested yellow with black buttons with the company logo , a slogan and image might be a good idea based on the requirements that have been provided to us .
30768	0	a	we did have a few production issues and coordination of the various bits and we had some conflict of ideas and cost constraints and we ran out of time .
30769	0	a	we had to follow that up and prepare for the last one .
30770	0	a	And we closed as it ran out of time .
30771	0	a	Is that a fair presentation of what happened ?
30772	0	a	Okay ,
30773	1	a	back to this meeting .
30774	0	a	Yes .
30775	0	a	Yep .
30776	0	a	we are down to the prototype presentation .
30777	0	a	Ta da .
30778	0	a	Alright .
30779	1	a	Over to you .
30780	0	a	Right .
30781	0	a	Well .
30782	0	a	Ooh ,
30783	0	a	two .
30784	0	a	Yeah ,
30785	0	a	well you see ,
30786	0	a	each made one , we did not have enough yellow dough .
30787	0	a	This is the one that I made .
30788	0	a	Uh huh .
30789	0	a	It is curved , easy to hold , hand held , nice and small with big easy buttons .
30790	0	a	This is like a scroll , but they are push buttons and they enter takes you into the different menus .
30791	1	a	Of course we need someone who is experienced with the television .
30792	0	a	I mean this is the infrared thing that is going to zap at the television .
30793	0	a	I am not quite sure how to make that , but I am sure it will work .
30794	0	a	this is on off switch ,
30795	1	a	cause I think we do need that ,
30796	0	a	and I think it gives it a nice balance .
30797	1	a	And it is going to have the logo imprinted on it in there .
30798	0	a	Kay .
30799	0	a	Okay .
30800	0	a	as for what it is actually made of
30801	0	a	well
30802	0	a	the function of these buttons is up , down , left and right in the different menus .
30803	0	a	Okay .
30804	0	a	position , I presume that just means right right on it , easy to see .
30805	0	a	The main feature of it is just a simple design , simple , lack of buttons all over the place .
30806	0	a	Right ?
30807	0	a	Form curved , kind of smooth , hand held ,
30808	0	a	makes it feel nice to hold .
30809	0	a	material , I think Kate is going to tackle that quite a bit , but I think we have two different options , because we did make a another one , which wa is in the shape of banana ,
30810	0	a	it is just
30811	1	a	if you can imagine this as yellow with black buttons , like just like this but in the shape of a banana ,
30812	0	a	which is also nice and easy to hold and feels good
30813	0	a	and has a similar sort of scroll push button technology , just a slightly different design .
30814	0	a	Also with on off switch and infrared
30815	1	a	I had envisioned it in hard smooth plastic .
30816	0	a	So like well ,
30817	0	a	I dunno ,
30818	0	a	what is it like ?
30819	0	a	I guess like an existing remote control , but molded and smooth .
30820	0	a	Whereas otherwise we would thought , like with this one
30821	1	a	or mix and match ,
30822	0	a	just we were going to see what you thought ,
30823	0	a	the
30824	1	a	a more spongy rubber cover with spongy buttons .
30825	0	a	So
30826	0	a	we have the two options we can follow , either the smooth hard plastic or the spongy rubber , depending on cost restraints .
30827	0	a	And what we
30828	0	a	well ,
30829	0	a	what conclusion we reach when we discuss it .
30830	0	a	material
30831	0	a	yeah ,
30832	0	a	that is what I have to say about material .
30833	0	a	Can I scroll down on there and see what else
30834	0	a	Well
30835	0	a	colour , I think I definitely have a preference towards bright yellow with black buttons ,
30836	0	a	because that is the company colours ,
30837	1	a	but if anybody is got any other suggestions , I am quite willing to consider them as well .
30838	0	a	So ,
30839	0	a	it just depends what you think about these ideas
30840	0	a	and if I am
30841	0	a	yeah ,
30842	0	a	maybe , Kate , you better say what you think about them .
30843	0	a	well
30844	0	a	I do not have very much to add .
30845	0	a	the the case
30846	0	a	oops ,
30847	0	a	that is the on off button just come off our prototype .
30848	1	a	The the case can be either spongy rubber or hard plastic .
30849	0	a	We are not absolutely sure about a combination of the two , but it can be either of those .
30850	0	a	We have the technology to do that .
30851	0	a	and as for the the actual components , Steph just said this is a quite a cheap device to manufacture .
30852	0	a	We have simple rubber push buttons which provide all the functionality we need .
30853	0	a	the the diode that actually does the infrared is at the end , it is the stalk of the banana , or it is just the thing at the end of this version .
30854	0	a	so
30855	0	a	that is for material .
30856	0	a	Colour , well Steph is the expert on colour .
30857	0	a	we we do not have any particular restrictions on that .
30858	0	a	Yeah ,
30859	0	a	I think that is all we have got to say really .
30860	0	a	I thin as for as for the fruit or organic theme , I guess this one is obviously fruit shaped .
30861	0	a	This one has n
30862	0	a	banana ,
30863	0	a	yeah .
30864	0	a	A banana .
30865	0	a	This one has no obvious connections to fruit , but because it is round and molded , it kind of makes you think sort of organic , touchy feely , kiddie ,
30866	0	a	it is more like
30867	0	a	yeah ,
30868	0	a	you would expect it to be like a child is sorta toy remote control instead of a real one ,
30869	0	a	which I quite like that sort of image .
30870	0	a	Cause it is very big and chunky and child friendly
30871	0	a	and
30872	0	a	Hold them ,
30873	0	a	you see , you know .
30874	0	a	Would you care to examine the prototypes , see how they feel in the hand ?
30875	0	a	Yes ,
30876	0	a	that is so that your index finger automatically goes straight to it .
30877	0	a	Curvature , is it to your liking ?
30878	0	a	If you do not want to tire out your thumbs after all .
30879	0	a	Oh I see , the on off is in the back .
30880	0	a	And then you can use your thumb .
30881	0	a	And it was partly we thought the design looked better ,
30882	0	a	Yeah .
30883	0	a	I could see this thing , unless it is reinforced , having a problem with the
30884	0	a	you know
30885	0	a	yeah .
30886	0	a	Breaking ,
30887	0	a	oh right .
30888	0	a	Well you see ,
30889	0	a	that is why hard plastic would be quite a good thing for it ,
30890	0	a	because then it would just be rigid .
30891	0	a	I like the fact that on both of them the keys play such a prominent role .
30892	0	a	It is really kind of a
30893	0	a	Yeah , we really like we really like that design ,
30894	0	a	I mean it looks just like a logo , that arrangement of the keys .
30895	0	a	Like a c like a compass point ,
30896	0	a	you know ,
30897	0	a	just up , down , left and right ,
30898	0	a	and we think we could make that quite a good feature .
30899	0	a	And it is like the the iPod scroll wheel , but better .
30900	0	a	Yeah .
30901	0	a	But it is also like texting ,
30902	0	a	you do not
30903	0	a	Yeah .
30904	0	a	Yeah .
30905	0	a	Yeah , yeah ,
30906	0	a	I mean it
30907	0	a	that is what it makes me think of , mobile phones ,
30908	0	a	I was try
30909	0	a	I was thinking , moving your thumb like this , what does that remind me of ?
30910	0	a	It is texting .
30911	0	a	And it is a very simple design , there is not a lot to wrong , the components are cheap to make .
30912	0	a	It is also in terms of being lost it is
30913	0	a	it is quite it looks quite different .
30914	0	a	You know ,
30915	0	a	I
30916	0	a	I
30917	0	a	d I have several four remotes , and they all look the same until you get up close
30918	0	a	and you have to
30919	0	a	you know ,
30920	0	a	this is really identifiable .
30921	0	a	Yeah .
30922	0	a	I mean the thing is we do need to develop our technology of I mean actually how to program the menus and what sort of , you know , text box is going to appear at the bottom of the screen ,
30923	0	a	but we do definitely think that it is a viable option .
30924	0	a	Okay .
30925	1	a	The next item is evaluation .
30926	0	a	No , okay .
30927	0	a	if that is
30928	0	a	if you are finished .
30929	0	a	shall I take your power ?
30930	0	a	Oh .
30931	0	a	yeah , we are finished .
30932	0	a	Oh sorry .
30933	1	a	Try again .
30934	0	a	Okay .
30935	0	a	This is going to be a heavily interactive evaluation , and the method here is to evaluate the new remote control in terms of the user requirements and the hot trends introduced by the marketing department .
30936	0	a	So ,
30937	0	a	this means we are going to go over the priorities that were raised by the consumers a as well as incorporate all of our insight into this evaluation exercise .
30938	0	a	So
30939	1	a	I am going to go and use the whiteboard ,
30940	0	a	and I have made a list of criteria to look at , and so I am going to
30941	0	a	I am going to leave this up as the last thing , but for the evaluation it is going to be one is true and seven is false , going over these different criteria ,
30942	0	a	so
30943	0	a	one true seven false
30944	1	a	and I am going to now use the the board .
30945	0	a	Okay .
30946	0	a	So
30947	0	a	fancy , technologically innovative , easy to use , trendy , buttons , excess buttons , good buttons , ugly , sellable , and other .
30948	1	a	And in fact I hope that you all introduce some additional terms ,
30949	0	a	because these are things that have been brought up , some of them seem rather close , like they overlap .
30950	0	a	Yeah ,
30951	0	a	what about price , is that going to go on there as well ?
30952	0	a	Price of materials .
30953	0	a	, yeah , price .
30954	1	a	We will put price up at the top .
30955	0	a	Not that we actually know anything about it ,
30956	1	a	but we can we can pretend .
30957	0	a	Well
30958	0	a	we will soon , unfortunately .
30959	0	a	Okay , so
30960	0	a	Did you say ?
30961	0	a	okay ,
30962	0	a	so
30963	0	a	wha how do we feel in terms of is this fancy ?
30964	1	a	Come on .
30965	0	a	No , .
30966	0	a	It depends what what you mean by fancy really ,
30967	0	a	cause when I think of fancy , I think of it is got lots of extra sort of fripperies and , you know , like baroque curliness
30968	0	a	and which
30969	0	a	I would call these quite minimalist ,
30970	0	a	simple and plain ,
30971	0	a	but I mean I do see what
30972	0	a	it is heavily reliant on appearance instead of pure functionality ,
30973	0	a	so in that respect it is quite fancy .
30974	0	a	Yes ,
30975	0	a	a plain , simple , clean design .
30976	0	a	I
30977	0	a	yeah ,
30978	0	a	so
30979	0	a	in that respect
30980	1	a	I think we will go with that respect .
30981	1	a	I think just maybe we need a different word other than fancy , I would say maybe aesthetic .
30982	0	a	Yeah .
30983	0	a	Well
30984	0	a	we have got s trendy further down ,
30985	0	a	but
30986	0	a	Elegant , I do not know if I would call them elegant .
30987	0	a	Elegant .
30988	1	a	Elegant .
30989	0	a	Elegant .
30990	0	a	Yeah ,
30991	0	a	no
30992	0	a	these are not the exact terms that the
30993	0	a	Yeah .
30994	0	a	like stylish or aesthetic .
30995	0	a	Stylish , yeah .
30996	1	a	Elegant .
30997	1	a	We are gon let is use elegant ,
30998	0	a	although the the the people , the word on the street is is
30999	0	a	Yeah .
31000	0	a	Fancy .
31001	0	a	N that
31002	0	a	yeah the is fancy .
31003	0	a	Did you just break the pen ?
31004	0	a	Well
31005	0	a	d
31006	1	a	we will just call it fancy then .
31007	0	a	So
31008	1	a	let is let is take it to the next level .
31009	0	a	Well okay , so
31010	0	a	in terms of elegant , fancy .
31011	0	a	we will call it EF , do we do we think that perhaps and maybe we should say the yellow ?
31012	0	a	Should we go with the yellow
31013	0	a	in terms of
31014	0	a	I think that is a really superior
31015	0	a	they are both
31016	0	a	Yeah .
31017	0	a	Yeah ,
31018	0	a	I think we n we need to
31019	0	a	they are both yellow with black buttons , it is just that we did not have any more dough to represent that , but if you can just imagine banana shape with these bits as black .
31020	0	a	Yeah .
31021	0	a	So what we re really need to decide is whether we want the actual banana shape or just a a purely blob or some sort of abstraction in between the two
31022	0	a	that is not
31023	0	a	that is more curved , like a banana , but that is not actually recognisable as a banana , you know , with the grooves and the stalk and stuff ,
31024	0	a	so .
31025	0	a	Yeah .
31026	0	a	As a banana .
31027	0	a	I think that many of us are abstract enough to look at the yellow one and say we will call it the banana .
31028	0	a	Yeah .
31029	0	a	And of the two I really like
31030	0	a	I m
31031	0	a	I like the banana , but I I do like the chunk .
31032	0	a	The chunk .
31033	0	a	So
31034	1	a	that is maybe not something we have to decide just right now ,
31035	0	a	is it .
31036	0	a	No ,
31037	0	a	but I mean in terms
31038	1	a	we have to evaluate one of them .
31039	1	a	Just somewhere a long the scale of in between these two .
31040	0	a	Unless do you guys want to evaluate both ?
31041	0	a	Okay .
31042	0	a	I think between the two , somewhere between the two is true .
31043	0	a	Yeah ,
31044	0	a	I would
31045	0	a	I d I do not think that is what we are aiming at with this concept .
31046	0	a	It is more true than false , about a two .
31047	0	a	So
31048	0	a	we say true .
31049	0	a	technologically innovative .
31050	0	a	Yeah .
31051	0	a	I think we are using simple components that are going to be robust but not particularly innovative .
31052	0	a	So
31053	0	a	we will say we will say false .
31054	0	a	Easy to use .
31055	0	a	Very .
31056	0	a	Yes .
31057	0	a	One , is that inappropriate ?
31058	0	a	Okay .
31059	0	a	Yeah .
31060	0	a	Oh , pardon me .
31061	0	a	trendy , s
31062	0	a	and I say specifically spongy fruity .
31063	0	a	Trendy .
31064	0	a	Oh yes .
31065	0	a	Well ,
31066	0	a	maybe only a two or a three then ,
31067	0	a	cause it is no
31068	0	a	we still have not decided about specific sponginess or specific
31069	0	a	Yeah , I do not really think that is going to work ,
31070	0	a	but
31071	0	a	No .
31072	0	a	We have the worry about how robust it will be if it is it is curved as a banana but spongy .
31073	0	a	I think
31074	0	a	yeah .
31075	0	a	Okay , so
31076	0	a	two ?
31077	0	a	are there excess buttons ?
31078	0	a	That is false .
31079	0	a	Yeah .
31080	0	a	Excess buttons .
31081	0	a	No .
31082	0	a	No .
31083	0	a	So that is false .
31084	0	a	good , well designed buttons , intuitive buttons .
31085	0	a	Better , more intuitive buttons , yes .
31086	0	a	True .
31087	0	a	Ugly .
31088	0	a	No .
31089	0	a	No .
31090	0	a	No .
31091	0	a	People do not respond well to ugly .
31092	0	a	Sellable , quirky ,
31093	0	a	you know ,
31094	0	a	something people
31095	0	a	like oh ,
31096	0	a	yeah .
31097	0	a	Yeah , I think they are different ,
31098	0	a	are not they ?
31099	0	a	Well
31100	0	a	it is quite it is quite quirky I think .
31101	0	a	I like it .
31102	0	a	Yeah , I do too .
31103	0	a	It could be quite a good brand , like a good little object .
31104	0	a	Oh yeah .
31105	1	a	And I was I was thinking of other things
31106	0	a	in terms of
31107	0	a	could we say it is cost saving ?
31108	0	a	With the
31109	0	a	Yeah , with the energy .
31110	0	a	Oh ,
31111	1	a	we also need tho think about the energy .
31112	0	a	Is it the kinetic energy ?
31113	0	a	If it is
31114	0	a	it is going to be environmentally friendly with the kinetic energy .
31115	0	a	Yeah .
31116	0	a	It is going to be kinetic ?
31117	0	a	Yeah ,
31118	1	a	we will c we will say it is a cost saving enviro .
31119	0	a	Yeah .
31120	0	a	so
31121	0	a	yes .
31122	0	a	Yeah ,
31123	0	a	but we have not completely developed that side of it yet ,
31124	0	a	so we are not completely sure about that ,
31125	0	a	but
31126	0	a	yeah .
31127	0	a	Well
31128	0	a	you are still in the Play Doh stage .
31129	0	a	Yeah .
31130	0	a	Anything else ?
31131	0	a	Including price ,
31132	0	a	do you have any idea about price or other features ?
31133	0	a	Okay .
31134	0	a	Well
31135	0	a	I think our instinct is that it should be pretty cheap to develop .
31136	0	a	We have not got a lot of expensive components in there .
31137	0	a	Yes , the instinct says true .
31138	0	a	So true one or should I go to two or three ?
31139	0	a	Okay .
31140	0	a	I would put it at one I think ,
31141	0	a	but
31142	0	a	I dunno ,
31143	0	a	what do you
31144	0	a	Yeah , true ,
31145	0	a	it might be the
31146	0	a	yeah ,
31147	0	a	yeah , true .
31148	0	a	I would say maybe a two ,
31149	1	a	cause we still we need to get somebody in who is good with the programming for the menus and things .
31150	0	a	I mean it is not just like I mean it is not like ev you know , on a normal chunky remote every button res
31151	0	a	I mean means something different , whereas this one has only got the four buttons and they all they mean everything , depending on what menu you are in .
31152	0	a	Yeah ,
31153	0	a	that is not a cheap thing to get .
31154	0	a	True .
31155	0	a	Yeah , that is a good point .
31156	1	a	we need somebody to develop that .
31157	0	a	other ?
31158	0	a	Anything else you guys can thing of ?
31159	1	a	And I am going to actually change a couple of these
31160	0	a	so then I am going to
31161	1	a	instead of ugly I am going to say it is attractive and then make that true ,
31162	0	a	so that
31163	0	a	cause I have to do an average .
31164	0	a	Yeah .
31165	0	a	Right .
31166	1	a	And then excess buttons .
31167	1	a	Just putting no excess buttons .
31168	0	a	Exactly .
31169	0	a	Wow we are doing really well .
31170	0	a	Yeah ,
31171	0	a	be
31172	0	a	you know ,
31173	0	a	so it does not ruin the polarity .
31174	0	a	As for
31175	0	a	see if we are technologically innovative , I would say it is quite innovative ,
31176	0	a	because there are not really many that have this menu idea instead of all the extra buttons .
31177	0	a	I mean I know we are not doing anything involving internet or speech recognition
31178	0	a	but but we are at the upper end of the push button market .
31179	0	a	Or LCD .
31180	0	a	Yeah .
31181	0	a	Well
31182	0	a	if you g
31183	0	a	let me know if if any of these if you if you all can think of any other thing to change here if you th if you think I should change the innovative or add other features .
31184	1	a	If not I will average those .
31185	0	a	I think we are good .
31186	0	a	Okay .
31187	0	a	Okay .
31188	0	a	So okay ,
31189	1	a	how about if I pass this back to you
31190	1	a	and I will figure out the average here .
31191	0	a	We are a little over halfway through the meeting
31192	1	a	and the next big thing is the finance .
31193	0	a	Okay .
31194	0	a	Yep .
31195	0	a	Right .
31196	0	a	Thank you for everyone is help with that .
31197	0	a	Right .
31198	0	a	And as you can see it says the same thing , it had not lost itself ,
31199	0	a	thank Goodness .
31200	1	a	And we are going to raise what is called a sp a spreadsheet
31201	0	a	that they provided to me .
31202	0	a	and
31203	0	a	it says fill in the number of components you plan to use in your device .
31204	0	a	Hand dynamo , battery , kinetic , solar cells .
31205	0	a	Okay .
31206	0	a	Well ,
31207	1	a	just kinetic then , .
31208	0	a	Yeah .
31209	0	a	Yeah .
31210	0	a	what is a hand dynamo ?
31211	0	a	Oh
31212	0	a	shoot ,
31213	0	a	forget that .
31214	0	a	That was the crank , wind up crank on the side .
31215	0	a	It is the wind up .
31216	0	a	Kinetic is
31217	0	a	and how many of those will we need per
31218	0	a	we only need one .
31219	0	a	Just one .
31220	0	a	Okay .
31221	0	a	Electronic simple chip on print , and we will need one of those .
31222	0	a	yeah ,
31223	0	a	I think we can do it all with simple
31224	1	a	Just checking that .
31225	0	a	Yeah , simple , cause we have just got push buttons , so we can do it all with simple which is the ch should be the cheapest .
31226	0	a	Okay ,
31227	0	a	and we only need one of those .
31228	0	a	Yep .
31229	0	a	Okay ,
31230	0	a	the case will be uncurved and flat or a single curve or a double curve .
31231	0	a	It looks like it single curve , cause of th the chunkiness .
31232	0	a	It is
31233	0	a	that is one .
31234	0	a	Yeah , that that one is single curve ,
31235	0	a	is not it ?
31236	0	a	do we have
31237	0	a	I
31238	0	a	I think you it means you reverse the curve .
31239	0	a	What does double curved mean , I do not understand .
31240	0	a	And that is
31241	0	a	that is the the one that goes like this .
31242	0	a	Oh
31243	0	a	no , we do not need that .
31244	0	a	Yeah .
31245	0	a	No .
31246	0	a	Yeah , I do I do not think we need that for either of them ,
31247	0	a	you can do a banana in single curve ,
31248	0	a	yeah .
31249	0	a	Right .
31250	0	a	Single curved , I would say .
31251	0	a	No ,
31252	0	a	single curve .
31253	0	a	Okay ,
31254	0	a	case material supplements .
31255	0	a	Plastic , wood , rubber , titanium , special colour .
31256	0	a	I
31257	0	a	I just want to say plastic .
31258	0	a	We had the special colour .
31259	0	a	And did we say plastic ?
31260	0	a	Yeah .
31261	0	a	Yeah ,
31262	0	a	can we do some what ifs ,
31263	0	a	cause it may
31264	0	a	I mean I
31265	0	a	I still quite like the idea of combining plastic and rubber myself , but it depends on the cost
31266	0	a	, I guess .
31267	0	a	One , two , three , four , five , six .
31268	0	a	Okay .
31269	0	a	We will come back , if we can , to the rubber being added at the moment , that is where we are .
31270	0	a	Interface button push button interface .
31271	0	a	It is just button .
31272	0	a	Yeah .
31273	0	a	That is what we are using ,
31274	0	a	is not it ?
31275	0	a	Whoops ,
31276	0	a	do not want that , not yet .
31277	0	a	Yes .
31278	0	a	Yep .
31279	0	a	Yeah .
31280	0	a	Do we need to say how many buttons ,
31281	0	a	or
31282	0	a	or d is it just one ?
31283	0	a	Kay .
31284	0	a	No , it just says push button interface .
31285	1	a	Button supplements , they will be in a special colour of black .
31286	0	a	And the buttons Wha what is the buttons made of , rubber ?
31287	0	a	So we need one of them .
31288	0	a	they will be rubber , yep .
31289	0	a	And are they any special form ?
31290	0	a	Cause the rate we are going we can put the rubber on top .
31291	0	a	Well
31292	0	a	yeah , like the compass point one .
31293	0	a	Actually ,
31294	0	a	does tha does special material mean that plastic is not a special material ?
31295	0	a	Cause I think they can be plastic .
31296	0	a	Yeah .
31297	0	a	They could be plastic ,
31298	0	a	we do not have to have rubber buttons , because we have not got a double curved case .
31299	0	a	Oh .
31300	0	a	Yeah , they could be plastic .
31301	0	a	Okay .
31302	1	a	let is put that rubber in then , of the case material supplement .
31303	0	a	It is just one ,
31304	0	a	is not it ?
31305	0	a	What , we are in .
31306	0	a	we only need one of them .
31307	0	a	and the total cost has been calculated as nine Pounds twenty out of the twelve and a half we were allowed .
31308	0	a	Yeah .
31309	0	a	We are in .
31310	0	a	That is us .
31311	0	a	More profit .
31312	0	a	Great .
31313	0	a	Okay ,
31314	1	a	I am going to save this into our desktop , project documents .
31315	1	a	Okay .
31316	1	a	As our project document bit .
31317	0	a	Do you do you need to double click on that to open it ?
31318	0	a	Yeah ,
31319	0	a	yeah , the Play Doh was best , I thought .
31320	0	a	Yeah .
31321	0	a	There we are .
31322	0	a	That is the only Excel document that will be in there , so it is there for all of us .
31323	0	a	Okay , so ,
31324	0	a	are they under twelve fifty ?
31325	0	a	Yes ,
31326	1	a	go to the project evaluation , next slide .
31327	0	a	Yes .
31328	0	a	Right .
31329	0	a	the project process , satisfaction with , for example , the room for creativity .
31330	0	a	Yeah ,
31331	0	a	leadership , teamwork , means , of having whiteboard , the digital pens and all that kind of good things .
31332	0	a	Sure .
31333	0	a	Yeah .
31334	0	a	Yes .
31335	0	a	And Play Doh .
31336	0	a	Uh huh .
31337	0	a	Yeah well ,
31338	0	a	cause I mean it is so hard to describe what you mean just with words and pointing at photographs and saying , well we quite want this , but imagine it rounder .
31339	0	a	So much better just to go and
31340	0	a	, you know , this is it , this is what we want .
31341	0	a	Yep .
31342	0	a	Okay .
31343	0	a	So ,
31344	0	a	we went over all those things
31345	0	a	and we are satisfied with all the above .
31346	0	a	Yep .
31347	0	a	did we find any new ideas ?
31348	0	a	So
31349	0	a	we actually worked well as a group .
31350	0	a	I think with the marketing element of fruit shaped I
31351	0	a	I mean I that really opened my eyes .
31352	0	a	Yeah .
31353	0	a	Spongy .
31354	0	a	I I only speak for myself though .
31355	0	a	And I would never heard of the kinetic energy before , so .
31356	0	a	Yeah .
31357	0	a	Good work as a design team ,
31358	0	a	because we
31359	0	a	Oh yes .
31360	0	a	Yeah , I think we are a good team actually .
31361	0	a	I am not sure all the wires are really great though .
31362	0	a	I thought so .
31363	0	a	Right .
31364	0	a	Are the costs within the budget ?
31365	0	a	Yes .
31366	0	a	Yes .
31367	0	a	Yes .
31368	0	a	Is the project evaluated ?
31369	0	a	Yes .
31370	0	a	Yes .
31371	0	a	Yes .
31372	1	a	I can give you a number ,
31373	0	a	it is
31374	0	a	the average evaluation score is one point eight eight ,
31375	0	a	so it means w
31376	0	a	you know ,
31377	1	a	I can I can spell it out .
31378	0	a	Oh
31379	1	a	hang on ,
31380	0	a	we have not heard .
31381	0	a	Uh huh .
31382	0	a	There were six true or ones ,
31383	0	a	four
31384	0	a	pardon me ,
31385	0	a	two s almost true or close to true ,
31386	0	a	so that was four points , and then one false , seven points ,
31387	0	a	so seventeen divided by nine
31388	0	a	we are between one and two .
31389	0	a	I would say that is ex excellent in terms of ho how much we adhere to the ideals of the market place .
31390	0	a	Yeah .
31391	0	a	And the the only false one is because we have chosen to keep a simple old technology ,
31392	1	a	which if it works perfectly well I see no point in improving on if it works ,
31393	0	a	so .
31394	0	a	To maintain old technology ,
31395	0	a	exactly .
31396	0	a	Yeah ,
31397	0	a	yeah .
31398	0	a	Absolutely ,
31399	0	a	and it is kept us within budget .
31400	0	a	Yes .
31401	0	a	Yeah .
31402	0	a	So we do count as I think excellent or one .
31403	0	a	Alright .
31404	0	a	And we have therefore we have to do the final questionnaire and do the meeting summary , I have a final report to present , and then we are done .
31405	0	a	Okay .
31406	0	a	We done good ,
31407	0	a	and we are finished in time .
31408	0	a	Bring on the ice sculptures .
31409	0	a	Nice .
31410	0	a	And then we get the product launch party .
31411	0	a	So
31412	0	a	we might have to wait .
31413	0	a	Yeah .
31414	0	a	Product launch party ?
31415	0	a	Yeah .
31416	0	a	I one thing I want to do is
31417	0	a	oh ,
31418	0	a	I think the meeting is done .
31419	0	a	I believe that is the end of our meeting .
31420	0	a	Yeah .
31421	1	a	one thing
31422	1	a	I wa
31423	1	a	I want to do
31424	1	a	is save everything in the right files ,
31425	0	a	because I do not think everything is saved .
31426	0	a	The right files .
31427	0	a	 
31428	0	a	Right , so
31429	0	a	start of the first meeting .
31430	0	a	Right , so agenda of the first meeting .
31431	0	a	Where we We have twenty five minutes for this meeting .
31432	0	a	Okay .
31433	0	a	We are to get acquainted .
31434	1	a	So does everyone want to say who they are ?
31435	0	a	that seem sensible ?
31436	0	a	And I am Alastair and I am the project leader .
31437	0	a	Yeah .
31438	0	a	I am Robin .
31439	0	a	I am the Marketing Manager .
31440	0	a	I am Louisa .
31441	0	a	I am the User Interface Designer .
31442	0	a	I am Nick .
31443	0	a	I am the Industrial Designer .
31444	0	a	Alright okay ,
31445	0	a	so tool training .
31446	0	a	Project plan .
31447	0	a	So does anyone have any thoughts as to the tool training that is required ?
31448	0	a	Neither am I .
31449	0	a	I am not exactly sure what you mean by tool training .
31450	0	a	Oh I see ,
31451	0	a	so we should not really be
31452	0	a	Oh right okay ,
31453	0	a	so .
31454	0	a	So we have the project team , which is to basically to come up with a new r remote control device .
31455	0	a	we have the starting base was the original which has been in existence now for a period of time .
31456	0	a	And our idea is to to make the new remote control device more user friendly than the previous one , and to to be trendier , to be with it , and therefore to to get a bigger market share and bigger audience .
31457	0	a	Tool training
31458	0	a	Yeah .
31459	0	a	So
31460	0	a	method of doing this is split up as you can see into the functional design , the conceptional design , and the detailed design
31461	0	a	So
31462	0	a	in each of these phases we will basically be handing over to yourselves , the designers of this this device .
31463	0	a	Yes .
31464	0	a	And having meetings so that we can during the course of the day come up with a better better inst implement than we had before .
31465	0	a	And therefore have a successful conclusion to the day .
31466	0	a	and you will be doing various designs throughout the day to meet this end .
31467	0	a	, okay .
31468	0	a	So we have got tool training .
31469	0	a	Try out whiteboard .
31470	0	a	So we will .
31471	0	a	Right so everyone is to supposedly draw their favourite animal over on the white board over there .
31472	0	a	I guess this is make sure the whiteboard works .
31473	1	a	So I do not know who wishes to go first .
31474	0	a	Okay .
31475	1	a	Do you wish to go f Have a first bash at whatever .
31476	1	a	I do not mind .
31477	0	a	I dunno .
31478	0	a	Let is see .
31479	0	a	Good job I got pockets today .
31480	0	a	Your microphone is just
31481	0	a	Yeah .
31482	0	a	But now you you you will move out from the microphone and the camera .
31483	0	a	I take it that I would I would guess so .
31484	0	a	Are we supposed to do this right now , do you think , or ?
31485	0	a	Oh .
31486	0	a	Or
31487	0	a	Technical problems .
31488	0	a	You have lost your microphone there .
31489	0	a	I do not know .
31490	0	a	Right here we go .
31491	0	a	I mean you designers are meant to come up with these sort of things .
31492	0	a	Okay .
31493	0	a	I think that I would have to say that my favourite animal is the cat .
31494	0	a	Little smiley cat there .
31495	0	a	and this would be because they are very independent , they are very intelligent , compared to dogs maybe .
31496	0	a	and they can be very very affectionate .
31497	0	a	Some people do not think so
31498	0	a	but I know very affectionate cats .
31499	0	a	and they can look after themselves .
31500	1	a	Next .
31501	1	a	Okay , yeah .
31502	1	a	I will I will Shall I see if I can get across without just tangling everything .
31503	0	a	Shall I rub that out , actually ?
31504	0	a	That is quite good .
31505	0	a	I do not see as there is any need to .
31506	0	a	There is plenty of space .
31507	0	a	I mean whatever .
31508	0	a	We can have have a whole menagerie .
31509	0	a	Exactly .
31510	0	a	Okay .
31511	0	a	There is one .
31512	0	a	We have had more time to prepare over this side , so we have all stuck our bits and pieces in our pockets .
31513	0	a	Did not think of that .
31514	0	a	Kay
31515	0	a	pens are over here .
31516	0	a	The three pens are underneath .
31517	0	a	I will try the red pen .
31518	0	a	Okay .
31519	0	a	I am going to go for the bear
31520	0	a	which I am be able to draw very well ,
31521	1	a	but I will have a bash at it .
31522	0	a	You get marks for artistic impression .
31523	0	a	Ooh ooh
31524	0	a	I lost it there .
31525	0	a	I think I have just knocked the microphone .
31526	0	a	So you are just doing the face .
31527	0	a	We will g then we will go for a a s small small bear .
31528	0	a	and I like my animal that looks nothing like a bear because I dunno maybe because there is so many cartoon characters made up after the bear like the jungle book characters and stuff like that .
31529	0	a	Great .
31530	0	a	Right .
31531	0	a	Hello .
31532	0	a	I am going to go for the dog , and I am going to draw one badly as well .
31533	0	a	looks like it is going to be a dachshund or something .
31534	0	a	Right .
31535	0	a	There is my dog .
31536	0	a	I like dogs because they are very loyal .
31537	0	a	And they are always happy , so whenever whenever you are feeling sort of a bit a bit down or tired , they are always coming up and they are always quite excited .
31538	0	a	So you can always have a lot of fun with a dog .
31539	0	a	And they are also good for exercise as well .
31540	0	a	You can sorta get out and they they sorta never get tired .
31541	0	a	And and when they are tired they are quite cute as well , so .
31542	0	a	Okay , that is why I like dogs .
31543	0	a	Right , .
31544	0	a	Well I have not actually had too many pets over my time cause to be honest with you
31545	0	a	I am not too keen on them anyway .
31546	0	a	Not to worry .
31547	0	a	So what my daughters have got at the moment is they have got a few fish
31548	0	a	and so hopefully wo not prove too difficult to draw .
31549	0	a	As you can see that my artist artistic work is useless as well .
31550	0	a	Anyway .
31551	0	a	And one of the best things about fish is that they do not really take too much looking after because with most of the animals if you are going away on holiday or whatever , you have gotta spend money or get a friend or whatever to look after them for you .
31552	0	a	Whereas if you got fish , you just gotta put the food in a a a dripper feed which feeds them over the couple of weeks that you are away and change the water every couple of months , and buy in a few plants , so .
31553	0	a	Other than the fact that they keep dying , fish are are not are are are reasonable pets in that they are low maintenance .
31554	0	a	Great .
31555	0	a	Right .
31556	0	a	Okay ,
31557	0	a	if we are still all with us .
31558	0	a	Right okay ,
31559	0	a	so .
31560	0	a	Work has been done on this project where by twenty five Euros is the expected selling price .
31561	0	a	That information has come from our marketing manager here .
31562	0	a	Yeah .
31563	0	a	So we are looking to sell internationally , not just in Europe .
31564	0	a	We are looking at having our production costs limited to twelve and an half Euro per unit .
31565	0	a	And therefore making a profit margin of well not actually a profit margin it is because obviously you are going to have overheads and various other costs to take from from that to give you your profit margin per unit .
31566	0	a	And so depending what the the overhead costs are will determine how many units we are looking to sell or projecting to sell at this point in time .
31567	0	a	So
31568	0	a	Experience with remote control , first ideas .
31569	0	a	New remote .
31570	0	a	So I guess we are looking at having a discussion at this point in time to help you folks design our our new model as it were .
31571	0	a	Yes .
31572	0	a	So any any thoughts ?
31573	0	a	Okay , so so basically we are looking for some we are looking for a device that is robust and and therefore wo not get damaged too easily .
31574	0	a	I with some remote controls the buttons were a little small so they are quite hard to press
31575	1	a	so maybe we make something with easy to press buttons .
31576	0	a	As that is the main function .
31577	0	a	Yes .
31578	0	a	we are looking for a device that is
31579	0	a	What was the other things you said there ?
31580	0	a	Easy to use .
31581	0	a	sort of easy to use so the buttons are accessible .
31582	0	a	Use .
31583	0	a	is easy to use and see .
31584	0	a	And see .
31585	0	a	Yes .
31586	0	a	Okay .
31587	1	a	Can I just check ?
31588	0	a	Is this just a television remote ?
31589	0	a	Because a lot of systems are kind of TV video combined now , or TV DVD combined .
31590	0	a	And one of the most annoying things is having like five remotes in the house .
31591	1	a	So if you have got a combined system , it could be a combined remote .
31592	0	a	Or is it just a television that we are supposed to be doing ?
31593	1	a	Comes to your whistle .
31594	0	a	Oh I w
31595	0	a	basically I will get back to you on that .
31596	0	a	But it seems to me sensible ,
31597	0	a	cause as you rightly said , there is nothing more annoying than having three or four devices littered about the about the room .
31598	0	a	Yeah .
31599	0	a	And
31600	0	a	So a device for for all remotes .
31601	0	a	I have
31602	1	a	Okay .
31603	0	a	Sorry ,
31604	1	a	you go .
31605	1	a	You go .
31606	1	a	Yeah .
31607	0	a	one of the things we found from the market research is that people often get confused by the number of buttons on them as well .
31608	0	a	Cause there is quite often lots and lots .
31609	0	a	And sometimes they sort of remote controls defeat their own purpose because you are sat in the chair and the remote is somewhere else in the room .
31610	0	a	So whereas in the past you would have to get up to change the channel , now you have to get up to sort of pick up the remote .
31611	0	a	So so I do not
31612	1	a	we need to sort of maybe think about how we could maybe develop a remote control which moves around the room .
31613	0	a	That is that is maybe something for the future when you can talk to your television , but
31614	0	a	Yeah .
31615	0	a	Yeah .
31616	0	a	But is it in a sense it is r mutually exclusive .
31617	0	a	You ca not have both the th the one device and then have few buttons on it to cause you want you want simplicity as well , you want any idiot to be able to use it .
31618	0	a	Yeah .
31619	0	a	Whilst at the same time you want , as you rightly said , one remote for all .
31620	0	a	And so these are probably mutually exclusive options
31621	0	a	that
31622	0	a	you could argue that experience of using devices and similar devices as people get more and more used to using remotes , therefore they are more with handling them , therefore you can make them more complicated as time goes on .
31623	0	a	Yes .
31624	0	a	Yeah .
31625	1	a	Maybe we could have better instructions with the remote .
31626	0	a	Or are we just doing the design of the remote control itself , or sort of the instructions that would come with it ?
31627	0	a	Kay .
31628	0	a	Better instructions .
31629	0	a	Yeah .
31630	0	a	I mean we have done some research about sort of you know what the cutting edge sort of hand held devices are , and a lot of them sort of use you know they are like they are like mini laptops .
31631	1	a	So it is possible that we could devise a system where where you are
31632	1	a	you are basically sort of holding a a miniature computer which is controlling all your your sort of your television , your stereo , and where you know if you buy a new thing then it sort of you can link it to that as well , maybe .
31633	0	a	Okay .
31634	0	a	well we have got five minutes before the end of the meeting .
31635	0	a	So we have to start winding up .
31636	0	a	is there
31637	0	a	Next meeting in thirty minutes .
31638	0	a	Okay .
31639	0	a	So
31640	0	a	Right , so we have got ID
31641	0	a	the
31642	0	a	Come on ,
31643	0	a	where is my
31644	0	a	Oh there we go .
31645	0	a	If you just click return it should be okay .
31646	0	a	It will get rid of the message .
31647	0	a	Or not .
31648	1	a	If you hit just hit return and it should get rid of the message .
31649	0	a	Oh you have got .
31650	0	a	Yeah .
31651	0	a	That is what I was looking for .
31652	0	a	Right .
31653	0	a	So we have got function
31654	0	a	Oh what happened to the
31655	0	a	Right .
31656	0	a	I think that might be back to the start .
31657	0	a	Yeah .
31658	1	a	if you grab the kind of slide to the left and pull it down ?
31659	0	a	I am not exactly clear on what we are designing the rem remote for .
31660	0	a	slide four
31661	0	a	Okay .
31662	0	a	Yeah .
31663	0	a	Right .
31664	0	a	Sorry about that .
31665	0	a	Okay , so we have got the working design for ID .
31666	0	a	For UID the technical functions design .
31667	0	a	Marketing , the user requirement specification .
31668	0	a	Specific instructions will be sent to you by your person by your personal coach .
31669	0	a	So .
31670	0	a	Are we all clear what objectives we are looking to meet in the next thirty minutes ?
31671	1	a	And I guess I will try and write up some minutes of this meeting to to give it to you for the next meeting .
31672	0	a	Yes .
31673	0	a	Kay , yes .
31674	0	a	Is this a mun multi functional one or do we decide that ourselves as we go away and work on it ?
31675	0	a	Right .
31676	0	a	I think you just said at the start it was a television remote control ,
31677	1	a	so maybe we should just stick to that unless we get told otherwise .
31678	0	a	Television remote control .
31679	0	a	That is true ,
31680	0	a	cause during during the course of our day we might make decisions based on information or meetings that would change where we are going .
31681	0	a	Okay cool .
31682	0	a	But at this point in time I think you are right that shall we make it just a TV .
31683	0	a	Okay ?
31684	0	a	So we will depart .
31685	0	a	Kay
31686	0	a	We will stay here and and break off .
31687	1	a	And I will do minutes
31688	0	a	and and we will see you in half and hour .
31689	0	a	Okay .
31690	0	a	 
31691	0	a	Right .
31692	0	a	So .
31693	0	a	So where is the PowerPoint presentation ?
31694	0	a	Sorry ?
31695	0	a	Microsoft PowerPoint , right .
31696	0	a	Right , okay .
31697	0	a	So .
31698	0	a	Right .
31699	0	a	Okay , so we have got
31700	0	a	so we have got new project requirements .
31701	0	a	So basically we have got three things , and we have got forty minutes in which to for this meeting to to discuss the various options .
31702	0	a	Three presentations .
31703	0	a	We have a
31704	0	a	I guess we have a presentation each , cause I have got one .
31705	0	a	Yeah .
31706	0	a	Yeah ,
31707	0	a	I have got one too .
31708	0	a	I see , right .
31709	0	a	That is nice to know ,
31710	0	a	one from each of you .
31711	0	a	new project requirements .
31712	0	a	so do we want to do the presentation first ,
31713	0	a	or do we want to
31714	0	a	W
31715	0	a	I
31716	0	a	I got or or three things basically , relating to the remote being only for TV .
31717	0	a	We discussed that last time and in actual fact that was pr pretty well what we came up with anyway .
31718	0	a	So in fact it actually f we wo not be forestalled in a sense .
31719	0	a	we have got teletext outdated .
31720	0	a	did you get any information on that ?
31721	0	a	Right and the corporate image was the final thing .
31722	0	a	we did not , no .
31723	0	a	No .
31724	0	a	I d I did not personally .
31725	0	a	So I I got that in email form .
31726	0	a	Right okay .
31727	0	a	So
31728	0	a	I guess if we go ahead with the with the three presentations .
31729	0	a	So we will start with yourself
31730	0	a	on the basis that
31731	0	a	Sorry ,
31732	0	a	yep .
31733	0	a	Okay that is fine .
31734	1	a	I will just I will grab the wire out the back of this one .
31735	0	a	Oh .
31736	0	a	What is it ?
31737	1	a	I think you have got to do control F eight .
31738	0	a	I am not quite sure how it
31739	0	a	Control
31740	0	a	Does not seem to be quite working at the moment .
31741	1	a	Shift F eight .
31742	1	a	Alt function F eight .
31743	0	a	Again not doing anything .
31744	0	a	There is usually a little thing in the top right for the Oh hang on , it is just coming on .
31745	0	a	Oh .
31746	0	a	there , it is doing something .
31747	0	a	pressed about five times now .
31748	0	a	Okay , that is me .
31749	0	a	Okay , I have to go again .
31750	0	a	it going ?
31751	0	a	Okay .
31752	0	a	Hopefully that should be it this time .
31753	0	a	Okay , I think we are there .
31754	0	a	That is good .
31755	0	a	Okay ,
31756	0	a	Okay I am going to be looking at the working design .
31757	0	a	of the of the remote control .
31758	0	a	I have just got three sections , first is the research I made on the on the remote control itself .
31759	0	a	And then that involves the components required in it and the systems design of the actual the actual remote .
31760	0	a	so having researched the existing models within the market , I found my research off the internet .
31761	0	a	I have established what the components required for the remote control to function , actually are .
31762	0	a	And then also the methods in which these components interact together for the remote to actually do what you want it to do and how it connects with the television .
31763	0	a	the basic components are an energy source which I guess in most existing models would be a battery supply .
31764	0	a	Whether that will be sort of two batteries , four batteries , it may vary .
31765	0	a	We then have the user interface , which is basically the like the the buttons on the actual remote .
31766	0	a	the various functions used for changing channel , channel up and down , volume , things like that .
31767	0	a	there is also a chip inside the remote which does all the computer type things .
31768	0	a	And then the sender , which is usually , I have found , an infra red device which sends a signal to the actual television .
31769	0	a	and the last part is receiver which is important in the system but is not actually part of the remote itself , because that is obviously found in the television .
31770	0	a	I am going to have to actually draw on the board because it was a little tricky on PowerPoint to get this working ,
31771	1	a	so .
31772	1	a	I will just go through there .
31773	0	a	S do we have a cloth to wipe this down with , or ?
31774	0	a	Oh I will j
31775	0	a	Oh I see .
31776	0	a	I think it is that little
31777	0	a	Right .
31778	0	a	there is the rubber on the right , I think .
31779	0	a	Oh okay .
31780	1	a	I will get rid of the bear
31781	0	a	Okay that is great .
31782	0	a	it is magic .
31783	0	a	Okay , so we start off with a battery suppl
31784	0	a	no ,
31785	0	a	a power supply
31786	0	a	which we would probably get
31787	0	a	it is probably going to be the battery .
31788	0	a	we then have a particular button ,
31789	0	a	which may be
31790	0	a	that is obviously there is lots and lots of different buttons .
31791	0	a	but this is how the basic system works .
31792	0	a	that sends
31793	0	a	after you press that that sends the message to the chip ,
31794	0	a	which then sends
31795	0	a	It sort of interprets which button you have pressed and then sends the appropriate message to the sender .
31796	0	a	So that is .
31797	0	a	That is the remote in itself , that is the components of the remote and how they work together .
31798	0	a	So this is the user interface .
31799	0	a	this is the chip itself , which then , and that is the that is the infra red sender .
31800	0	a	And then on the separate thing we have on the on the television we have a a receiver .
31801	0	a	And the sender sends a message to the receiver .
31802	0	a	Kay .
31803	0	a	So the the top bit is the power source , yes ? .
31804	0	a	yes , that is the power source .
31805	0	a	going on to personal preferences , I have said that battery seems the best option for the actual remote , just because of the size .
31806	0	a	You do not want a a cable attached to the remote otherwise it is not it is not really a remote .
31807	0	a	and then the sender , and infra red has been used quite successfully .
31808	0	a	If the battery is on reasonable power , they always seem to work fairly well .
31809	0	a	You do not have to be point directly at the television itself .
31810	0	a	So the battery is the in the sender .
31811	0	a	Yes .
31812	0	a	Kay and that is it for the moment .
31813	0	a	Okay .
31814	0	a	Okay .
31815	0	a	So , now more design .
31816	0	a	Thank you .
31817	0	a	Mine is not quite as complicated as all that .
31818	0	a	That is what we like to hear .
31819	0	a	Did I press function ?
31820	0	a	Yeah .
31821	0	a	Is it control function
31822	0	a	ei
31823	0	a	Oh , th there you go .
31824	0	a	Oh .
31825	0	a	Okay so I am going to talk a bit about the technical functions design .
31826	0	a	I am Louisa , the User Interface Designer , as you know .
31827	0	a	so the m basic method of this is to send a signal from the remote to the television set , so that a desired function is performed .
31828	0	a	an example of the function could be to change the volume up or down , so obviously you need two different buttons for that .
31829	0	a	to change the channel , either by pressing the number that you want or by channel up or down .
31830	0	a	to switch the television on or off , maybe a standby button .
31831	0	a	here are two example remotes .
31832	0	a	by the look of it they both have kind of play and fast forward , rewind functions , so I think they incorporate a kind of video function which we wo not have to worry about .
31833	0	a	but as you can see , the left remote is quite quite busy looking , quite complicated .
31834	0	a	whereas the right remote is much simpler , it looks much more user friendly .
31835	0	a	so my personal preference would be the right remote .
31836	0	a	So , it is got nice big buttons , it is got a very limited number of buttons .
31837	0	a	they are nice , kind of clearly labelled .
31838	0	a	I like the use of the kind of symbols like the triangles and the squares and the arrows as well as the words on the kind of play functions and all that .
31839	0	a	So it is very very user friendly , and it is got a little splash of colour .
31840	0	a	Could maybe do with some more colour .
31841	0	a	Well there is a couple of things there .
31842	0	a	we have to remember that we have our own logo and colour scheme .
31843	0	a	So basically we would have to we would have to be putting that on the the product .
31844	0	a	Do we get to see that ?
31845	0	a	Will you be presenting that in a bit ?
31846	0	a	I have not as yet , no .
31847	0	a	But I got I got an email that basically said to make sure that whatever device we come up with at the end of the day had to incorporate the corporate colour and slogan .
31848	0	a	So I am guessing that
31849	0	a	I notice on the bottom there it is got
31850	0	a	what is that ?
31851	0	a	APOGEE
31852	1	a	that might be the corporate colour scheme ,
31853	0	a	although the only the only colour I can see in that is the red .
31854	0	a	Would you be able to get rid of the the extra buttons here , the the sort of circular section ,
31855	0	a	because that seems to be for a video as well .
31856	1	a	So we could dispense with that little bit as well and just get it down to just the numbers and the volume .
31857	0	a	What do you mean by the circular section ?
31858	0	a	Like all of that bottom bit ?
31859	0	a	Yeah .
31860	0	a	Possibly ?
31861	0	a	J
31862	0	a	yeah
31863	0	a	yeah
31864	0	a	yeah
31865	0	a	j
31866	0	a	yeah
31867	0	a	just this little bit
31868	0	a	is that
31869	0	a	I think that is still a video remote part ,
31870	1	a	so maybe we could get rid of that as well .
31871	0	a	Yeah .
31872	0	a	And I do not really think that you need nine numbers .
31873	0	a	Well b w Well th the on the
31874	0	a	Well for for general television purposes obviously you have channels one to five at this point in time , and we would have to have some room for future such channels .
31875	0	a	I mean how often do you use seven , eight and nine ?
31876	1	a	I think just one to six and then channel up and down should be enough .
31877	0	a	Like how often do you hit nine ?
31878	0	a	It is just people are used to seeing that , so if we did not have them then they might think it is
31879	0	a	But but
31880	0	a	But ,
31881	0	a	well possibly
31882	0	a	but the the other thing is that with the current expansion of channels in the process of taking place , certainly the button up and down ,
31883	0	a	but I mean how many channels do we have to actual television channels do we have to prepare for ?
31884	0	a	I would have thought that it is forever expanding and at the moment we have got although you have onl
31885	0	a	you have got the five standard , you have got the BBC have come up with a further six and there is
31886	0	a	I do not know exactly how many channels there are on when you take into account Sky and various other various others .
31887	0	a	So I would have thought that we would not , you know , rather
31888	0	a	Okay , if the time of flicking from one to other , but presumably it will take a second cause you have to be able to stop it .
31889	1	a	Maybe you could have a fast forward on the on the channels
31890	0	a	that w
31891	1	a	and then you could dispense with more otherwise .
31892	0	a	Y you would want you would want to get fairly quickly to the channel that you wanted .
31893	0	a	some remotes have kind of favourite options where if you always flick from channel one to channel six , if that is a favourite you just like by pass two to five .
31894	1	a	Yeah , I s
31895	1	a	I suppose in a sense you could have if you have got a hundred channels then if you had sort of an easy way of getting rather than having to go one to a hundred
31896	1	a	, you could go one to one to ten , ten to twenty and then have a second button to get you to the actual channel you want
31897	0	a	and that would cut down your time .
31898	0	a	Anyway .
31899	0	a	But I think a lot of like Cable and Sky and stuff , that would be tuned to one channel , and then you would have another remote for all of those channels .
31900	0	a	Like to get to fifty five and the higher numbers
31901	0	a	Yeah .
31902	0	a	Okay , yeah .
31903	0	a	Whatever .
31904	0	a	Okay .
31905	0	a	Okay .
31906	0	a	Limit the number of buttons , user friendly .
31907	0	a	But I suppose nine is not really excessive .
31908	0	a	I suppose with nine you have got the the like the last one which makes the tenth means you it is like multiples you can put them together so you can make any number .
31909	0	a	I suppose it does make a good pattern .
31910	0	a	So with that we would kind of by pass any problems with
31911	0	a	Yeah .
31912	0	a	Yeah
31913	0	a	Well that is true , yeah ,
31914	0	a	you could get fifty by five and a zero or whatever ,
31915	0	a	that that makes sense .
31916	0	a	Yeah .
31917	0	a	Cause that facilitates having all the numbers you could ever need .
31918	0	a	Yeah .
31919	0	a	Does .
31920	0	a	Okay .
31921	0	a	So w so what was the circular thing that you were
31922	0	a	If it is just for TV , which is what it is at the moment .
31923	0	a	I think that is just for a video , so we would not need any of that at all .
31924	0	a	So we could get it down to what ?
31925	0	a	So we get to
31926	0	a	How many buttons have we got ?
31927	0	a	We have just got ten , eleven
31928	0	a	twelve th
31929	0	a	We got fourteen that we need .
31930	0	a	I guess .
31931	0	a	which is not really too many .
31932	0	a	That will be quite easy to make a user guide for a fourteen button remote .
31933	0	a	Well we have we have got that it is remote for TV only otherwise project would become too complex with which would endanger the time to market
31934	0	a	was one of the considerations .
31935	0	a	Kay .
31936	0	a	I am I do not know
31937	0	a	d did you have that information behind the marketing , or was I meant to give you that information ?
31938	0	a	Right .
31939	0	a	I am not sure .
31940	0	a	I had I have had some market information , but not from the company , no .
31941	0	a	Right , okay ,
31942	0	a	so basically time to market seems to be important , therefore speed of delivery .
31943	0	a	Kay .
31944	0	a	We have only got about another four hours left .
31945	0	a	Okay , so is everyone happy with that ?
31946	0	a	Right well that is the end of my presentation .
31947	0	a	yes yes , that seems good .
31948	0	a	Okay .
31949	0	a	Kay .
31950	1	a	I am going to pull this off .
31951	1	a	I think if you just give it a second to maybe catch up .
31952	0	a	Yeah ,
31953	0	a	I think she said twenty seconds to
31954	0	a	What was that last wee bit there ?
31955	0	a	Speech recognition ,
31956	0	a	Uh huh .
31957	0	a	Okay .
31958	0	a	I am sure we will have by the end of today .
31959	1	a	I will give it another go .
31960	0	a	Yeah , there we go .
31961	0	a	Right ,
31962	0	a	we have done some research into the functional requirements that people want out of their remote control .
31963	0	a	And first off we should state that th the remote control is for controlling the TV
31964	0	a	and how do people use it ?
31965	0	a	We asked them sort of which buttons were useful for them .
31966	0	a	how d how does a remote control look and feel for them , and what improvements would would they like to remote control .
31967	0	a	And we did that by sort of giving them a questionnaire that we would prepared and asking them to fill in the answers .
31968	0	a	And three quarters of them found that remote controls are ugly and that a sort of even higher proportion would spend more for a sort of s a fancier remote control
31969	0	a	And that of all the buttons on the remote control , the sort of setting buttons for sort of the picture picture and brightness and the audio settings , they were not used very often at all .
31970	0	a	People concentrated on the channel buttons and the volume buttons and the power buttons .
31971	0	a	we also asked them about speech recognition for remote control .
31972	0	a	And young people were quite receptive to this , but as soon as we got sort of over about into a thirty five to forty age forty five age group and older , people people were not quite so keen on speech recognition .
31973	0	a	There is a lot more th there is a lot lot more older people who did not know whether they wanted it or not as well .
31974	0	a	we also asked what frustrated people about remote controls and the number one frustration was that the remote was lost somewhere else in the room and that they could not find it .
31975	0	a	And the second second biggest frustration what that if they got a new remote control , it was difficult to learn all the buttons and all the functions , and to find your way around it .
31976	0	a	Okay , so
31977	0	a	My personal preferences from the marketing is that we need to come up with some sort of sleek sort of good looking high high tech A design which looks high tech , basically .
31978	0	a	and that we should come up with fewer buttons than most of the controls on the market , and we should sort of concentrate on the channels and sort of power , and also volume and that sort of thing , as as Louisa said .
31979	1	a	we could maybe come up with a menu , a sort of a an LCD menu for other functions on the remote control .
31980	0	a	That is worth thinking about .
31981	1	a	and maybe we could think about speech recognition as well ,
31982	0	a	because sort of young people are perhaps the ones that are going to buy buy our new product if we aim it at sort of you know sort of a high tech design .
31983	0	a	That that might be the market that we are we are looking for .
31984	0	a	And we could maybe think about using speech recogniti recognition as a way to find the remote control if it is lost in a room , rather than sort of having it to speech recognition to change the channels .
31985	0	a	Cause there is a problem with that in that the television makes noise , so it could end up talking to itself and changing its channel .
31986	0	a	Okay ,
31987	0	a	and that is the end of the slide show .
31988	0	a	That is it .
31989	0	a	Cool .
31990	0	a	Do a lot of
31991	0	a	There is key rings that you kind of whistle at or clap at , I ca not remember , and then they whistle back , or something like that .
31992	0	a	about speech recognition ?
31993	0	a	Yeah .
31994	0	a	But that was only for young people that preferred it , older people did not .
31995	0	a	Youn young people pref
31996	0	a	Yeah , they s
31997	0	a	they said that they would be interested in a remote control which offered that possibility and as you go up through the age groups , people got less and less interested in sort of a a remote control that you could talk to , so .
31998	0	a	No what I maybe think is it seems the technology would be quite advanced for that
31999	0	a	and they might end up costing more than our twelve fifty budget for for the speech recognition .
32000	0	a	Yeah .
32001	0	a	Well that is right .
32002	0	a	Yeah .
32003	0	a	Yeah .
32004	0	a	And possibly the thing about the about the remote being lost we could have
32005	0	a	You know with your mobile phone , you lose that
32006	0	a	and you can ring it .
32007	1	a	Maybe we can have some kind of sensor which is kept somewhere where you can some kind of buzzer system between the two .
32008	0	a	Yeah .
32009	0	a	So you can press a button which is always kept in one place and then it maybe buzzes to somewhere else , wherever the remote actually is .
32010	0	a	Uh huh .
32011	0	a	Yeah .
32012	0	a	Yeah , we would have t that would mean we would have to put two products together as well , which which again would probably be a bit expensive , but
32013	0	a	Yeah .
32014	0	a	That is true , yes .
32015	0	a	Sounds reasonable .
32016	0	a	Yeah .
32017	0	a	That would probably be really simple , they are cheap .
32018	0	a	Yeah .
32019	1	a	So I guess it would be something we could like attach to the or like the same technology could be put inside the inside the remote .
32020	0	a	So
32021	1	a	Well if you are trying to avoid having a second product cause obviously you could have a second product that gave you the right pitch which would set the remote off to say here I am sort of thing , you know without sound recognition .
32022	0	a	But if you I know .
32023	0	a	I was going to say a sharp noise , you know a clapping of hand or whatever .
32024	0	a	You would want to try and av just have the one product
32025	0	a	that if
32026	0	a	Yeah .
32027	0	a	Yeah .
32028	0	a	Yeah if we if we could have it in the actual remote like everything in one one device .
32029	0	a	Yeah .
32030	0	a	I dunno talking about vo
32031	0	a	I mean obviously if you have got voice recognition then you can do it in that way because it will recognise the voice
32032	0	a	and you can give it a command , a set command whatever that happened to be .
32033	0	a	Yeah .
32034	0	a	But you have then got the point if if you are not going with voice recognition then
32035	1	a	you could have an option to turn it off .
32036	1	a	Or Perhaps , .
32037	0	a	Yeah .
32038	0	a	So that would solve the problems with the TV kind of speaking to the remote and changing its own channels .
32039	0	a	So
32040	0	a	Any sugges
32041	0	a	Well , any conclusions ?
32042	0	a	Well if it does then we ca not .
32043	0	a	would it take quite a while to sort of develop the speech recognition software in the remote control ?
32044	0	a	Considering
32045	0	a	Yeah .
32046	0	a	It is that simple , because we have got th th three primary requisites from from and email that was sent to me whereby we had The design logo was one , which we have already mentioned .
32047	0	a	We have got the remote was only for the television
32048	0	a	and not for
32049	0	a	because that would make it too complex and we have to get it market quickly .
32050	0	a	And the third thing was that teletext as far as the management is concerned , is becoming dated due to the popularity of the internet .
32051	0	a	Okay .
32052	0	a	So that means that
32053	0	a	so these are the sort of three extra parameters that have been put on this project .
32054	0	a	Kay .
32055	0	a	So we are being focused effectively directly at a television and it seems to me that the management is wanting us to go down a narrow path and not opening out .
32056	0	a	Yes .
32057	0	a	So anything that is to be added , such as voice recognition et cetera has to be very simple and has to be very quick because time to market is is critical .
32058	0	a	Has to be simple enough to
32059	0	a	I suppose if we could get something in which was quite quick and simple that would give us an advantage over the other remotes .
32060	0	a	S
32061	0	a	It would .
32062	0	a	But probably quick and simple is primary rather than added extras .
32063	0	a	Kay .
32064	0	a	Added extras would be nice , but the primary consideration is to get the project finished within this short time window , which effectively now is sort of four hours .
32065	0	a	So and if
32066	0	a	and we have gotta get to the end .
32067	0	a	d d I think I think first and foremost we have gotta get to the end and then get to the end with added extras if possible .
32068	0	a	Okay .
32069	0	a	So
32070	0	a	About five minutes .
32071	0	a	Right okay , so I need to
32072	0	a	Right .
32073	0	a	So
32074	0	a	I do not know how long we have left of our time .
32075	0	a	But we have to make the decisions on the remote control functions and how we were planning to proceed so that at the next meeting each person that is got a a a task to do is clear from this meeting what that task is .
32076	0	a	Yes .
32077	0	a	We will also know w when the next meeting is I so we will know how long we have got to complete that task .
32078	0	a	And then we can report back at the next meeting and say right
32079	0	a	okay
32080	0	a	yes , we have achieved this or we have not achieved this
32081	0	a	, this is how far we have progressed .
32082	0	a	Does that make reasonable sense ?
32083	0	a	So we have to come effectively to the decision on the remote functions so that you can decide what you are going to be doing .
32084	0	a	Yes that seems right .
32085	0	a	Yeah .
32086	0	a	Okay , yeah .
32087	1	a	And if dur between the time of this meeting finishing and the next meeting starting , if you get any additional information that only you have at that point in time you would think would be relevant to other people in terms of their des decision making process , then we should communicate that as quickly as possible and not wait until the next meeting .
32088	0	a	Do it via the email
32089	0	a	so that rather than coming you know
32090	0	a	If you get the information just before the next meeting that is fine .
32091	0	a	Okay .
32092	0	a	Yep .
32093	0	a	Come along with it in the next meeting , we can discuss it then and take whatever action is appropriate .
32094	0	a	Okay .
32095	0	a	But if you get it well before the next meeting , let everybody else know cause that might have an impact on their on what they come up with effectively at the next meeting .
32096	0	a	Yeah .
32097	0	a	Okay .
32098	0	a	Right , is there
32099	0	a	I would guess so .
32100	0	a	So do we need to decide on the functions now ?
32101	0	a	S
32102	0	a	Well I think it would be really easy and it would be a big advantage if we did have some sort of kind of whistle back kind of function .
32103	0	a	Yeah
32104	0	a	and
32105	0	a	Yeah and that was that was the number one sort of frustration that people said , so .
32106	0	a	Cause that will solve kind of the frustration of losing it .
32107	0	a	Yep .
32108	0	a	I do not think there is anything else on the market that does that , so .
32109	0	a	Yeah .
32110	0	a	I do not really know about the voice recognition thing .
32111	0	a	I w well
32112	0	a	i
32113	0	a	Something simple .
32114	1	a	Maybe we should concentrate just on the whistle back function at the moment , and if something comes back
32115	0	a	I would go more
32116	0	a	Yeah ,
32117	0	a	f more for clap .
32118	0	a	if if our primary consideration is to get it there in time , time is short , you want something to meet the major concerns of the consumer so that we can have that as a selling point for the product , something that is quick and simple .
32119	0	a	Yeah .
32120	0	a	So ,
32121	0	a	sounds good .
32122	0	a	And that would not put off the kind of older generation either , cause everyone can whistle or clap , and they would not have to be kind of scared of this new technology .
32123	1	a	Well , so maybe a clap rather than a whistle would be
32124	0	a	On the basis that if we have got if we are catering to the whole age range , you want something that is easy to do ,
32125	0	a	now something that does not like whis
32126	0	a	Well I
32127	0	a	I
32128	0	a	I do not know .
32129	0	a	No not everyone can whistle , can they , though ?
32130	0	a	No ,
32131	0	a	clapping , I think clapping ,
32132	0	a	yeah .
32133	0	a	Well If you think that more people can whistle than clap then that is fine , then go for that option ,
32134	0	a	but if
32135	0	a	I would have thought that more people could clap rather than whistle , so so clap option .
32136	0	a	Yeah .
32137	0	a	Yeah .
32138	0	a	Okay .
32139	0	a	Kay we have already decided that we do not need a teletext button , have not we ?
32140	0	a	Is that one of the
32141	0	a	Ef effectively that is what the that is what they are saying , that if if people are now using the internet then you do not need teletext , so so take out teletext .
32142	0	a	Taking out teletext , okay .
32143	0	a	Did we decide on having the ten the ten numbers and then the the little digit next to it which kind of enabled you to put them together .
32144	0	a	Right .
32145	0	a	Yeah , I think so , so zero to nine .
32146	0	a	I think nowadays you can just get ones where it gives you a sort of a second or two to press another number , so you can press any two and it will sort of put them together .
32147	0	a	Yeah .
32148	0	a	Okay , ten numbers and then some kind of device to allow I will put delay to allow multiple numbers .
32149	0	a	Yeah .
32150	0	a	Yeah .
32151	0	a	Or multiple digits .
32152	0	a	Yeah .
32153	0	a	Did we decide anything about the other functions ?
32154	0	a	As in setting the audio and tuning it and stuff like that ?
32155	0	a	You had an had an idea about the menu ?
32156	0	a	But just thinking people probably I mean you do not have
32157	0	a	you only have to probably tune in the TV once , but you have to be able to tune it that once .
32158	1	a	we could possibly put an L a sort of a LCD menu in ,
32159	0	a	but that again is probably an expense that
32160	0	a	Yeah .
32161	0	a	So and if finally the TV breaks , you get a new one , you are going to have to be able to tune it .
32162	0	a	You ca not really avoid that .
32163	0	a	No .
32164	0	a	Except the new digital markets which do it by themselves .
32165	0	a	Yeah .
32166	0	a	So that will be in
32167	0	a	Yes .
32168	0	a	But the but that is relying on the television market changing to an automatic and if it is at the moment , that is fine .
32169	0	a	But at the moment it is not , so it seems to me that you have to have a device that caters , cause otherwise it would make it your device would become inoperable , or only operable in certain circumstances and
32170	0	a	the idea is to have an international market
32171	0	a	which is And it is also m it is
32172	0	a	the the product we have got is something that is at the I would have said the lower end of the s of the cost scale , so we are not really going for something that is terribly high tech .
32173	0	a	Yeah .
32174	0	a	Yeah .
32175	0	a	Yeah yeah .
32176	0	a	Yeah .
32177	0	a	Yeah .
32178	0	a	I s I suppose
32179	0	a	if people are buying remotes , then they are probably buying it to replace another remote cause all most tellies come with remotes , so .
32180	0	a	Possibly .
32181	0	a	I mean we are maybe talking about replacing remotes for slightly older televisions ,
32182	1	a	so we maybe need to keep the the tuning function in .
32183	0	a	That is right .
32184	0	a	Yeah .
32185	0	a	Yeah .
32186	0	a	So how would this menu function work ?
32187	1	a	Would you maybe have like one menu button , then you would use the other buttons , maybe the number buttons to actually do the separate functions .
32188	0	a	Yeah , that would be a good idea , yeah .
32189	0	a	Yeah ,
32190	1	a	like the volume or something .
32191	0	a	Okay .
32192	0	a	Yeah , cause you do need kind of brightness and contrast and everything as well .
32193	0	a	My dad was watching a film the other week and it was too dark , so I had to go through it and turn the brightness up .
32194	0	a	we are going to have the the individual numbers and then a menu function and maybe sort of a slightly more advanced instruction booklet to come with it , to guide
32195	0	a	Presu
32196	0	a	I think it would be quite hard just for people to grasp just off like the menu use different buttons
32197	1	a	you maybe have to have like some better instructions of how that would actually work .
32198	0	a	I am not sure whether the sort of having people have a booklet
32199	0	a	cause one the second most annoying thing that people found was having to learn the new one .
32200	0	a	Right , okay .
32201	1	a	So maybe next to each of the buttons , you know each of them could have a number and then also a function written next to it ,
32202	0	a	so you are basically pressing
32203	0	a	Right .
32204	0	a	that also goes back to the original design when we saw those two , and there was the one on the left hand side which had all like the double functions and stuff
32205	0	a	which kind of looked too busy and had too much on it , so .
32206	0	a	Okay .
32207	0	a	Well , if we are trying to keep it slee sleek and sexy as well , have you seen those remotes where kind of the bottom bit slides down , so there is kind of everything else revealed ?
32208	0	a	So you do not use it that much , you do not have to see it all the time .
32209	0	a	Okay , well .
32210	0	a	Yeah .
32211	0	a	So y
32212	0	a	That is a very good idea .
32213	0	a	But it is all there if you need it .
32214	0	a	That is that is a good idea actually .
32215	0	a	Yeah ,
32216	0	a	yeah .
32217	0	a	Sor sort of a second .
32218	0	a	So you keep
32219	0	a	Right we have got five minutes before we wind up this meeting , so I have been told .
32220	0	a	Like a hidden panel .
32221	0	a	Okay .
32222	0	a	I do not know if you have got the same .
32223	0	a	not quite , but I guess .
32224	0	a	Okay .
32225	0	a	So so keep keep detailed functions hidden at the back .
32226	0	a	Keep the other buttons but hide them away .
32227	0	a	And that will be better for the older generation as well cause , well my dad does not like anything that you have got to kind of flick through a menu , but he can pretty much read a button if it is displayed properly .
32228	0	a	So
32229	0	a	So we are going to have to have to work out what is going to be on these other functions as as well .
32230	0	a	Yeah .
32231	0	a	So we are going to have like two separate two separate lists , I guess .
32232	0	a	Yeah .
32233	0	a	That is right .
32234	0	a	Yeah .
32235	0	a	data functions hidden at back .
32236	0	a	So th the
32237	0	a	The detailed ones would be sort of brightness ,
32238	0	a	sorta
32239	0	a	Can bring out when needed .
32240	0	a	Yeah .
32241	0	a	That is right
32242	0	a	so we are dis
32243	0	a	So you have got which ones are going to be on the front and which ones are going to be on the back .
32244	0	a	So sh
32245	1	a	Should we decide in the next couple of minutes , and then
32246	0	a	So on the
32247	0	a	about the number .
32248	0	a	We have to decide .
32249	0	a	Yeah .
32250	0	a	I guess so .
32251	0	a	So on front ,
32252	0	a	numbers , volume .
32253	0	a	the volume up and down .
32254	1	a	And the volume ?
32255	0	a	Shall we have a mute button as well ?
32256	1	a	A mute button as well .
32257	0	a	Sorry ?
32258	0	a	Yeah .
32259	0	a	Yeah .
32260	0	a	Yeah
32261	0	a	I think they are handy .
32262	1	a	Or
32263	0	a	But then they might not buy it if they have not got one .
32264	0	a	And probably a power one as well .
32265	0	a	Dunno .
32266	0	a	I know it is probably like not an issue to raise here , but the whole thing about not using your standby because of the like waste of electricity .
32267	0	a	Have you seen the adverts ?
32268	0	a	Like if you boil the kettle that is full that is a waste .
32269	0	a	Yeah .
32270	0	a	If you leave your telly on standby it powers Blackpool for a certain amount of time .
32271	1	a	Like we should maybe try to discourage people from standby .
32272	0	a	Cause people might just be too fickle and not want to change .
32273	0	a	Yeah .
32274	0	a	Yeah , it is maybe too much of a big issue for here .
32275	0	a	Yeah .
32276	1	a	We can send out a flier with the device saying that you should not leave it on stand by .
32277	0	a	So so are you having the stand by on the front , then ?
32278	0	a	Well .
32279	0	a	Uh oh danger sign .
32280	0	a	I think you probably should .
32281	0	a	Yeah ,
32282	1	a	but a little bit smaller .
32283	1	a	Compromise .
32284	0	a	Okay .
32285	0	a	are we going to have the channel up and down as well as the number buttons ?
32286	0	a	Okay , so we will have
32287	0	a	So we have got ten eleven
32288	0	a	twelve
32289	0	a	thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen there ?
32290	0	a	Is there anything else ?
32291	0	a	cause yeah the market research said there is quite a lot of people do just zap around and flick , so .
32292	0	a	Right .
32293	0	a	Channel up and down .
32294	0	a	What else have we got ?
32295	0	a	What was that , sixteen ?
32296	0	a	Volume button .
32297	0	a	Numbers is ten , volume is twelve ,
32298	0	a	th
32299	0	a	Yeah si
32300	0	a	One up , one down .
32301	0	a	How many volumes ?
32302	0	a	Right okay .
32303	0	a	On mute .
32304	0	a	And a mute , yeah .
32305	0	a	That is sixteen is not it , yeah .
32306	0	a	I do not think so , no .
32307	0	a	Power button , stand by , channel , up and down .
32308	0	a	So is that it ?
32309	0	a	Okay .
32310	0	a	so .
32311	0	a	That is sixteen buttons , you reckon .
32312	0	a	And then at the back ?
32313	0	a	Okay .
32314	0	a	You have got brightness and contrast .
32315	1	a	Maybe if we are going to run out of time , one of us should come up with a list of these and then get back at the next meeting just at the start and say what they are going to be .
32316	0	a	And then
32317	0	a	Yeah .
32318	0	a	So on the back it will have brightness , contrast ,
32319	0	a	anything else ?
32320	0	a	You are also going to have the channel tuner , as it were .
32321	0	a	there is audio functions .
32322	0	a	Yeah .
32323	0	a	So tuner up and down , I guess .
32324	0	a	Yeah .
32325	0	a	Tuner , would that have up and down ? .
32326	0	a	up Tune one way , tune the o
32327	0	a	I
32328	0	a	I
32329	0	a	dunno
32330	0	a	I dunno possibly .
32331	0	a	I think they normally do .
32332	0	a	okay .
32333	0	a	Yeah .
32334	0	a	Yeah .
32335	0	a	Okay .
32336	1	a	And then maybe sort of an enter button for sort of s you know , saying that you want that particular thing tuned in .
32337	1	a	So you go up and down and then it pick it finds something
32338	1	a	and then you want to press enter to select it ,
32339	1	a	yeah .
32340	0	a	Oh yeah
32341	1	a	and th and a enter button just to select .
32342	0	a	Yeah , okay .
32343	0	a	I guess we are keeping s it simple .
32344	0	a	We do not really need any other audio funct functions because it is just volume up , volume down .
32345	0	a	up volume , yeah , I would have thought so .
32346	0	a	Yeah .
32347	0	a	So I think there is quite a lot of like Dolby surround studio , surround sort of things .
32348	0	a	Yeah .
32349	0	a	Okay .
32350	0	a	Do they have their own do they have their own controls on their actual products , then , or do you have to do it via the remote ?
32351	0	a	Yeah I suppose if we have got their if they have got their own controls then we can avoid it for ours just to keep it simple .
32352	0	a	maybe for the younger market .
32353	0	a	I think they have got their own controls in this kind of like hidden panel .
32354	0	a	Yeah .
32355	0	a	Yeah .
32356	0	a	Oh no , I mean like there is kind of individual buttons for them , like on the TV remote .
32357	0	a	Oh , okay .
32358	0	a	Right .
32359	0	a	But I do not really know what they are for , I have never used them .
32360	0	a	I just know they are something to do with Dolby .
32361	0	a	Maybe unless something comes up then we should I think
32362	1	a	Well shall we look into that and just get back together .
32363	0	a	Well you might get some research .
32364	0	a	Okay .
32365	0	a	Okay .
32366	1	a	Right so I will do the minutes of this meeting .
32367	0	a	Right .
32368	0	a	And we will meet back at I am not sure .
32369	0	a	forty minutes , I believe is the time .
32370	0	a	 
32371	0	a	Okay .
32372	0	a	Right .
32373	0	a	Conceptual design meeting .
32374	0	a	Right .
32375	0	a	Okay , so
32376	0	a	Right well from the last meeting I was trying to send you the minutes , but it did not work out too well ,
32377	1	a	so maybe in sort of quick summary of the last meeting , I can quickly give you what we what we had .
32378	0	a	right , so
32379	0	a	Wishing I had not closed the damn
32380	0	a	Right so we had the fact that we are going to have the the logo the company logo in its colour scheme incorporated onto the the device the remote device .
32381	0	a	We had made our decisions about made our decisions about the device itself , that it was going to be simple to make it enable us to complete the project in time .
32382	0	a	We are going to have effectively two pages , a front page which had the features that the the customers most wanted , and then the the backup features on the second page so that it could meet the technical requirements .
32383	0	a	And the customers would not have to look at them too often , only as and when required .
32384	0	a	So .
32385	0	a	So basically what decisions have we made ?
32386	0	a	have there been any changes ?
32387	0	a	Right .
32388	0	a	I think we all have a presentation again ,
32389	1	a	so if we go through those and then
32390	0	a	Yeah .
32391	0	a	Three presentation , yeah .
32392	1	a	Shall I go first again ?
32393	1	a	I see this a little more smoothly than the last one .
32394	0	a	So
32395	0	a	Yeah , fine .
32396	0	a	Okay .
32397	0	a	Okay right , let is get started .
32398	0	a	basically the for the
32399	0	a	I will back actually .
32400	0	a	For the components design , next step is
32401	0	a	basically the the way the remote is going to work is still the same idea as before .
32402	0	a	We still have the user interface which is all the buttons we are going to incorporate .
32403	0	a	Then there is a chip and still the sender .
32404	0	a	So yes including the power s supply as well .
32405	0	a	I will go on to my findings in each of these areas .
32406	0	a	first in the power supply , we have the option of just the standard battery ,
32407	0	a	There is a dynamo .
32408	0	a	Any of you think of kind of like the the old torches which you wind up
32409	0	a	There is a kinetic option , which if any of you have seen those new watches which you kind of you power up by waving around , it just requires a small amount of movement which would mean the batteries would not have to be replaced .
32410	0	a	that is one option , but I think that was going to cost a little more .
32411	0	a	And then there is solar cells .
32412	0	a	as a final option .
32413	0	a	For the buttons , we have an integrated push button ,
32414	0	a	which is
32415	0	a	Oh just to say all all these are supplied by Real Reaction .
32416	0	a	So I guess for the ease of for quickness and ease we should take them from at least like one of these options .
32417	0	a	so for the buttons there is an integrated push button , which I guess is just the same as the standard ones .
32418	0	a	Okay .
32419	0	a	This says it is similar to the button on the mouse for a normal for like like modern computer .
32420	0	a	there is a scroll wheel which is you know the new mouse has just got like the centre section which you can scroll up and down ,
32421	1	a	which may be for the volume .
32422	0	a	You could do do that .
32423	0	a	one issue for the buttons is , depending on which material we use , if we use rubber buttons then it requires a rubber case , so we have to take that into consideration .
32424	0	a	moving on to the printed s that is on the next
32425	0	a	I th
32426	0	a	I think the there was not too much difference in the cost , that that related to the actual buttons , but it does affect the printed circuit board .
32427	0	a	What would be the cost do do we know ?
32428	0	a	which is the next section .
32429	0	a	Basically for the circuit board which is the middle , it is just see it down there the chips like the like the workings of the actual of the remote .
32430	0	a	The firm supplies a simple , a regular and an advanced circuit board .
32431	0	a	And there is different prices according to each .
32432	0	a	So if we have got the scroll wheel for one of the buttons , that would require a slightly more advanced circuit board than if we just had a standard push button .
32433	0	a	one final thing we came up with was some information on the speech recognition .
32434	0	a	There is a small unit available through the company which obviously would be an extra cost , but it would not affect the size of the remote too much .
32435	0	a	and I guess that would require a more advanced circuit board , so there is an extra price in that sense .
32436	0	a	There is th sorry an extra cost in that sense .
32437	0	a	going to my personal preferences , I thought possibly for power we could use kinetic which is the idea of the watches that you move you move the remote around to power it up .
32438	0	a	And this would avoid batteries running out , having to replace batteries and such like .
32439	0	a	for the buttons , I thought we would probably get away with just having the standard push buttons rather than the scroll wheel .
32440	0	a	and for the circuit board , again depends on which features we want in the actual in the remote .
32441	0	a	So if we wanted the scroll wheel and wanted the voice recognition , then we would have to get a a more costly circuit board .
32442	0	a	And that is it .
32443	0	a	Kay .
32444	0	a	Thanks .
32445	0	a	with the printed circuit boards you were going for the
32446	0	a	i it kind of depends if we are going to have the speech recognition , we would have to probably get an advanced one .
32447	0	a	I am guessing .
32448	0	a	but I do not know ,
32449	1	a	so that is something I will have to look into .
32450	0	a	But are we going f R
32451	0	a	right .
32452	0	a	that is a that is a decision for all of us .
32453	1	a	So are we able to make that decision now in a sense that this is the point at which we are discussing that issue ,
32454	0	a	so would it not be best to rather than
32455	1	a	I mean one way is to do each of the presentations and then make decisions going back to the various presentations as they were .
32456	0	a	Yeah yeah .
32457	0	a	We decide .
32458	0	a	Yeah .
32459	1	a	The other way would be to do the presentation and then make the decision at that point in time .
32460	0	a	Yeah , that is probably a better one , to discuss it straight away .
32461	0	a	Maybe w
32462	0	a	Cause at that point then you have got the details up there , so if we wanted to know for instance that the scroll wheel required the regular and what required advance .
32463	0	a	Then if we were able to see that down then we could make the decision at that point in time and then that would be the end of that issue .
32464	0	a	Does that make sense ?
32465	0	a	Yes .
32466	0	a	I have a lot of the information there .
32467	0	a	It might not be very clear .
32468	0	a	Is there
32469	1	a	Unless you want to plug it back in to yours .
32470	0	a	We could do , yeah .
32471	0	a	yeah we should .
32472	0	a	As I say it only specified that we need a more advanced circuit board for the scroll wheel ,
32473	0	a	it did not
32474	0	a	The voice recognition came as a separate piece of information .
32475	0	a	No
32476	0	a	the scroll wheel required the regular ,
32477	0	a	so the
32478	0	a	Yeah
32479	0	a	if if you down .
32480	0	a	It is just this bit at the bottom which I have highlighted , but the scroll wheel requires a mini m minimally a regular chip , which is in the higher price range .
32481	0	a	Okay .
32482	0	a	I think the scroll wheel
32483	0	a	Yeah , and if we are going for sleek and sexy , I think a scroll wheel is maybe a bit kind of bulky ?
32484	0	a	I I have got pictures
32485	0	a	well I have seen pictures with it kind of sticking off the side of it , and they do not really look great .
32486	0	a	The display requires an advanced chip the display requires an advanced chip which in turn is more expense .
32487	0	a	Also the display is for something else which we decided against .
32488	0	a	but that bit
32489	0	a	And note that the push button just requires a simple chip , so that would keep the price down .
32490	0	a	Okay .
32491	0	a	Down .
32492	0	a	Right .
32493	0	a	Kay .
32494	0	a	Okay .
32495	1	a	So maybe just a simple push button ,
32496	0	a	and that would cut costs on the
32497	0	a	Did everyone get this on the speech recognition ?
32498	0	a	The
32499	0	a	it was basically what we said before , the idea that you record in a set message , and then it picks up that message and replies to you .
32500	0	a	So .
32501	0	a	So we are going for p Okay .
32502	0	a	So is
32503	0	a	Simple push button .
32504	0	a	So are we going for the w
32505	0	a	are we going for the simple one , are we ?
32506	0	a	Okay .
32507	0	a	Yeah , a simple pushbuttons .
32508	0	a	Yeah .
32509	0	a	So it is basically the concept we discussed before .
32510	0	a	but then we do not know for sure whether it would require a more complicated circuit board .
32511	0	a	I am guessing it would , but got like the definite information .
32512	1	a	Maybe we should go on what we are certain of rather than
32513	0	a	if it is just the push button then it just needs the simple circuit board .
32514	0	a	So if we go for the simple push button , so effectively we are going for the simple printed circuit board are we ?
32515	0	a	Or are we going for the regular ?
32516	0	a	Mm mm .
32517	0	a	But is there any other
32518	0	a	I mean okay , that is true for the for for that element , but we have to take all el elements into consideration .
32519	0	a	And so if there is one element that requires the more expensive one , or say the regular one , or the more advanced , then that would have to be the same for all of them .
32520	0	a	S
32521	0	a	Right .
32522	1	a	I suppose we need we need to find out what circuit board that requires , maybe before we m make a decision .
32523	0	a	But
32524	0	a	But the way that I interpret that it does not seem to send out a signal to the telly ,
32525	0	a	it just
32526	0	a	it is like a parrot just rep reply replying to your message .
32527	0	a	Oh yeah ,
32528	0	a	I suppose so , yeah .
32529	1	a	So maybe that would be something separate , yeah .
32530	0	a	So I do not think it would effect our circuit board .
32531	0	a	Yeah .
32532	0	a	No .
32533	0	a	Okay ,
32534	0	a	so we would have a simple circuit board and that would be an extra that would be in addition to it .
32535	0	a	Yeah .
32536	0	a	Yeah .
32537	0	a	And I do not think you could really perform any of the remote functions with it .
32538	0	a	Oh that makes sense .
32539	0	a	Cause the example that they have given there is good morning coffee machine , good morning Jo .
32540	0	a	Mm mm .
32541	0	a	It might be useful to say like where are you remote .
32542	0	a	Okay .
32543	0	a	Here I am , Jo .
32544	0	a	Yeah .
32545	0	a	But I think that is maybe as far as that one could go ?
32546	0	a	Yeah ,
32547	0	a	just as a fun way to find it .
32548	0	a	Okay .
32549	0	a	Yeah .
32550	0	a	Yeah that makes sense ,
32551	0	a	so we would stick with the simple circuit board and then think of the speech recognition as an extra an extra possibility .
32552	0	a	Okay .
32553	0	a	Simple circuit board .
32554	0	a	Simple push button .
32555	0	a	Okay .
32556	0	a	W w kinetic .
32557	0	a	And it says that
32558	0	a	I think it said the cost of that is not too much .
32559	0	a	You were you were wanting to go for the kinetic power supply .
32560	0	a	yeah
32561	0	a	I I thought so just for just for ease of not having to replace the batteries .
32562	0	a	And how does it get charged up ?
32563	0	a	Okay .
32564	0	a	It is I think it works on the basis
32565	0	a	they have some kind of ball bearings inside .
32566	0	a	It is it is some on watches which you you kind of you shake to power it up .
32567	0	a	Somehow the mechanism inside powers up through movement .
32568	0	a	So you would you would move the remote around a little bit and then that powers it up to use it .
32569	0	a	Okay .
32570	0	a	Yeah .
32571	0	a	So the speech recognition was
32572	0	a	Are we going for speech recognition ?
32573	0	a	No ?
32574	1	a	Cause that required the advanced
32575	0	a	I had speech recognition requires advanced
32576	0	a	req require
32577	0	a	Oh .
32578	0	a	I think it would be helpful to find it ,
32579	0	a	but I do not think it would
32580	0	a	Yeah , I think so .
32581	0	a	Just
32582	0	a	Just just for the call and find thing .
32583	0	a	yeah I think
32584	0	a	did we decide it did not affect the circuit board , it just affected
32585	0	a	It was just
32586	0	a	Oh no
32587	0	a	th that is what that is what I thought , but maybe maybe it does not .
32588	0	a	I think I might have got that wrong .
32589	0	a	Cause it is s it is separate is not it ,
32590	0	a	it is not part of the
32591	0	a	So okay .
32592	0	a	Speech recognition you reckon then is s simple .
32593	0	a	It is it is just an addition thing
32594	0	a	it is
32595	0	a	yeah .
32596	0	a	And so we would want it in as an extra because it does not appear to cost too much .
32597	0	a	Would that be
32598	0	a	In fact , it would not really cost anymore , would it ?
32599	0	a	And then have to change all change everything at the last minute .
32600	0	a	Kay .
32601	0	a	Kay
32602	0	a	shall I pass on to you now ?
32603	0	a	I assume it would cost extra ,
32604	1	a	but Maybe we maybe we will find out how much that does cost and have to decide slightly later .
32605	0	a	I think
32606	1	a	I will just just check what it said .
32607	0	a	Actually I do not think it really says anything about the cost , but it says that it is already in the coffee machines , so like it is already kind of
32608	0	a	Yeah .
32609	0	a	Okay .
32610	0	a	S
32611	0	a	Sorry ?
32612	0	a	Yeah ,
32613	0	a	I have found that try and get it back .
32614	0	a	Oh , that was quick .
32615	0	a	okay , so very brief presentation , .
32616	0	a	From looking at the remotes that are out there at the minute , none of them are particularly sleek and sexy .
32617	0	a	I have not actually got the examples of the scroll button there , but there is some curved cases that you can see , a range of sizes .
32618	0	a	All of them have a lot of buttons there they seem to just have the rubber buttons .
32619	0	a	Does that move it ?
32620	0	a	It just seems to be skipping on without us doing anything .
32621	1	a	If you right click and then go onto a previous slide .
32622	0	a	it is alright .
32623	0	a	Okay , right .
32624	0	a	There was not much more to say about that , just rambling .
32625	0	a	some of the remotes that I looked at , one of the models da did actually have voice recognition where you could where it was connected to the remote control functions .
32626	0	a	And it was quite a swish model , where it can control four devices , TV , cable , satellite , video , DVD , audio .
32627	0	a	so that is a bit of competition there .
32628	0	a	So
32629	1	a	I mean maybe it is better not to try and compete with that sort of thing and just to market it as a completely different like different viewpoint as a kind of finding your lost control rather than trying to compete with the functions .
32630	0	a	Yeah ,
32631	0	a	yeah .
32632	0	a	the scroll buttons , as you have already mentioned , there is examples of those , but they do not look as sleek as other models .
32633	0	a	And there is no real advantage and because it impacts on other on the materials and the price it is not great .
32634	0	a	On the price , yeah .
32635	0	a	So you were saying the scroll buttons
32636	0	a	Yeah .
32637	0	a	Th there was a specialist type of remote that we could think about , .
32638	0	a	There was children is remote , where they just had a very limited range of buttons and they were b bright and colourful and you you could program them so that they could only look at certain channels .
32639	0	a	Kay .
32640	0	a	but I do not know if that is really in our field ?
32641	0	a	But that is something that is out there .
32642	0	a	I guess I guess we are going for the biggest market , maybe not ,
32643	0	a	but Was it was it specified that we went for the biggest ?
32644	1	a	So maybe the children is remote should be like a a next step ,
32645	0	a	but maybe I dunno for ours , maybe
32646	0	a	we should
32647	0	a	Yeah .
32648	0	a	Well we are to go for the international market rather than a local market but that that would not necessarily preclude The one thing that you can often do with products is you can make small modifications .
32649	0	a	So you have your basic model which you would sell at whatever , and then you could have additional features
32650	0	a	in you know like a
32651	0	a	You would have model one , model two and model three , and therefore you can sub divide your market up .
32652	0	a	But that is really where your field is .
32653	0	a	Anyway you could add on for an extra package , but on this basic one I am reckoning that we are going for the basic model to be discussed here and that you would have for future reference the possibility of adding in extra features at extra cost to take care of specialist market segments .
32654	0	a	Okay .
32655	0	a	Right well that is something that we can be aware of .
32656	0	a	Is that
32657	0	a	So so what are we deciding to do here ?
32658	0	a	Right .
32659	0	a	I think because there is already very good voice recognition technology out there , and because ours might not cover the same functions that the leading brands do , it might be a good idea to market it as a finder function .
32660	0	a	the fi
32661	0	a	Yeah ,
32662	0	a	the finder function rather than as a speech function to find your remote .
32663	0	a	Yeah .
32664	0	a	So you also said for going for the international market that some some maybe older people might not like the speech recognition .
32665	0	a	Okay .
32666	0	a	Oh yeah .
32667	0	a	S s so
32668	0	a	Yeah ,
32669	0	a	yeah .
32670	0	a	Different languages might not be compatible .
32671	0	a	It w it would make it quite complicated , where ours at least keeps it fairly simple
32672	0	a	and then the
32673	0	a	Yeah ,
32674	0	a	yeah .
32675	0	a	Yeah , cause I think you program this one yourself , like to say like whatever you want to your question .
32676	0	a	Yeah and ours is quite a cheap device ,
32677	0	a	so I do not know how much we will be able to put into it .
32678	0	a	Yeah .
32679	0	a	Yeah .
32680	0	a	So you would have a finder feature rather than a voice recognition feature .
32681	0	a	Maybe
32682	0	a	unless something else comes up .
32683	0	a	And you were talking
32684	0	a	And you were talking about scroll buttons ?
32685	0	a	Okay .
32686	0	a	yeah
32687	0	a	I think I think we have decided that it is going to increase the cost and give no real kind of extra benefit and it is going to decrease from the sleekness of it .
32688	0	a	Yeah .
32689	0	a	b
32690	0	a	Alright , so we are just going to have the the rubber buttons ,
32691	0	a	was that right ?
32692	0	a	Okay .
32693	0	a	Yes yes .
32694	0	a	and just to be aware that there are kind of specialist functions and specialist remotes
32695	0	a	but we probably do not want to focus on those like such as
32696	0	a	the children is remote .
32697	0	a	So not to be focused on .
32698	0	a	Yeah .
32699	0	a	there was a mention just as kind of a warning about button design .
32700	0	a	just to avoid ambiguity .
32701	0	a	So it gave the example of say your volume buttons for up and down , they might both have a V on for volume ,
32702	1	a	let is think how they did this .
32703	0	a	Good in in Flip
32704	0	a	it round in ninety degree a hundred and eighty degrees and have it up and down .
32705	1	a	I am just going to check
32706	1	a	so I do this right .
32707	0	a	An upside down V .
32708	0	a	So that would show that volume was going up , whereas the one underneath would see the volume going down .
32709	0	a	What did they say ?
32710	0	a	I think the thing was that if you decide to do this , to have triangular buttons , somebody might look at this one and say oh well this triangular button is pointing up , and that is the first thing that they see
32711	0	a	Actually that ca not be right , can it ?
32712	0	a	Oh well , no ,
32713	0	a	they might see yeah
32714	0	a	, they might see this pointing down and think right that is going to turn the volume down , whereas the actual button is pointing up , so the function is to turn the button up .
32715	0	a	Right .
32716	0	a	So , be careful what you put on the buttons and be careful of the shape that you make them , because they might be kind of two contradicting kind of shapes .
32717	0	a	So maybe we could have like
32718	0	a	Yeah .
32719	0	a	Yeah I
32720	0	a	I know what you mean .
32721	1	a	So maybe we could have volume written on the side
32722	0	a	and then up and down on the on the buttons themselves .
32723	0	a	Yeah .
32724	0	a	Yeah .
32725	0	a	You could have volume up and volume
32726	1	a	Volume up , down and Like that .
32727	0	a	Possible .
32728	0	a	And cause the idea was to have limited
32729	0	a	it was to have sizable amount of information on it .
32730	0	a	Yeah yeah .
32731	0	a	Limited number of buttons .
32732	0	a	Yeah .
32733	0	a	Cause it was sixteen buttons , was not it that were
32734	0	a	Okay .
32735	0	a	Yeah
32736	0	a	we got it down to not too many .
32737	0	a	and I think that is all I had to say for that .
32738	0	a	Okay .
32739	0	a	so what was the decision on the design of the volume button ?
32740	0	a	Oh okay .
32741	0	a	Are we are we going to go through the design of all the buttons at the moment ,
32742	0	a	or are we going to t
32743	0	a	Yeah , maybe we should see yours first .
32744	0	a	I have I have got some things to say about possible design things from trend watching .
32745	0	a	Cool .
32746	0	a	Right , I have been looking at some trends in in sort of basically fashion on top of doing the research into the remote control market the the one that is the one I talked about last time , that we would sort of asked people about remote controls and what what was good about them , what was bad , what they used .
32747	0	a	And we have also been looking at sort of fa sort of fashions and what people are wanting out of consumer goods at the moment .
32748	0	a	So we have had people in Paris and Milan watching the fashion trends .
32749	0	a	You know yourself .
32750	0	a	So
32751	0	a	So just to summarise the most important things which came out of the remote control market investigation .
32752	0	a	The most important thing was that the thing sort of look and felt fancy rather than just functional .
32753	0	a	Kay .
32754	0	a	And second , there should be some technological innovation .
32755	0	a	And then third and l less important than the other two , there should be an ease of use as well .
32756	0	a	And apparently , the fashion trends are that people want sort of clothes and shoes and things with a fruit and vegetables theme .
32757	0	a	but the feel of the material should be spongy , which is contrary to last year , apparently .
32758	0	a	I presume it must have been not not spongy last year .
32759	0	a	So
32760	0	a	we need to emphasise the fancy design with on on our remote control above all else .
32761	0	a	And then also try and add in technological informat innovation
32762	1	a	which could be our sort of find the thing with a hand clap .
32763	0	a	And then we need to ma sort of make it easy to use that is as a third priority ,
32764	1	a	so perhaps fewer fewer buttons and functions as we have as we have discussed .
32765	0	a	And then maybe find a way to incorporate these trends so that we sort of capture people is imaginations .
32766	1	a	So maybe we could make the buttons shaped like fruit and veg , or the the buttons could be spongy , somehow .
32767	1	a	Maybe we could make them out of rubber rather than sort of hard plastic .
32768	1	a	And then sort of even wackier than that , we could maybe have a fruit or vegetable shaped remote ,
32769	0	a	say in the shape of a banana or something like that .
32770	0	a	Right , so that will be it .
32771	1	a	Maybe a banana or courgette or something .
32772	0	a	How how far we actually want to go along and sort of follow the trends , do we think the trends are particularly important for this type of gadget , or or you know , do they not matter that much ?
32773	0	a	Yeah .
32774	0	a	I think if you start making the buttons fruit shaped , it might make it more complicated to use .
32775	0	a	Well you were just talking about you have got to be careful how you shape your buttons , cause you are can mis direct people .
32776	0	a	And I would have thought the functionality cause the people get cheesed off by things by having to read instructions et cetera , so .
32777	0	a	Yeah .
32778	1	a	Maybe just one button ,
32779	0	a	say the standby button is quite kind of separate from all the other functions .
32780	1	a	Maybe that could be a little apple .
32781	0	a	And then that would not get in the way of like kind of one to nine , and it would not confuse the numbers .
32782	0	a	Okay .
32783	0	a	Maybe yeah .
32784	0	a	Now ?
32785	0	a	Yeah .
32786	0	a	Stand by button .
32787	0	a	No
32788	0	a	th that that incorporates the trend whilst at the same time not confusing people , if you are looking for functionality .
32789	0	a	Well I dunno
32790	0	a	I I guess maybe fruit and vegetables may be popular at the moment , but as we know how fickle the fashion markets are ,
32791	0	a	maybe
32792	0	a	I mean it just seems realistic that the remote control market is not the kind of thing which takes in those kinds of fashion trends .
32793	0	a	But what are they going to be next
32794	0	a	Yeah .
32795	0	a	What are they going to be next year .
32796	0	a	Yeah yeah .
32797	0	a	But but th but okay
32798	0	a	but you you can incorporate the tr
32799	0	a	If y if you change all the buttons then you have got the problem that this year is fruit and veg , next year is I was going to say animals or elephants or w whatever .
32800	0	a	S
32801	1	a	But I suppose as long as it is quite a subtle design ,
32802	0	a	even if the design kind of changes , It seems like you are going to have rubber cases , as well as buttons .
32803	0	a	Yeah ,
32804	0	a	I am not
32805	0	a	Yeah .
32806	0	a	That means you are constantly changing your production schedule , and you have gotta make different moulds and everything else ,
32807	0	a	so that is not a good idea I would I would suggest .
32808	0	a	I am not I am not sure what what what the sort of timescale we are thinking of selling the product over is .
32809	0	a	I do not know .
32810	0	a	Yeah ,
32811	0	a	yeah .
32812	0	a	to something which is maybe more universal .
32813	0	a	Well d d
32814	0	a	But if
32815	1	a	We c maybe can imply a fruit shape possibly .
32816	1	a	Maybe the spongy feel is something we could think about , .
32817	0	a	Well .
32818	0	a	Yep .
32819	1	a	Maybe still with a rubber design
32820	1	a	we could
32821	0	a	Was that in the sort of fashion sense that this
32822	0	a	Or was the spongy feel was that sort of fashion ?
32823	0	a	It was , was not it ?
32824	0	a	So the
32825	0	a	Yeah .
32826	0	a	Yeah .
32827	0	a	Yeah .
32828	0	a	And that you can make them curved or double curved and that would be the kind of sleek and sexy look .
32829	0	a	Oh yeah yeah
32830	0	a	one of the things were if you had rubber buttons then you had to have a rubber case .
32831	0	a	Oh right ,
32832	0	a	that fits , does not it ?
32833	0	a	Right .
32834	0	a	oh no no no
32835	0	a	sorry
32836	0	a	it is if you use the rubber double curved case then you must use rubber buttons .
32837	0	a	That is the way round .
32838	0	a	If you have the rubber case then you have to have the rubber buttons to go with it .
32839	0	a	Which makes sense .
32840	0	a	Rubber buttons require rubber case .
32841	0	a	And that would fit in with what we want , would not it , for the spongy feel , to have everything rubber .
32842	0	a	so , yeah .
32843	0	a	The m the main problem is how f how frequently do the fashions change ?
32844	0	a	Cause in essence in the production you want things to stay you want to basically mint them out cause if you have got fashion changes and that you are incorporating , then it means that your stock is is last year is stock and therefore you are selling it or having to sell it at a discounted rate which you would not want to do .
32845	0	a	Yeah .
32846	0	a	Whereas if you kept the product the same but you could have a difference from year to year , it seems to me that you could incorporate a fashion statement if you like , rather than changing the whole kit and caboodle .
32847	0	a	Okay .
32848	0	a	Yeah .
32849	0	a	Yeah .
32850	1	a	You are just changing one aspect like like the standby button or something like that ,
32851	0	a	and especially cause then you could make it something that
32852	0	a	Well , you might be limited in space , that yes .
32853	0	a	I suppose we maybe are limited in the fact that we still have to put the logo on the actual
32854	0	a	would or not .
32855	0	a	Yeah .
32856	0	a	Well you two are obviously going to find that out fairly quickly when you move over to your kit modelling stage as to how much pl how much how much how pliable is Plasticine .
32857	0	a	Yes yes .
32858	1	a	Maybe we could think of the the cases like changing with the fashions
32859	0	a	like the Nokia phones where you could take the casing off the outside .
32860	0	a	But whether that would be too much to incorporate in production , whether that would just increase the costs , make it more complicated .
32861	0	a	That is possibly it .
32862	0	a	So you are talking there about changing changing the casing .
32863	0	a	Yeah
32864	0	a	the a the actual the sort of the look from the outside , so where the buttons would stay the same , and the general function of the remote would stay the same , but you could change the the way it looked .
32865	0	a	Yeah
32866	0	a	and then you could have
32867	0	a	Oh but you still would have to have the logo on every new case ,
32868	1	a	but you could have like pink cases for girls and red ones and things like that .
32869	0	a	Yeah , that is true .
32870	0	a	Yeah
32871	0	a	you you could do a colour change ,
32872	0	a	so therefore you would
32873	0	a	yeah yeah
32874	0	a	I mean that is effectively what they did with the with the mobile phones , was to have some in blue , some in red , some in rather than all in black or , you know , which four do you want , as long as it is black ?
32875	0	a	But so
32876	0	a	Yes oh that is true
32877	0	a	that might no
32878	0	a	Well not necessarily ,
32879	0	a	because you could have your company
32880	0	a	We are we are meant to be finishing up .
32881	0	a	Yeah .
32882	0	a	So it is a possibility , .
32883	0	a	But we are supposed to use the company colour scheme , are not we ?
32884	0	a	We have not really seen that yet
32885	0	a	It might
32886	1	a	and we might be able to do both
32887	0	a	but it might clash with certain things .
32888	0	a	Oh okay yes
32889	0	a	that is
32890	0	a	Yeah .
32891	0	a	You could have your company badge and logo .
32892	0	a	I mean a lot of computers for instance like like on the one you have got there , it actually has a sort of stick on badge
32893	0	a	so what you would al all you would really need , whether it
32894	0	a	, you know , whether the casing be w any colour , could be any colour , but that badge would then have to stick out on top of it so that in a sense , with a with a logo like that , because it is on a white background , the only colour that it might not stick out so well on would be a white casing .
32895	0	a	Cause you
32896	0	a	you know you are
32897	0	a	sort of you are badging it .
32898	0	a	And in fact a lot of companies get somebody else to make them and literally just badge them themselves with their own badge over the top .
32899	0	a	And in fact the way they have got that there even if you had that on a white , which is the predominant colour of the the Windows badge , you would still be able to see it clearly from you know a white casing product .
32900	0	a	Yeah .
32901	0	a	So .
32902	1	a	And whether we would have a big enough market to have this kind of like secondary market of selling the cases might be something to consider .
32903	0	a	Well if it is for young people , like the phone generation , that sort of thing would probably go down well , and the market research has been on that side of things , has not it ?
32904	0	a	Okay , so
32905	0	a	if we just went for one colour of a rubber case
32906	0	a	Did we decide on the rubber case ?
32907	0	a	The spongy feel ,
32908	0	a	or did we think that that might go as a trend ?
32909	0	a	we have not really talked about the curvature of the case .
32910	0	a	Yeah .
32911	0	a	Yeah .
32912	0	a	Yeah ,
32913	0	a	I mean it is
32914	0	a	people say that it is the look , they want the fancy looking thing
32915	0	a	but I am
32916	0	a	Yeah .
32917	0	a	I am not convinced on whether having changeable covers would be something that people would buy into .
32918	0	a	I think with the mobiles , it is the , you know it is a communication device , people see you with it all about and
32919	0	a	i if it
32920	0	a	Yeah .
32921	0	a	Yeah I suppose ,
32922	0	a	where you you keep the remote hidden under the sofa most of the time .
32923	0	a	It is in in the house , is not it ,
32924	0	a	I suppose .
32925	0	a	I think
32926	0	a	So do not change case .
32927	0	a	Change case colour .
32928	0	a	And we are sort of saying no to that .
32929	0	a	Well , it was different last year .
32930	0	a	The trend was different last year apparently .
32931	0	a	It was not not spongy feel .
32932	0	a	But
32933	0	a	I do not know whether the trend will change .
32934	0	a	I do not know whether it is one of those things that like sort of having all fruit shaped keys , that that probably would go out of fashion very quickly , whereas just the fact that it was a rubber case is probably less less of something that y you are going to end up hating in a year , you know .
32935	0	a	Yeah .
32936	0	a	Yeah , less likely to
32937	0	a	So then th th
32938	0	a	that would
32939	0	a	Yeah .
32940	0	a	Sounds reasonable .
32941	0	a	If you are going for fashion trends like that they will need t
32942	0	a	you would have to have interchangeable cases
32943	0	a	so that you could
32944	0	a	or cause otherwise someone is going to have to buy a complete new remote rather than just a case .
32945	0	a	Yeah .
32946	0	a	it seems to make sense that we we would just maybe stick with the standard rubber case , and then have the standard rubber buttons as well .
32947	0	a	Okay .
32948	0	a	Okay .
32949	0	a	There is flat , there is single curved and there is double curved .
32950	0	a	I am not exactly sure what these things look like .
32951	0	a	Mayb
32952	1	a	Maybe curves give it like the slightly more aesthetic feel ?
32953	0	a	But the double curve would not require us to perform miracles with the Plasticine .
32954	0	a	Well it says that
32955	0	a	I am not exactly sure .
32956	0	a	When you say d when you say double curved , what what exactly does that mean ?
32957	0	a	Okay .
32958	1	a	I will show you the remotes that I have got .
32959	0	a	See how
32960	1	a	Let is just get that bigger .
32961	0	a	See how the one
32962	0	a	Oh I am not plugged in , am I ?
32963	0	a	That does not help .
32964	0	a	No
32965	0	a	you are not connected to me anymore .
32966	0	a	One one thing to cons
32967	0	a	one thing to consider is that in some ways you want by having a fairly standard case it means they can all fit together on top of each other therefore for storage purposes in shops and the like and it makes it easier that you can if you can store them up on top of each other .
32968	0	a	Shall I just turn it round for time ?
32969	0	a	That should come up .
32970	0	a	Whereas if you do fancy things with it , you then gotta put it in a ca a a packaging box that that does that .
32971	0	a	And the cost of packaging could be quite important vis a vis the total cost of the product .
32972	0	a	Yeah yeah .
32973	1	a	So shall we go through quickly and just work out what we have decide on ,
32974	0	a	if we have to kind of
32975	0	a	Kay ,
32976	1	a	so shall we quickly
32977	0	a	We will go for single curve , yeah .
32978	0	a	So but
32979	0	a	No .
32980	0	a	Yeah .
32981	0	a	it is not very clear up there ,
32982	0	a	but you can see some of them have got kind of bulges , like the second one and the end one where there is a curve there .
32983	0	a	yep .
32984	0	a	Right .
32985	0	a	I am not exactl
32986	1	a	I do not know if a double curve is maybe it comes up slightly , or ?
32987	0	a	But it is a kind of sleeker look if you have got curves in there .
32988	0	a	That is what I was trying to work out .
32989	0	a	Oh right .
32990	0	a	Shall we
32991	0	a	Yeah .
32992	0	a	S so do you want to go for curves , more curves ?
32993	0	a	We are meant to be f we are meant to be finishing this meeting in about a minute or so .
32994	0	a	Definitely a single , maybe a double .
32995	0	a	Shall we go for single curve , just to compromise ?
32996	0	a	Yeah .
32997	0	a	Okay .
32998	0	a	Okay ,
32999	0	a	curved or double curved ?
33000	0	a	So it is single curved .
33001	0	a	Single curve .
33002	0	a	So did we did we decide on the kinetic power supply ?
33003	0	a	The one you move around ?
33004	0	a	Okay .
33005	0	a	Yeah I think that think that is a good idea .
33006	0	a	Yep .
33007	0	a	Oh we ca
33008	0	a	Yeah yeah ,
33009	0	a	we will still have the
33010	0	a	Are we going to go for the simple circuit board just to keep the cost down ?
33011	0	a	I th
33012	0	a	I think we can by by not having anything too complicated .
33013	0	a	And the rubber push buttons , rubber case .
33014	0	a	Rubber Rubber buttons and case .
33015	0	a	and we do not really know much about the colour scheme or logo yet do we ,
33016	1	a	but possibly a sticker .
33017	0	a	Yeah .
33018	0	a	Yeah .
33019	0	a	Yeah
33020	1	a	and and the voice recognition , we can use that
33021	1	a	ca not we , just to find it .
33022	0	a	Yeah yeah .
33023	1	a	Without affecting the circuit board .
33024	0	a	Yes .
33025	0	a	Yep .
33026	1	a	And see we could always decide against it if something comes up that is just something to that we seemed to leave out .
33027	0	a	Okay .
33028	0	a	And then are we going for sort of one button shaped like a fruit .
33029	0	a	Yeah
33030	0	a	that sounds like it would not do too much harm in a couple of years .
33031	0	a	Or veg .
33032	0	a	what sort of shape do we want ?
33033	0	a	Yeah ,
33034	0	a	so it is not too wacky .
33035	0	a	Do not know ,
33036	0	a	maybe just
33037	0	a	Yeah .
33038	0	a	So we have got spongy feel buttons as well , have we ?
33039	0	a	As well as or w or was that
33040	0	a	So it is rubber buttons , so it is not really spongy feel buttons , it is just rubber buttons .
33041	0	a	That is ru rubber buttons , yeah .
33042	0	a	Yeah ,
33043	0	a	it was just
33044	0	a	Kay .
33045	0	a	Yeah .
33046	0	a	With a rubber case right ?
33047	0	a	And the standby button is going to be different .
33048	0	a	Reasonably spongy I guess , yeah .
33049	0	a	Yeah okay .
33050	0	a	I think an apple would be a good recognisable shape .
33051	0	a	If you start getting into kind of aubergines and things , it gets a bit weird .
33052	0	a	Yeah .
33053	0	a	Okay
33054	0	a	so what what shape are we making the standby button ?
33055	0	a	A apple .
33056	1	a	Apple ?
33057	0	a	Yeah .
33058	1	a	Vote ?
33059	0	a	Shall we vote on it ?
33060	1	a	Anyone got any suggestions ?
33061	0	a	Oh oh Sorry ?
33062	0	a	A red apple ?
33063	0	a	Is it ?
33064	0	a	Sorry
33065	0	a	what was that last thing again there ?
33066	0	a	Right much option on that .
33067	0	a	Yeah .
33068	0	a	We will go for the a a a apples apples .
33069	0	a	Apple apple a a qu
33070	0	a	Quite a big one , as well .
33071	0	a	Okay .
33072	0	a	A big apple .
33073	0	a	Could be a red apple , yeah .
33074	1	a	Well it could be red .
33075	0	a	Either , do not mind .
33076	0	a	Yeah cause we want to incorporate a bit of colour if we can ,
33077	0	a	once we find out
33078	0	a	Yeah .
33079	0	a	Okay .
33080	0	a	And then we are going to
33081	0	a	are you going to work on keeping the button design quite simple ?
33082	0	a	Just like the
33083	0	a	Just working out what we are going to do for the next time .
33084	0	a	Yeah that seems pretty straight forward .
33085	0	a	Yeah .
33086	0	a	Cause most of them will just be kind of mainly circular or like very plain .
33087	0	a	Kay .
33088	0	a	Okay .
33089	0	a	just to keep the shape of the buttons simple .
33090	0	a	I thought you were going for a single curve and
33091	0	a	Alright .
33092	0	a	just the shape of the buttons .
33093	0	a	And j yeah , just keeping the sort of the labelling them labelling of them fairly simple as well .
33094	0	a	Fairly sort of self explanatory .
33095	0	a	Right , so shape of buttons simple .
33096	0	a	Okay .
33097	0	a	So that is that , I guess .
33098	1	a	We should now go away and get these things sorted out .
33099	0	a	I guess you two are on plasticine duty or whatever .
33100	0	a	Okay .
33101	0	a	Okay , so .
33102	0	a	Is that the end ?
33103	0	a	 
33104	0	a	So is
33105	0	a	Why not save that .
33106	0	a	No , you will ha have to open it up from elsewhere .
33107	0	a	Do you want to replace existing file , no .
33108	0	a	I actually tried to transfer it to My Documents , but
33109	0	a	spreadsheet .
33110	1	a	Yeah , you have to you have to close that window .
33111	0	a	Cause that is the save one is not it , so
33112	1	a	And then find it .
33113	0	a	Yeah , but I have ta
33114	1	a	right , I will just re do it .
33115	0	a	That is the easiest way .
33116	0	a	Right .
33117	0	a	Well we have made our prototype anyway .
33118	1	a	We can have a good look at that .
33119	1	a	You pass it round to have a look .
33120	0	a	Y
33121	0	a	no , it is a slightly curved around the sides .
33122	0	a	very nice .
33123	0	a	, it is almost curved like up to the main display as well .
33124	0	a	And the little line at the bottom indicates the bit the panel that you pull down .
33125	0	a	And the extra function buttons are below that panel on the little line .
33126	0	a	And we have got the stick on the button with the company logo on .
33127	0	a	We also have a apple slash cherry design at the top .
33128	0	a	So it is , yeah .
33129	0	a	Cherry would be alright actually .
33130	0	a	Yeah .
33131	0	a	Yeah , it is a bit more fun , is not it ?
33132	0	a	And it is kind of not really at a kind of
33133	0	a	you think apple , you think computers , like Apple Mac .
33134	0	a	Yeah , yeah ,
33135	0	a	we might get a For the M .
33136	0	a	Copyright , yeah .
33137	0	a	What is this this one ?
33138	0	a	What is that one there ?
33139	0	a	Oh , okay .
33140	0	a	Yeah , and cherries are fun , summery .
33141	0	a	, that is the mute .
33142	0	a	Right .
33143	1	a	It it would probably have to be labelled mute .
33144	0	a	Uh huh .
33145	0	a	But , we did not have anything small enough to write .
33146	0	a	They are thinking
33147	0	a	For the first time , well it was hard to get the h the actual labelling on the individual buttons .
33148	0	a	Okay .
33149	0	a	Yeah .
33150	0	a	, we just chose simple shapes for all them .
33151	0	a	, the important ones are the volume ones .
33152	0	a	So we made them a bit bigger .
33153	0	a	The mute could possibly be a bit smaller .
33154	0	a	Hum , you separate off in colour the volume related buttons from the channel related buttons , so you have got the volume in orange on design there , and the the channel is in blue .
33155	0	a	Yeah .
33156	0	a	R right .
33157	0	a	Yeah , and we chose a V plus and V minus .
33158	0	a	all these things have cost implications .
33159	0	a	And so when I done my thing on cost a I had assumed that the only button that would be a different colour would be the the red apple button .
33160	0	a	So However , I have now .
33161	0	a	But , yeah
33162	0	a	so but there would be a cost implication on that , and as I suppose that so whether wanted to put in all these colours , would be open to debate , I suppose .
33163	1	a	I will see if I can find them .
33164	0	a	Yeah , sis
33165	0	a	Yes , we will have the slide away .
33166	0	a	Well the colours would not like that is they would not be too important , but we did not have any white Play Doh .
33167	0	a	Have
33168	0	a	So that is where the colour buttons came from .
33169	0	a	An important consideration .
33170	0	a	Right , okay so
33171	0	a	And the second one underneath would be the idea for the
33172	0	a	Right , okay .
33173	0	a	Bottom .
33174	0	a	So we have got detail design meeting .
33175	0	a	Right .
33176	0	a	So
33177	0	a	So , we have got prototype presentation , which we have just done , evaluation criteria , and finance , so I guess w we have to evaluate if that meets the various aspects that we are looking for from our previous meeting .
33178	0	a	So other than the fact that it does not have the second layer , but obviously obviously it would .
33179	0	a	But other than that , we got the red apple .
33180	0	a	We got the buttons and the only thing that has really changed is
33181	0	a	the is the colouration of the buttons , and the bit after the evaluation criteria is is the finance .
33182	0	a	Yes , yes .
33183	0	a	Right .
33184	0	a	Okay .
33185	0	a	And the and the cost implication .
33186	0	a	The only snag about this is that the cost is probably kind of important .
33187	0	a	So , and then the production evaluation , as to how easy that would be to to manufacture .
33188	0	a	, and whether it would
33189	0	a	Right , so as far as the the finance of it would be concern would be to make sure that the cost aye the production cost cause you may remember that was one of the first considerations was to be in d under twelve fifty or two and a half twelve and a half Euros .
33190	0	a	So if you had to do a presentation or will you just work it on the prototype ?
33191	0	a	That is the pr
33192	0	a	Okay .
33193	0	a	, that is it .
33194	0	a	This this is a
33195	0	a	yes ,
33196	0	a	this is our presentation of the prototype .
33197	0	a	So , there is no redesign .
33198	0	a	So that should
33199	1	a	Right , so , seems to me that the thing that I have to do is is quickly find that
33200	0	a	Right .
33201	1	a	Could we get this on the board just so we can see
33202	0	a	or do you mean do you have the figures there ?
33203	0	a	Kay , Alice .
33204	0	a	we should plug it in .
33205	1	a	Do you want to plu do you want to plug it in into the the back of that one .
33206	0	a	Okay .
33207	0	a	So , sh
33208	0	a	Kay this should be then .
33209	1	a	We could do it as we d go along , the production costs , looking at the prototype .
33210	0	a	Right .
33211	0	a	Okay , so , by the fact that we have got the simple chip and the kinetic energy source , we have got a single curved case .
33212	0	a	We have got a rubber case materials supplements .
33213	0	a	So , we had decided that we are having rubber buttons and
33214	0	a	Okay .
33215	0	a	Have a push button interface .
33216	0	a	W the button supplements .
33217	0	a	Yeah .
33218	0	a	Well , originally , I thought there would just be one in there because it was the one red apple .
33219	0	a	But
33220	0	a	So the so the real w the real question then would come in .
33221	0	a	Do you make all the buttons
33222	0	a	O
33223	0	a	Well , so we have got one special button form , which was the apple .
33224	0	a	Well do we will do it on the prototype ,
33225	1	a	so do two , see how much it is .
33226	0	a	Everything else is going to be a standard .
33227	0	a	Yeah .
33228	0	a	And then we would have
33229	0	a	So that is nine point one there
33230	0	a	so we have got some
33231	0	a	Kay .
33232	0	a	We have got special material , rubber , wood , titanium , et cetera and that , so , I was originally , I was thinking rubber was not special , but according to this , maybe it is .
33233	0	a	So
33234	0	a	And the r I mean effectively we have got sixteen buttons that we are going to have on there .
33235	0	a	Yeah .
33236	0	a	I think you just do one , do not you ,
33237	0	a	for the I think I think it is just it is just a one .
33238	0	a	W I do not know is is is the sort of answer , is that meant to be all sixteen buttons ,
33239	0	a	and therefore I mean , what is the op
33240	1	a	The option was maybe not to have rubber buttons , but just to have the one that was soft and spongy ,
33241	0	a	and therefore
33242	0	a	Whereas it would be the special colour would be for the
33243	0	a	So you would only have the one special button that was rubber , whereas the rest would be hard plastic .
33244	0	a	Else I thi
33245	0	a	I think I think the button supplement i is just a supplement for all the buttons made in a different material , rather than per button .
33246	0	a	I do not know though .
33247	0	a	I would Every design change is
33248	0	a	I dunno ,
33249	0	a	Okay , ,
33250	0	a	if we just had all the buttons as standard , except for the one red apple , then that would take care of that , I guess .
33251	0	a	We would have one special colour and one special button form .
33252	0	a	And when I plugged that in last time remember it has to be under twelve and a half .
33253	0	a	As far as I know , that that took care of the of the various supplements .
33254	0	a	And if
33255	0	a	What happened ?
33256	0	a	Now , right .
33257	0	a	You have just gone off the window into another one .
33258	0	a	It is on the bottom row .
33259	1	a	Maybe if you just minimise that one in the top right hand corner of the little box .
33260	0	a	Yeah .
33261	0	a	Okay , so , but the point would be that if we if we just did special
33262	0	a	Sorry ,
33263	0	a	you were saying that it would be that one , that you would put in one there .
33264	0	a	Yeah .
33265	0	a	Yeah .
33266	0	a	Okay .
33267	0	a	So it Well , is it s is
33268	0	a	no ,
33269	0	a	it is nine point seven I have got .
33270	0	a	Okay .
33271	0	a	Just give us a bit of I switching around those th on the electronics we got the sample sensor .
33272	0	a	So , that would that would work out fine if as assuming your correction are are assuming that that one change covers all the buttons , then that would be fine .
33273	0	a	And there is nothing else as far as I can see that we we had planned to put on .
33274	0	a	S , .
33275	0	a	At the moment we have just got the simple chip , which costs one .
33276	0	a	, I guess the sample sens sample speaker would be the voice recognition thing , which puts up to four ?
33277	0	a	We should be slightly over our budget
33278	1	a	but if we gather something else down to slightly lower standard , and maybe go with the one the special form buttons , then we could have the speech
33279	1	a	So maybe if we got rid of like the maybe one of the special colours , kept them all the same colour , then we could have the voice recognition
33280	0	a	without
33281	0	a	Yeah ,
33282	0	a	yeah .
33283	0	a	Uh huh .
33284	0	a	Yeah .
33285	0	a	Yeah .
33286	1	a	Well , hold on .
33287	0	a	, if we
33288	0	a	Okay , that gives us twelve point seven But remember that the idea was to keep it the colour of the
33289	0	a	Oh , I see ,
33290	0	a	so just take out the special colour for the apple and
33291	1	a	And go for battery instead .
33292	0	a	D
33293	1	a	would not you have to keep the simple chip there as well ?
33294	0	a	You know how you turn that one to a zero ,
33295	1	a	would not the chip and the sample speaker be separate things , so you need both of them ?
33296	0	a	I think the voice recognition .
33297	0	a	Oh possibly , yeah ,
33298	0	a	yeah maybe .
33299	0	a	Yeah ,
33300	0	a	we have to have it
33301	0	a	Yeah .
33302	1	a	Maybe we would be giving up on the kinetic .
33303	0	a	We should
33304	0	a	Yeah ,
33305	0	a	that would save us one , though we would still be slightly ov
33306	0	a	Yeah ,
33307	0	a	yeah .
33308	0	a	Yeah .
33309	0	a	That would give you one less .
33310	0	a	But you reckon that
33311	0	a	i I mean the thing is that you wanted to a appeal to people and not have to replace batteries .
33312	0	a	Well , since it is the through the whole technology type thing , , you were saying in the market research that people like kind of interesting gadgets in them .
33313	0	a	, whether they would figure
33314	0	a	the the s sample senor and the sample speaker , voice recognition be sort of a worthwhile thing to have .
33315	0	a	And then still have the batteries , or whatever they would prefer not
33316	0	a	You know what I mean ?
33317	0	a	The the problem was the battery is running out and losing the losing the remote .
33318	0	a	Yeah .
33319	0	a	So you gotta decide which of those is more important to them .
33320	0	a	But which do you think or which do we think is the more important of the options ?
33321	0	a	In a sense , at the moment , we have got a total which we need to reduce down by one point two .
33322	0	a	At least .
33323	0	a	Remember that was a minimum requirement .
33324	0	a	The other option if we are planning on just going for something cheap and cheerful , would be to make it originally , we are going to make it a simple product .
33325	1	a	Shall we shall we evaluate the prototype as we have got it now first , and then sort of make decisions about what needs to be changed after ?
33326	0	a	Okay .
33327	0	a	Yeah .
33328	0	a	Makes sense .
33329	0	a	Right ,
33330	0	a	I have a little thing .
33331	0	a	So , we have all got a note of it
33332	0	a	is thirteen point seven , is not it , with everything we want on .
33333	0	a	Sorry ,
33334	0	a	do you want that back up ?
33335	0	a	Right .
33336	0	a	Yeah , I just had a presentation to do .
33337	0	a	But I do think the v voice recognition thing would be more impressive than the fact that it is got no battery .
33338	0	a	Okay ,
33339	0	a	but remember the main the only reason we were planning on having the voice recognition was so that they could find the remote if it got lost .
33340	0	a	Right okay ,
33341	0	a	This is about the evaluation criteria that we use for the the prototype we have got here .
33342	0	a	And so the method is that the design team makes a prototype , and we evaluate the prototype against some criteria that we have formulated .
33343	0	a	And those ones are going to be in response to sort of market research , and also finance , I guess .
33344	0	a	And do that on a scale from say true being one and false being seven , so if it is neither true nor false , then that is four .
33345	0	a	So , I got a set of criteria just based on the marketing that we need to add in a financial one as well , at the end .
33346	0	a	so , We have to say whether it is true or false that the product looks and feels fancy .
33347	0	a	The whether the product demonstrates technical innovation .
33348	0	a	Whether it is easy to use .
33349	0	a	Whether it is incorporating sort of the fashion element to attract the buyer .
33350	0	a	And whether it is a sort of recognisable Real Reaction product .
33351	0	a	And I have to go up onto the whiteboard and do this apparently ,
33352	1	a	so I will go over here .
33353	0	a	Okay Okay .
33354	0	a	Right .
33355	0	a	So the first one is , does the product look and feel fancy .
33356	1	a	So if we do a sort of a one
33357	0	a	So
33358	0	a	Yeah .
33359	0	a	Okay , well we have a single curve ,
33360	0	a	which was maybe like the feel of the product is quite good .
33361	0	a	So
33362	0	a	, then we have the rubber kind of spongy feel , which was in at the time .
33363	0	a	Okay .
33364	0	a	Yeah .
33365	0	a	Yeah .
33366	0	a	, sorry that would be considered fancy .
33367	0	a	Yeah .
33368	0	a	Yeah , I would maybe give it a a two .
33369	0	a	Of
33370	0	a	but I think
33371	0	a	What Is one false , or is t one true ?
33372	0	a	I forgot .
33373	0	a	One is true .
33374	0	a	One is true , and okay .
33375	0	a	Seven is fal Four is neutral , okay .
33376	0	a	And a four is neutral .
33377	0	a	So
33378	0	a	Right .
33379	0	a	So maybe maybe a two .
33380	0	a	Yeah ,
33381	0	a	cause we have not got the double curve , so we ca not like say it is completely true .
33382	0	a	Go for one .
33383	0	a	But it is pretty close .
33384	0	a	Yep .
33385	0	a	We have got almost everything we can .
33386	0	a	Okay .
33387	0	a	Okay .
33388	0	a	Right .
33389	1	a	I going to put underneath so I have got some more space .
33390	0	a	So , false is seven , true is one , and
33391	1	a	So say about a two for fancy ,
33392	0	a	you think ?
33393	0	a	Okay .
33394	0	a	Yeah .
33395	0	a	Yeah .
33396	0	a	Yeah , why not not ,
33397	1	a	m m maybe nearer three .
33398	0	a	Okay , well d you do an average at the end , I do not know .
33399	0	a	Two three .
33400	0	a	Uh huh .
33401	0	a	Well , it is just that saying something remember that when you look down , we have got solar power , we have got various other things you could have , and we are not going for these options .
33402	0	a	This this is just this is just for like the look .
33403	0	a	Does it sort of look fancy rather than functional .
33404	0	a	So
33405	0	a	Yeah ,
33406	0	a	so that
33407	0	a	so sh should we go for a a two on that ?
33408	0	a	Kay .
33409	0	a	Yeah , I suppose that might be in the technical innovation bit .
33410	0	a	Okay .
33411	0	a	And I mean , how much does the product demonstrate technical innovation do you reckon ?
33412	0	a	D
33413	0	a	yeah .
33414	0	a	, deciding between the kinetic power or the speech recognition , and if we had either of those for our budget , they both show a reasonable amount of speech recognition .
33415	0	a	Okay .
33416	0	a	So , what about the pr
33417	0	a	The prototype as it is ,
33418	0	a	we have got we have got the speech recognition on it , have not we .
33419	0	a	But not the kinetic .
33420	0	a	But not the kinetic .
33421	0	a	Like the power .
33422	0	a	No .
33423	0	a	Cause you ca not afford that w
33424	0	a	we took that out too .
33425	0	a	No ,
33426	0	a	we c ca
33427	0	a	yeah ,
33428	0	a	we ca not afford both .
33429	0	a	Alright , so
33430	0	a	So it does not It is pretty
33431	0	a	The prototype as it is is not sort of fulfilling the
33432	0	a	Okay .
33433	0	a	Did not you ?
33434	0	a	Or
33435	0	a	Well , wait a minute .
33436	0	a	No
33437	1	a	may is maybe about neutral
33438	0	a	plus it it it is got something , but it has not got
33439	0	a	Right .
33440	0	a	Maybe a three .
33441	0	a	Yeah .
33442	0	a	In thirteen point seven we do have kinetic .
33443	0	a	I would give it more than a four .
33444	0	a	The problem is we have to reduce down from there to get it down to twelve point five .
33445	0	a	Okay .
33446	0	a	And one way of doing that would be to take out the kinetic .
33447	0	a	So , it is very much dependant on what you do with your options .
33448	0	a	Right , okay .
33449	0	a	And if you are definitely going for the sample sensor and sample speaker , then because that the other functions we have got in are are more at the
33450	0	a	The special material , the rubber , wood , titanium , et cetera , if you go for that , th that is at the high end cause that is point six , whereas down at just special colours is point two .
33451	0	a	Kay .
33452	0	a	Now you are trying to lose one point two , so it seems to me that if you are going for the sample sensors speaker , you are basically then having to go for the cheaper options on everything else .
33453	0	a	Okay .
33454	0	a	And and the simple way to do it would be to have a battery , to have your sample sensor speaker , and then you are looking to take out point two , which would be come from the button supplements category .
33455	0	a	S
33456	1	a	I am just going to check my email .
33457	1	a	I am just going to check exactly what it said in the email for the product .
33458	0	a	How much of a difference would it make if we made the case in plastic ?
33459	0	a	Because we did say that we do not want to follow the fashion too much .
33460	0	a	If the buttons are rubber that might be spongy enough .
33461	0	a	And then it stand the test of time better .
33462	0	a	, interface type ,
33463	0	a	well plastic rather than rubber .
33464	0	a	Okay .
33465	0	a	But I
33466	0	a	Okay .
33467	0	a	That that that would make the significant difference .
33468	0	a	You could either you could have it
33469	0	a	If you have a in plastic rather than rubber , then that would enable you to get you could keep kinetic then , you could keep your sample sensor , and you would be looking to take out point two .
33470	1	a	So you could fiddle that down your special form at the bottom , or your special colour at the bottom .
33471	0	a	And that would enable you to to do it .
33472	0	a	So it says if we make a slightly more fancy , then we lose points innovation , and if we make it more innovative innovative , then we lose points on it being fancy , so
33473	0	a	Yeah ,
33474	0	a	yeah .
33475	0	a	Yeah .
33476	0	a	Yeah .
33477	0	a	Well , okay , but
33478	0	a	It is rubber as it is , yes .
33479	0	a	, I just read the email again and it sort of says it is evaluate the design sort of as it is , I think ,
33480	0	a	so I think we need to think about finance after we have sort of evaluated that design .
33481	0	a	I do not know whether we are doing it in the wrong order or something or .
33482	0	a	Well , I suppose it is rubber as it is , is not it .
33483	0	a	So , I mean does this need to go up a bit or something ,
33484	0	a	cause we have got both the both the the speech
33485	0	a	Yeah .
33486	0	a	We got we have we have got thirteen point seven
33487	0	a	and we have got it in at the moment
33488	0	a	and if and basically , we are going to reduce down from that .
33489	0	a	Yeah .
33490	0	a	But the current one , you would say would be fancy , would be too
33491	0	a	Yeah .
33492	0	a	, for for innovation , so we have got the speech the speech thing , and
33493	0	a	Do you reckon a two ?
33494	0	a	Okay .
33495	0	a	I would have said about a two as well .
33496	0	a	Yeah ,
33497	0	a	two or three .
33498	0	a	I would be happy with a two .
33499	0	a	Oh .
33500	0	a	Two .
33501	0	a	And the next one is
33502	1	a	I will have to get it back up now .
33503	0	a	The next on
33504	1	a	Well , I can just sing about .
33505	0	a	Easy to use .
33506	0	a	I would have said yes .
33507	0	a	I would go for a one on that at this point in time .
33508	0	a	Yeah .
33509	0	a	Okay .
33510	0	a	Yeah ,
33511	0	a	I would say so as well .
33512	0	a	, incorporates elements of fashion to attract buyer .
33513	0	a	Well , yeah it certainly has some .
33514	0	a	It does , yeah .
33515	0	a	Yeah ,
33516	0	a	it is got the cherry and the sponginess .
33517	1	a	Say about a three maybe ?
33518	0	a	It is a two .
33519	0	a	Yep .
33520	0	a	I do not know .
33521	0	a	Yeah , m
33522	0	a	Yeah ,
33523	0	a	it was just doing it quite well .
33524	1	a	Maybe two ?
33525	0	a	Yeah , that is a bit rough at the minute .
33526	0	a	, I think we are going to have to lose some of these , but the moment , as it stands , it is the sensor using all of its all of its products , all of its buttons , and it is got a fairly big label on the bottom saying where it comes from .
33527	0	a	Yep .
33528	0	a	Yeah , I woulda said two would seem reasonable .
33529	0	a	The product is a recognisable real r reaction product ?
33530	0	a	Oh .
33531	0	a	Yeah , this is This
33532	0	a	Yeah .
33533	0	a	So this is about sort of the corporate image of like new sort of sleek technology and all that sort of thing , as well as having the logo on and all that .
33534	0	a	Okay .
33535	0	a	So sort of Is it sort of a recognisable product .
33536	0	a	Does it fit in with our other other products , which are sort of coffee makers and spacecraft .
33537	0	a	, well it is got the same speech feature as the coffee machine .
33538	0	a	What do y
33539	0	a	Yeah .
33540	0	a	S
33541	0	a	Okay .
33542	0	a	Also it is kind of spongy rubberiness is maybe bit more kind of comfortable than kind of sleek and new age .
33543	0	a	, it depends which way you look at it .
33544	0	a	Uh huh .
33545	0	a	So we are going for a two , three ?
33546	0	a	Sure .
33547	0	a	So
33548	1	a	Two or three ?
33549	0	a	Yeah .
33550	1	a	Maybe a kind of three ?
33551	0	a	d Yeah , so it is So should we get So are definite
33552	0	a	Was it thirteen point seven was the definite price rule if has .
33553	0	a	Yeah , two or three .
33554	0	a	Well , the logo would be more recognisable on the actual thing .
33555	0	a	It is just that the pen would not really write on that paper .
33556	0	a	But , I think the logo would definitely be recognisable .
33557	0	a	And it does have attributes that other products do .
33558	0	a	Two ?
33559	0	a	Aye .
33560	1	a	Go for it .
33561	0	a	Right , okay .
33562	0	a	Two or three .
33563	0	a	Two .
33564	0	a	How
33565	0	a	Two .
33566	0	a	Right , come on .
33567	0	a	That is that decided .
33568	0	a	Okay .
33569	0	a	Right .
33570	0	a	So
33571	0	a	So we are now on to changing it to get it to fit in with the budget requirements ,
33572	0	a	and then
33573	0	a	About a two .
33574	0	a	Right .
33575	0	a	Yeah .
33576	0	a	What does what do all
33577	0	a	them numbers mean then ?
33578	0	a	Do we add them up and rate or anything ?
33579	1	a	we will probably have to re rate it .
33580	0	a	Yeah we s
33581	0	a	yeah ,
33582	0	a	I think we sort of add them up so sort of at an average is going to be
33583	1	a	I am just going to do this in my head .
33584	0	a	Two .
33585	0	a	One point eight is not it or something .
33586	0	a	I think , anyway .
33587	0	a	So yeah , pretty close to a two .
33588	0	a	So
33589	0	a	So it is I mean it is pretty good at the moment ,
33590	0	a	but it is going to get worse , is not it .
33591	0	a	But we have gotta try and make sure it does not get too bad .
33592	0	a	Yep .
33593	0	a	Two b two b two , yeah .
33594	0	a	Yes .
33595	0	a	Yeah .
33596	0	a	Okay , so we need to
33597	0	a	So I guess this Is this the last stage once we sort out the finances part of it ?
33598	0	a	Yeah , yeah
33599	0	a	we will make the adjustments and then see how are rates are going .
33600	0	a	Well , you can lose one point two and still meet the requirements .
33601	1	a	Do you want to plug it into yours so we can get up the the finances
33602	0	a	I am not sure .
33603	0	a	Okay , well I put it back on .
33604	0	a	Yes , I would have thought so .
33605	0	a	Yeah .
33606	0	a	Okay , so what was it , control F eight , was not it ?
33607	0	a	Oh .
33608	0	a	it is on .
33609	0	a	it is come on already .
33610	0	a	Oh .
33611	0	a	How kind .
33612	0	a	Right , okay .
33613	0	a	So ,
33614	0	a	you can see there that the
33615	0	a	If you want to keep kinetic , right , you have got a choice there of going down to battery , which would save you one .
33616	0	a	You have got the sample sensor and and sample speaker , which is your big item .
33617	0	a	Oh actually we just have a plastic case , then we lose two points , which gets us
33618	0	a	In right within the budget range .
33619	0	a	That is right .
33620	0	a	Which gets you
33621	0	a	Yes .
33622	0	a	Yeah , I think that would be fine .
33623	0	a	Because that was just a trend , and we do have rubber buttons anyway .
33624	0	a	So that is eleven point seven , and then we could make sure we definitely had all the button supplements .
33625	0	a	Yeah .
33626	0	a	Different different colours , yeah .
33627	0	a	Alright .
33628	0	a	Yeah , I was
33629	0	a	I was thinking
33630	0	a	that because maybe maybe the sort of rubber case is a bit less in sort of the corporate identity than the sort of you know sleeker plastic case .
33631	0	a	Possibly , yeah .
33632	0	a	And that would allow us to have all the technical innovations .
33633	0	a	Yeah .
33634	0	a	Okay , so
33635	0	a	So we are going for plastic , yes ?
33636	0	a	Yep .
33637	0	a	So we would lose a little bit on the maybe kind of
33638	0	a	Oh yeah , and that would now be
33639	0	a	Yeah , that is that is within the budget .
33640	0	a	Lose a little bit on the fashion , yeah , but
33641	0	a	And then
33642	0	a	Yeah .
33643	0	a	Do we actually have
33644	0	a	Do we just have one special special forms down here ?
33645	0	a	And we we have we have got we have got enough for another
33646	0	a	we have got nought point eight
33647	0	a	left
33648	0	a	, so we have got enough for another
33649	0	a	Yeah ,
33650	0	a	But the but
33651	0	a	but but the
33652	0	a	I think maybe the special colour , we have got three now just because the volume buttons are different , I guess we would have the ones which are blue at the moment would would just be the standard colour .
33653	0	a	Well , w there was debate as to how you would count them .
33654	0	a	You got special colour .
33655	0	a	Well originally I was assuming we had the red apple , and therefore , that was the special colour .
33656	1	a	Yeah , I think we should just imagine white buttons .
33657	0	a	Well , we have got special form .
33658	0	a	Now that would be one button , and the question was was that all buttons or is that just one button .
33659	0	a	Cause our plan really was to have one button only with a special
33660	0	a	So so no matter how you look at that , that would be the same .
33661	0	a	The other thing would then be special material , rubber , wood , titanium .
33662	0	a	Yeah .
33663	0	a	Alright .
33664	0	a	So , special colour , you want three in there .
33665	0	a	Yeah ,
33666	0	a	which I think we should
33667	0	a	Yeah ,
33668	0	a	they will still be fine for the for the price .
33669	0	a	Okay .
33670	0	a	Well I thin
33671	0	a	I think you
33672	0	a	you
33673	0	a	you just need two for the special colour cause it is just two supplements , you know .
33674	0	a	One original colour and then sort of two supplements , I think maybe .
33675	0	a	That makes sense .
33676	0	a	Okay , that is probably it .
33677	0	a	Okay .
33678	0	a	Yeah .
33679	0	a	So we only ne we only need two for that .
33680	0	a	Okay .
33681	0	a	Cause I mean these these are moulded .
33682	0	a	The one colour is going to be moulded out of a piece of plas of rubber , is not it .
33683	0	a	Okay .
33684	0	a	Yeah , I would agree with that , I think .
33685	0	a	Right .
33686	0	a	And we have got special form is the one apple .
33687	0	a	The rest are all standard ,
33688	0	a	although you could argue that should maybe be
33689	0	a	You were making these buttons down the bottom , I was presuming , bigger than the other ones ,
33690	0	a	or were you ?
33691	0	a	Was that the idea ?
33692	0	a	Uh huh .
33693	0	a	Ne
33694	0	a	Maybe that will be a second supplement .
33695	0	a	Yeah ,
33696	0	a	the volume ones should stand out a bit .
33697	0	a	Then there is a spe a second special form .
33698	0	a	I would have thought that is probably about r well .
33699	0	a	Well you got you got twelve .
33700	0	a	Yeah , that Okay , so tha
33701	0	a	So shall we do a
33702	0	a	Well ,
33703	0	a	Yeah .
33704	0	a	So I think that should still be okay .
33705	0	a	Yeah , that is twelve point three , so we are still within budget on that .
33706	0	a	Right .
33707	0	a	Yep , that makes sense .
33708	0	a	So decide we have lost a little bit on the fashion and lost a bit on the fancy kind of side of it , but generally speaking , we have kept the other attributes to the
33709	0	a	That is without
33710	0	a	Yeah .
33711	0	a	Yep .
33712	0	a	I woulda said so .
33713	1	a	Yeah .
33714	1	a	So you would maybe put fash fan fashion at three rather than two .
33715	0	a	And specially it definitely could fits the the real product
33716	0	a	What was the what is the company name ?
33717	0	a	R
33718	0	a	yeah .
33719	0	a	Real Reactions ?
33720	0	a	Yeah ,
33721	0	a	I do not see how we could make it any more .
33722	0	a	Real Reaction produ
33723	0	a	I am not quite sure , what does that mean ?
33724	0	a	Yep
33725	0	a	I would s You mean of
33726	1	a	Well you could argue you might do it once a year , you would change ,
33727	0	a	because at the moment you are making a red apple .
33728	0	a	Yeah ,
33729	0	a	yeah .
33730	0	a	I mean it still seems definitely fit that
33731	0	a	p
33732	0	a	so that is like if that is the new age kind of inno innovative c type company , then having the kinetic feature and the voice recognition is p quite high up on
33733	0	a	Yeah , so
33734	1	a	So it is w if we have if we have put in for another special form on a button , then maybe they could be a different shape .
33735	0	a	Like we got a cherry one .
33736	0	a	Maybe other ones could be something else shaped .
33737	0	a	I do not know .
33738	0	a	That would be poss seeing as seeing as it is cheaper to make them a different seeing as we have got , you know , we have made it a a special form , so And that would sort of maybe keep us close on the sort of the fashion type one .
33739	0	a	And it would sort of , you know , keep it quite fancy as well ,
33740	0	a	I do not know .
33741	0	a	Yeah so it is a
33742	1	a	Whatever fruit was in fashion next year .
33743	0	a	Well you could
33744	0	a	Yeah .
33745	1	a	So next year you could make next year is model the same , but have it as a a yeah whate
33746	1	a	whatever , a lemon .
33747	1	a	Yeah , l a lemon lemon or something .
33748	1	a	Yeah , I mean the volume buttons could be lemons or something , maybe .
33749	0	a	And that amount
33750	0	a	Yeah ,
33751	0	a	we have the main thing we have changed really is the casing is not it ?
33752	0	a	Well , ease has certainly stayed .
33753	0	a	Okay .
33754	0	a	So , we have what have we what have we rid of .
33755	0	a	We got rid of the plastic .
33756	0	a	Is it
33757	0	a	The rubber .
33758	0	a	That
33759	0	a	yeah ,
33760	0	a	that was
33761	0	a	that was just about all .
33762	0	a	Yeah .
33763	0	a	I think we have saved quite a bit because we have just got the push button interface , which is by far the cheapest .
33764	0	a	Yeah .
33765	1	a	So maybe in a sense not having that , maybe we have lost some maybe lost something on the innovation side ?
33766	0	a	I dunno .
33767	0	a	But
33768	0	a	So I mean , we have got we got rid of the rubber case , but we have now s
33769	0	a	we now sort of got an extra form , and an extra colour for the buttons .
33770	0	a	And that is like the most standard type of button .
33771	1	a	So maybe in terms of sort of fanciness and fashionability , we are pretty much the same , maybe .
33772	0	a	Yeah .
33773	0	a	So , I mean we could maybe put two again on them .
33774	0	a	And everything else has stayed pretty much the same , so
33775	0	a	Yeah ,
33776	0	a	plus if anything that is special forms makes it slightly easier to to use .
33777	0	a	Yeah .
33778	0	a	Yeah .
33779	0	a	Yeah .
33780	0	a	And what about the sort of innovation ?
33781	0	a	Do you think
33782	0	a	Okay .
33783	0	a	, well we have still got the kinetic energy .
33784	0	a	Yeah , the speech feature .
33785	0	a	And the speech feature .
33786	0	a	And then , the corporate identity .
33787	0	a	I think we have cut just about the same .
33788	0	a	We have maybe lost
33789	0	a	Has not it
33790	0	a	It is hard to tell how the rubber the rubber casing would really affect
33791	0	a	But I think more the the features of the actual control will be more important than maybe than the the actual aesthetics , but
33792	0	a	But either way , I think we have made it fairly close to what just the the company logo .
33793	0	a	How it would play out , yeah .
33794	0	a	Yeah .
33795	0	a	Oh .
33796	0	a	Whether whether that is considered to be sort of part of the corporate identity , I do not know .
33797	0	a	I mean , it is maybe not .
33798	0	a	I mean
33799	0	a	Yeah .
33800	0	a	Yeah .
33801	0	a	Yeah .
33802	0	a	Okay , well I mean We cou .
33803	1	a	, apart from maybe doing the whole thing in the kind of light shade of blue , like the casing .
33804	1	a	But then what colour would you make the Rs ?
33805	0	a	No ,
33806	0	a	I just
33807	0	a	We got the logo off the web browser .
33808	0	a	So maybe there is like a set design which we get printed off .
33809	0	a	Well , but you have got the company logo on there , which would effectively be a stick on badge .
33810	0	a	Yeah .
33811	0	a	Okay .
33812	0	a	So you are in a sense , you are comparing the product without the company logo .
33813	0	a	Yeah .
33814	0	a	And then y but you have got the space for it to stick it on .
33815	0	a	Yeah ,
33816	0	a	yeah .
33817	0	a	Hey , what what what is the company colour ?
33818	0	a	Did you get told what the company colour is or
33819	0	a	Oh right .
33820	0	a	I am still not quite sure we have established that .
33821	0	a	Do not think so .
33822	0	a	But but i but in the sense that , as you saw with the Windows logo badge , it does not really matter .
33823	0	a	There is virtually n
33824	0	a	The way that you frame , you know , the Windows badge on there , it really does not matter what colour it is , so long as our company is logo is framed w in the same way as that with a like a black outline .
33825	0	a	Fact , they have got black and white or black and silver .
33826	0	a	So basically , even if you had a silver the same colour of silver on your display , because you have got effectively a double edging on the on the logo , it means that it splits off what your logo is from the from the product .
33827	0	a	And that is actually quite a sneaky way of doing it .
33828	0	a	Okay .
33829	0	a	Uh huh .
33830	0	a	Cause you have got sort of
33831	0	a	we have got point two to play with if you really wanted to .
33832	1	a	You could put in another
33833	0	a	Well , in this one , you have actually got three colours of buttons .
33834	1	a	Another colour .
33835	0	a	Or would that be t
33836	0	a	Yeah .
33837	0	a	Well , we decided that the blue ones were the the standard colour .
33838	0	a	Okay .
33839	0	a	So you were talking about
33840	0	a	We are assuming that all the buttons on the second panel , the hidden away panel , would all be standard .
33841	0	a	Yeah .
33842	0	a	Yeah .
33843	0	a	Which m may or may not be the case .
33844	0	a	Yeah .
33845	1	a	Shall we save the point two for profitability then ?
33846	0	a	Yeah ,
33847	0	a	maybe we have m
33848	1	a	Maybe for the the one they are going to see all the time , we make it look good , and , fit the kind of idea of what they want .
33849	0	a	Well , yeah .
33850	0	a	Bu but but was the was there not a button that you were thinking of on the on the other opt you know , on the second page , as it were , that you were thinking of maybe having as a different colour ?
33851	0	a	Yeah ,
33852	0	a	well
33853	0	a	Alright .
33854	0	a	, I do not think they would really need to be .
33855	0	a	I think if they were just all small round blue buttons , it would be fine .
33856	0	a	Needs to be an enter button , but could just be the same as well .
33857	1	a	And then for the more functional buttons , we do not worry too much about that and just have that as like a
33858	0	a	plus it is hidden away anyway , you are not going to see it at the start .
33859	0	a	Yeah .
33860	0	a	I mean it is the sort of thing that , I mean , you want to pick up the controller and just hit a button quickly to change the channel or volume .
33861	0	a	So , if it is dead obvious , then that is fine .
33862	0	a	But if you are opening the panel and you are looking and you are tuning , then you are paying a bit more attention .
33863	0	a	So it may be sort of different colour buttons is not so important .
33864	0	a	Okay .
33865	0	a	Cause you
33866	0	a	Yeah .
33867	0	a	Yeah .
33868	0	a	So we just add that to profitability in effect .
33869	0	a	So
33870	0	a	Yeah ,
33871	0	a	I mean so we have dropped the cost , but
33872	0	a	Same sort of function ?
33873	0	a	The criteria ?
33874	0	a	It is alright .
33875	0	a	Right , so we are meant to finish up in five minutes .
33876	0	a	Kay .
33877	0	a	Just made a load of money .
33878	1	a	Should not we maybe lose a point on fashion , go to a three ?
33879	0	a	Cause we have lost the overall spongy feel .
33880	0	a	Cause it does not seem right that it just has not changed at all .
33881	0	a	Well , but I think we said that w Because you got rid of the rubber , we put an extra an extra sort of fruit shape on one of the buttons .
33882	0	a	Alright .
33883	0	a	le lemon sh I think
33884	1	a	well , we could have lemon shaped ones with the volume ones or something .
33885	0	a	Did we decide what that was , which button it was ?
33886	0	a	On the volume ones ?
33887	0	a	Right .
33888	1	a	Or something like that .
33889	0	a	That is good .
33890	1	a	Yeah .
33891	0	a	Definitely lemon shaped .
33892	0	a	Did did you have to have a rubber case , though , for rubber buttons ?
33893	0	a	Or was it the other way around ?
33894	0	a	Right , okay .
33895	0	a	You had to have rubber buttons if you had the rubber case .
33896	0	a	So I think we can we are okay .
33897	0	a	So we are okay this way around .
33898	0	a	Yeah .
33899	0	a	So that so we have saved
33900	0	a	Saved two Euros on that .
33901	0	a	Until the design team comes in and says , get off .
33902	0	a	But you are the design team .
33903	0	a	Then we say it is fine , so it is all good .
33904	0	a	So what bit are we on to ?
33905	0	a	Yeah .
33906	0	a	I th
33907	0	a	I th
33908	0	a	Oh .
33909	0	a	Right , okay .
33910	0	a	Just in case we need that point two for lawsuits and such like .
33911	0	a	Oh drats ,
33912	0	a	I have botched that , have not I .
33913	0	a	, can I just check if that is a cherry or an apple ?
33914	0	a	Did we decide against the apple because of Apple Mac ?
33915	0	a	And did we make it a cherry officially ?
33916	0	a	So were we aiming for a certain target on that scale ?
33917	0	a	Right .
33918	0	a	Well , we are aiming for one for all of them .
33919	0	a	M but it really has to fit into the budget , so
33920	0	a	I guess we just have to adjust things to get it i in the
33921	0	a	Which is fair enough .
33922	0	a	And we seem to have least something in each criteria .
33923	0	a	Yeah .
33924	0	a	We have not completely left anything out , so As an overall product which has to be quite cheap , we have just about achieved everything .
33925	0	a	Yeah ,
33926	0	a	I think most
33927	0	a	Yeah .
33928	0	a	Yep .
33929	0	a	So do we have anything else to discuss ?
33930	0	a	Huh .
33931	0	a	I do not know .
33932	0	a	What is on the agenda ?
33933	0	a	Uh huh .
33934	0	a	Right , okay
33935	0	a	What is happened here ?
33936	0	a	Right , okay
33937	0	a	Right , okay ,
33938	0	a	Right .
33939	0	a	So we got
33940	0	a	So we have done the the finance bit and the Excel project and the We have done the redesign .
33941	0	a	We have got the closing .
33942	0	a	So we are now on to project process .
33943	0	a	Now satisfaction with , for example , room for creativity , leadership , teamwork , means , et cetera , whiteboard , digital pens , et cetera .
33944	0	a	So , we are actually now , in a sense , on to the evaluation of the course rather than the evaluation of the project is m my understanding of it .
33945	0	a	So what did you
33946	0	a	and remembering that nobody is just over the curtain .
33947	0	a	So , So
33948	0	a	I suppose the easiest way of doing it is to put some notes down ,
33949	1	a	which I will do .
33950	0	a	Finish your meeting now .
33951	1	a	We should just go through this quickly and then
33952	0	a	, yeah .
33953	0	a	Yeah .
33954	0	a	Okay .
33955	1	a	So , I think I have to finish that page .
33956	0	a	Oh .
33957	0	a	Right , okay , so
33958	0	a	Project evaluation .
33959	0	a	So ,
33960	0	a	Creativity .
33961	0	a	Did you feel you got a chance to express yourselves well enough ?
33962	0	a	Well
33963	0	a	Individual meetings .
33964	0	a	Yeah .
33965	0	a	Yeah .
33966	0	a	I thought some of the divisions though between sort of the individual meetings were a bit arbitrary .
33967	0	a	How do you mean ?
33968	1	a	In you on your own .
33969	0	a	Yeah .
33970	0	a	Well , we were finding out various things in in be in between the meetings , and they did not the one meeting did not always follow on for the other one , you know ,
33971	0	a	sort of we had things thrown in at the second meeting where , you know , you would looked at the remote controls and seen the curviness , but in the first one you would also looked at some remote controls and looked at the buttons ,
33972	0	a	and I do not understand why it would be in separate meetings that you would do that .
33973	0	a	The only thing you find is in a manufacturing process , you would normally , you go to a meeting , you decide , right
33974	0	a	, you do this
33975	0	a	, you do that , you do that .
33976	1	a	You know , you would sort of you would probably present it at one or something like that .
33977	0	a	Yeah .
33978	0	a	Then you go away .
33979	0	a	You find out information .
33980	0	a	You then come back .
33981	0	a	You then discuss it .
33982	0	a	You then go and change things around , and then go back .
33983	0	a	Uh huh .
33984	0	a	Yeah .
33985	0	a	So
33986	0	a	Whereas , this time , you are really getting it from a database source ,
33987	0	a	so it is not well
33988	0	a	Anyway , so ,
33989	0	a	what do you want to put down ?
33990	0	a	I have put , seemed okay .
33991	0	a	Yeah , I suppose and then be going out and finding more information each time and then diff things will be relevant .
33992	0	a	Yeah .
33993	0	a	Yeah .
33994	0	a	Creativity , seemed okay .
33995	0	a	flow of information on on any given subject given subject sometimes disjointed .
33996	0	a	Yeah .
33997	0	a	I think it maybe could have been a slightly more creative project .
33998	0	a	I mean a remote control is not the most kind of fancy thing that you could imagine designing .
33999	0	a	Yeah , the thing itself .
34000	0	a	Have could have used a different example pel to increase create Creativity .
34001	0	a	I ca not think of a better example at the minute .
34002	0	a	Yeah .
34003	0	a	Yeah .
34004	0	a	Is this go
34005	0	a	It kind of kis fits the purpose that it was something everyone knows about and then something we can at least look at and think how we can improve on .
34006	0	a	You have to do it within a set time frame is the other thing , so
34007	0	a	I th
34008	0	a	I d
34009	1	a	But the other thing is that they are I am guessing that they are trying to use this software to to demonstrate how you could do a project .
34010	0	a	Yeah .
34011	0	a	But think like it was a bit restrictive just to say that you have to design a television remote control , in a way .
34012	0	a	I mean it depends what sort of business you are in , I guess .
34013	0	a	I mean this one seems .
34014	0	a	From the website it looks it is quite innovative , but we are coming up with some bucket shop product are not we that is , you know , fifteen quid .
34015	0	a	one of those things .
34016	0	a	Like , companies can have like a range of products and I do not know how it works
34017	0	a	but I guess that something got sent out and have like a brief to kind of
34018	0	a	Yeah .
34019	0	a	I mean , m my wife at the moment , for instance , is acting as a computer
34020	0	a	for
34021	0	a	you normally , you got a problem , so you go to your tutor and find out information to see how to get it fixed .
34022	0	a	Yeah .
34023	0	a	So what she is doing is she is having to spend a day at the computer terminal at one end so that any student that comes along can ask whatever question .
34024	0	a	And then you
34025	0	a	or the idea is that the whichever person is at the other end can point them in the right direction ,
34026	0	a	show them where to
34027	0	a	either give them directly give them help , or secondly , point them in the right direction , either at the library , or or or come back , or go and see Joe Bloggs , or whatever .
34028	0	a	So , and that was a project I suspect similar to this , because they they were actually trying to debug the computer software to enable to enable it to work .
34029	0	a	And of course , you had the machine crashing and various things going wrong .
34030	1	a	Well , sh we look at the last slide , see if it is got anything else .
34031	0	a	So
34032	0	a	Alright ,
34033	0	a	so we have got
34034	0	a	New ideas found ,
34035	0	a	did we find any ,
34036	0	a	no .
34037	0	a	I think there is one one more to go .
34038	0	a	Yeah .
34039	0	a	I mean if you look at their products on their website here , Real Reaction , I mean it is all pretty high tech and cutting edge .
34040	0	a	And
34041	0	a	Yeah .
34042	0	a	It was quite good with this the white board , having that and the digital pens .
34043	0	a	Like , that is something that made it a little easier .
34044	0	a	Alright .
34045	0	a	Yeah .
34046	0	a	Leadership , teamwork .
34047	0	a	we did find a new idea , I mean sort of a kinetic remote control .
34048	0	a	I have never seen one of them before .
34049	0	a	batteries , I think .
34050	0	a	So
34051	0	a	yeah .
34052	0	a	Does
34053	0	a	You have got voice recognition computers , that is not remote controls .
34054	0	a	voice recognition , especially not could
34055	0	a	Yeah .
34056	0	a	Yeah .
34057	0	a	Well it is a different application of it .
34058	0	a	Yeah , so it is just like the same products , but just put together in a different way .
34059	0	a	Okay ,
34060	0	a	so how do you reckon teamwork went ?
34061	0	a	To go reasonably well .
34062	0	a	Yeah ,
34063	0	a	I guess we all had separate ideas and then discussed them .
34064	0	a	That went okay , yeah .
34065	0	a	, yeah .
34066	0	a	Yeah .
34067	0	a	Okay .
34068	0	a	I do not think sort of the budget allowed us to do anything
34069	0	a	Well , I mean I do not think it
34070	0	a	I just do not think it fitted in with the rest of their products .
34071	0	a	Bit bit arbitrary .
34072	0	a	I mean , they have got all these sort of , you know , high definition DVD and portable seven inch
34073	0	a	d lightweight computer screens , and I am thinking , do you know , one cheap remote control does not really fit in .
34074	0	a	Surely they they should produ
34075	0	a	Yeah .
34076	0	a	So , we are m we are meant to comment on leadership and the means , E G whiteboard , digital pens , et cetera .
34077	0	a	Well leadership is a bit of a funny one , is not it .
34078	0	a	And and new i new ideas found was the the other thing .
34079	0	a	But we ca not really all fairly comment on leadership because you are the Project Manager .
34080	0	a	You were the leader .
34081	0	a	So our experience of leadership was not really as much as yours .
34082	0	a	Yeah .
34083	0	a	Yeah .
34084	0	a	Now , I would much rather be in marketing
34085	0	a	but
34086	0	a	I certainly did not get this computer to work as well as I would have liked .
34087	0	a	However ,
34088	0	a	Alright means , so whiteboard so really , it is equipment .
34089	0	a	Oh .
34090	0	a	Yeah .
34091	0	a	It worked .
34092	0	a	Yeah , very nice .
34093	0	a	Comput computers could be a bit difficult at times
34094	0	a	but I think there is a little there is a little chi
34095	0	a	There is a little there is a little chip , I think you must plug it into something
34096	0	a	and it produces a
34097	0	a	I do not know .
34098	0	a	But I mean , I d I do not I am not sure I see the value in these .
34099	0	a	I mean , they record what you are writing ,
34100	0	a	and then what do you do with it ?
34101	0	a	Where do you get the recording ?
34102	0	a	Do you plug the computer or something ?
34103	0	a	Right .
34104	0	a	So it is not just for us , it is for the experiment as a whole , so
34105	1	a	Should we quickly look at the last slide ?
34106	0	a	Sh
34107	0	a	I think you watch a video of it kind of .
34108	1	a	Whether it just produces a big image of sort of everything you have written or something ,
34109	0	a	and Page after page .
34110	0	a	Right .
34111	0	a	New ideas found , so one or two .
34112	0	a	Yeah .
34113	0	a	Kinetic powered remote control .
34114	0	a	what was the other one ?
34115	0	a	Vo
34116	0	a	yeah .
34117	0	a	Voice recognition thing .
34118	0	a	and voice
34119	0	a	, was it voice activated
34120	0	a	recognition .
34121	0	a	Voice recognition , yeah .
34122	0	a	S Almost .
34123	0	a	To fill in these fill in these questionnaires
34124	0	a	Oh no .
34125	0	a	Right , so ,
34126	0	a	are the costs within budget ,
34127	0	a	yes .
34128	0	a	Is the project evaluated ,
34129	0	a	yes .
34130	0	a	, do not forget to complete final questionnaire and meeting summary .
34131	0	a	Then celebration .
34132	0	a	Yeah .
34133	0	a	, so we do not re So really
34134	0	a	I tried to save this the last time at twelve point three , and it did not seem to have saved anywhere .
34135	0	a	Mind you , the the figure last was was different ,
34136	0	a	 
34137	0	a	Alright , that did nothing .
34138	0	a	Okay .
34139	0	a	Welcome to the meeting everyone .
34140	1	a	Just going to attempt to make this into a slide show .
34141	0	a	Sorry guys .
34142	1	a	You may have to do the function F eight thing .
34143	0	a	I did .
34144	0	a	Oh , okay .
34145	0	a	Twice .
34146	0	a	This will just take a moment .
34147	0	a	Okay okay
34148	0	a	Okay .
34149	0	a	Or it wo not .
34150	0	a	Okay we will have to deal with it like this then .
34151	0	a	Alright .
34152	0	a	This is the first meeting for developing our , our new product .
34153	0	a	I am Heather , I am your Project Manager .
34154	0	a	Hello .
34155	0	a	Okay .
34156	0	a	So .
34157	0	a	So that was the opening .
34158	1	a	The first thing we will do is get acquainted with one another .
34159	1	a	If everyone could go around and explain their role and , and their name .
34160	0	a	Okay .
34161	0	a	My name is Poppy .
34162	0	a	I am the Industrial Designer for this project .
34163	1	a	, I am going to be responsible for the functional design phase .
34164	1	a	Also the conceptual design and the detailed design for the final product .
34165	0	a	Nice to meet you Poppy .
34166	0	a	Okay .
34167	0	a	My name is Tara
34168	0	a	and I am the User Interface Designer .
34169	1	a	I will also be responsible for the functional design phase , the conceptual design phase and the detailed design phase of the user interface design .
34170	0	a	Alright .
34171	0	a	Hi ,
34172	0	a	I am Genevieve .
34173	0	a	I am the Marketing Expert .
34174	0	a	I am an expert at marketing .
34175	1	a	, I will be telling you guys about the user requirement specifications for our new product .
34176	1	a	, I will be doing some trend watching in the conceptual design , and product evaluation for the design phase .
34177	0	a	Alright I am Heather
34178	0	a	and I have
34179	0	a	I said I am your Project Manager ,
34180	0	a	Well you can pretty much read what it is that I am doing .
34181	0	a	But Yeah .
34182	0	a	And tool training is one thing that we are going to be doing today , as well as planning the project , how we are going to , , create this product , and , , discuss , , our aims and objects of this , Which brings us to our next subject ,
34183	0	a	is , , ,
34184	0	a	as a team we are going to be designing and creating a new kind of remote control .
34185	0	a	, we want this to be a marketable product that can be trendy , , a completely new style , so that , , can really appeal to a , to a generation that does not want a simple plain kind of , , channel changer .
34186	0	a	And , , it needs to be user friendly for , , maybe , for an example , for people that , , ca not see the numbers as well , or , , perhaps an ergonomic design .
34187	0	a	Okay .
34188	0	a	So this is a television remote control ?
34189	0	a	Yeah .
34190	0	a	Yes , it is a television remote control .
34191	0	a	Right .
34192	0	a	I believe I should be taking minutes on this right now .
34193	0	a	So , alright .
34194	0	a	Okay .
34195	0	a	, yeah .
34196	1	a	, the way that we are going to go about this is , , we will have a time where we can , come up with new ideas alone , and , and work on the project and then , , after we have brainstormed and , and thought about , we can come together in a meeting and , and discuss what , what , what kind of functional design we want to use .
34197	0	a	Same with conceptual design and detailed design .
34198	0	a	So , ,
34199	0	a	making sure that it , it is usable ,
34200	0	a	that as a ,
34201	0	a	and that it is , it is feasible to create , and , to come up with a concept of it want , what we want it to look like .
34202	0	a	, tool training .
34203	0	a	Is , is everyone ,
34204	0	a	Okay .
34205	0	a	Yeah .
34206	0	a	Got those notes .
34207	0	a	Yeah .
34208	0	a	Thank you .
34209	0	a	Great .
34210	0	a	Great .
34211	1	a	One thing that , , we are going to do is become more acquainted with the , the tools that we have access to for our project .
34212	0	a	, one of them is our whiteboard .
34213	1	a	And , , as a sort of team building moment , , I , I would like us to , , try out the whiteboard by expressing our favourite animal and the charac characteristics of that animal .
34214	0	a	, why that , why that should be your favourite animal .
34215	0	a	So , , I ,
34216	1	a	I am assuming that we should do that now .
34217	0	a	Okay .
34218	0	a	Kay .
34219	0	a	With our microphones still attached to our bodies .
34220	0	a	Okay .
34221	0	a	Gosh .
34222	0	a	Okay .
34223	0	a	Kay , what is my favourite animal ?
34224	1	a	Do come up .
34225	0	a	Oh ,
34226	0	a	to go first .
34227	0	a	Oh ,
34228	0	a	are we all doing it individually ?
34229	0	a	Okay ,
34230	1	a	let is stand up and support you
34231	0	a	Okay .
34232	0	a	This is a team building time
34233	0	a	where , , ,
34234	0	a	okay cool ,
34235	0	a	My favourite animal , which changes all the time , okay ,
34236	0	a	right now it is an elk .
34237	0	a	Yeah .
34238	0	a	An elk ?
34239	0	a	A vicious
34240	0	a	We have sheep .
34241	0	a	alright , so
34242	0	a	And it goes like
34243	0	a	Yeah it is got like big antlers ,
34244	0	a	yeah .
34245	0	a	Looks kind of like , like it has holly growing out of its head .
34246	0	a	Do you have elk where you come from ?
34247	0	a	You do .
34248	0	a	Yes .
34249	0	a	Yeah we have moose and we have deer .
34250	0	a	We have moose too .
34251	0	a	Okay .
34252	0	a	Do you have
34253	0	a	Kay , .
34254	0	a	Sheep .
34255	0	a	Yeah ,
34256	0	a	cows .
34257	0	a	That is a great elk .
34258	0	a	Uh oh , we have a good artist .
34259	0	a	That is really good .
34260	0	a	Yeah .
34261	0	a	I am quite
34262	0	a	Very good .
34263	0	a	Thanks .
34264	0	a	This is my
34265	0	a	Okay .
34266	0	a	Oh ,
34267	0	a	very shapely .
34268	0	a	Brilliant .
34269	0	a	That is a sketching of my my elk , and it , it is my favourite animal right now , cause it is a large beautiful majestic creature ,
34270	0	a	that , that
34271	0	a	In a way it looks kind of awkward , because it is on spindly legs
34272	0	a	and it
34273	0	a	But it can really overcome harsh terrain , and although it is gorgeous it is also very dangerous , because it has strong antlers ,
34274	0	a	and
34275	0	a	it can really combat its enemies , even like it it is a it is an herbivore but , , it can really defend itself .
34276	0	a	Very nice .
34277	0	a	Yeah .
34278	0	a	Okay .
34279	0	a	Right .
34280	0	a	Right ,
34281	1	a	I am going to take minutes
34282	1	a	while , , you guys express your favourite animals .
34283	1	a	Okay , I will go next .
34284	0	a	I am a big animal lover .
34285	0	a	like all sorts of animals , but for the moment I am going to draw a cat , in memory of my poor cat that died recently .
34286	0	a	Oh .
34287	0	a	Oh .
34288	0	a	It is going to be a bit of a strange drawing ,
34289	0	a	but never mind .
34290	0	a	Not as artistic as Heather is drawing .
34291	0	a	Bit more cartoon style .
34292	0	a	But I like cats because they are so independent , and they always seem to be doing what they want to be doing .
34293	0	a	, but that does not mean they are completely not sociable , cause they enjoy interacting with humans as well , and they seem to enjoy the good things like sunshine and , , running around outside as well as being inside , and enjoying their food , and generally just , they just seemed so cool
34294	0	a	and they just know what they are doing .
34295	0	a	I reckon they are sort of , they got it sorted .
34296	0	a	They know what they want .
34297	0	a	Basically , that is why I like cats .
34298	0	a	Great .
34299	1	a	I will rub that out .
34300	0	a	There you go .
34301	0	a	Okay .
34302	0	a	I think my favourite animal would be a dog , but I am not really sure how to draw one .
34303	0	a	Ooh .
34304	0	a	I , I have never drawn a dog , I do not think .
34305	0	a	I am tempted to draw a snail cause I draw them sometimes and they are really easy to draw .
34306	0	a	, right
34307	0	a	it is going to be a really funny dog , cause I am not sure how to draw a dog .
34308	0	a	I forget her name .
34309	0	a	Tara or Tara .
34310	0	a	Well there are loads of different types of dogs , so I am sure it will represent one kind of dog .
34311	0	a	It is a cartoon dog I think .
34312	0	a	A s I do not ev
34313	0	a	Oh , oh well .
34314	0	a	It is a scary cartoon dog .
34315	0	a	That This ,
34316	0	a	that does not look like a dog .
34317	0	a	It looks kind of like a person .
34318	0	a	I am sorry .
34319	1	a	We can pretend .
34320	0	a	That is Pinocchio .
34321	0	a	How do you draw a dog ?
34322	0	a	I suppose it has a lon
34323	0	a	Oh my god .
34324	0	a	Right .
34325	0	a	Yous know what it is supposed to be .
34326	0	a	It is a dog .
34327	0	a	Okay .
34328	0	a	, I like dogs because , , they are so good to humans , like they can be trained to be police dogs and seeing eye dogs , and they are just such friendly animals .
34329	0	a	And , like they are more of a companion than cats .
34330	0	a	I have nothing against cats .
34331	0	a	Yeah , that is true .
34332	0	a	Cats do not really like me , so I ca not like them .
34333	0	a	But they are just so friendly and warm and nice animals , that do not look like that .
34334	0	a	Alrighty .
34335	0	a	I feel like a robot .
34336	0	a	Okay .
34337	0	a	well I guess I had the most time to think about it .
34338	1	a	I am going to draw a butterfly ,
34339	0	a	because I saw a butterfly yesterday , that seemed to be like the symbol of Spring arriving .
34340	0	a	And it was actually the prettiest butterfly I have ever seen out in the wild , and I though that was pretty cool in Scotland .
34341	0	a	It was like , well it was a little pointier than that .
34342	0	a	At first I thought it was a dead leaf .
34343	0	a	And then it landed on the wall next to me .
34344	0	a	But this part was all brown and then it has these big blue dots like this .
34345	0	a	And then it kind of
34346	0	a	there was a green , I think it was a green ring , and there was like red going out like this .
34347	0	a	It is kind of like a peacock .
34348	0	a	Yeah , it kind of was actually ,
34349	0	a	cause it was
34350	0	a	This part of the body was really dull , and then it was the most colourful exotic butterfly ever , and I am like , wow this is the middle of Scotland in like March .
34351	0	a	So I thought that was pretty cool .
34352	0	a	And it landed by a wall and let me look at it for about two minutes .
34353	0	a	I wish I would had my camera .
34354	0	a	So that is going to be my favourite animal because after all the snow it seemed to say that like Spring is finally here .
34355	0	a	Yeah .
34356	0	a	There you go .
34357	0	a	Very nice .
34358	0	a	Great .
34359	0	a	, what do we
34360	0	a	Oh .
34361	0	a	Do you hear the eraser buzzing while you do that ?
34362	0	a	Yea
34363	0	a	Right .
34364	0	a	Yes I do .
34365	0	a	So , now that we know how to use the whiteboard ,
34366	1	a	, the next , , thing we need to address is our financial department , to meet our our budget ,
34367	0	a	or not meet our budget but more , , like what kind of , , selling range we will be looking at , , want to make this selling price of twenty five Euros .
34368	0	a	Okay .
34369	1	a	And so we have to , , come up with a way to , to create a , a remote control , where we can like the price to create it will be significantly less .
34370	0	a	, we would like to , to , , make fifty million Euro .
34371	0	a	I am assuming that is what the M means .
34372	0	a	, and make it for an international market .
34373	1	a	, one thing we would have to think about internationally is in the design of , , like different kinds of , , VCRs .
34374	0	a	Things like that , depending on which country you are .
34375	0	a	Another thing for the design team to think about .
34376	0	a	, we want it to cost , , absolute maximum of twelve Euro and fifty cents .
34377	0	a	Okay ,
34378	0	a	so we will have a hundred percent profit then ?
34379	0	a	Twelve fifty .
34380	0	a	I am bad at math .
34381	0	a	Okay .
34382	0	a	Kay .
34383	0	a	so now that , , that is underway , it is discussion time .
34384	0	a	So this is time for us to bring our initial ideas , any suggestions that you may have so far , a your personal experiences with remote controls , and , , areas you see that , , could be improved in your experience with them .
34385	1	a	Does anyone have any initial thoughts ?
34386	0	a	I find that in the dark it is often hard to know what button you are pushing .
34387	1	a	So what is something we could , , do to remedy that ?
34388	0	a	Yeah .
34389	0	a	Okay .
34390	0	a	I always find that in our house the remote control always goes missing .
34391	0	a	It is always , where is the remote control ?
34392	1	a	So maybe if you could have some kind of tracking device for the remote control or some signal that you could find out where it was .
34393	0	a	Yeah .
34394	0	a	I dunno ,
34395	1	a	some kind of alarm .
34396	1	a	You can press a button on your wall , signal ,
34397	0	a	cause it always gets lost .
34398	0	a	It is a great idea .
34399	0	a	It is a great idea .
34400	0	a	Do yous not find that , , like , there is a lot of , , buttons on your remote control , and you do not know what half of them do .
34401	0	a	Yeah .
34402	0	a	Yeah , that you do not use half of them .
34403	0	a	Yeah , I do not know what they do .
34404	0	a	There is some remote controls where there is kind of a hidden panel , so all those buttons that you do not really use unless you are programming or something .
34405	0	a	Yeah .
34406	0	a	Yeah ,
34407	0	a	that is , that is
34408	0	a	Yeah , it is .
34409	0	a	That is useful .
34410	0	a	So you just have like the number buttons , power button , TV video button .
34411	0	a	Yeah .
34412	0	a	Yeah .
34413	0	a	Yeah .
34414	0	a	Alright .
34415	1	a	Anything about , , the look of the , , remote control that you might have ideas about .
34416	1	a	Maybe it could be , instead of like a standard rectangular shape , it could be , , something more interesting like
34417	0	a	Any ideas will do that you have at this point .
34418	1	a	Could be shaped like a conch ,
34419	0	a	you know .
34420	1	a	Be like a shell shaped remote .
34421	0	a	Can hold it .
34422	0	a	A novelty .
34423	0	a	Are we going into kind of novelty factors here .
34424	0	a	Yeah .
34425	0	a	Like , I have seen phones like a
34426	0	a	Okay .
34427	0	a	Well if it is a trendy original , , aspect we are going for .
34428	1	a	I mean , you are the designers ,
34429	1	a	you c , you can decide what kind of , , direction you want to go in ,
34430	0	a	but at this point in the , in the first meeting it can be any ideas that we just throw out there .
34431	0	a	Yeah .
34432	0	a	Yeah .
34433	0	a	Yeah .
34434	1	a	I suppose , if we are he heading to have it , like make a huge profit out of this , it needs to be quite a universally accepted thing .
34435	0	a	Like , a novelty thing might only sell a few things rather than , like , a general kind of more acceptable
34436	1	a	But we do not want to go towards boring , cause that would not sell either .
34437	0	a	So , .
34438	0	a	Yeah .
34439	0	a	And the key issue here is , is being trendy and original .
34440	0	a	Yeah .
34441	0	a	, that does not necessarily mean it needs to be outrageous .
34442	0	a	Yeah .
34443	0	a	Right .
34444	0	a	Okay we have five minutes left .
34445	0	a	So , just to cover
34446	0	a	We have one more thing .
34447	1	a	, like you can go over your ideas , of course , in your own personal times .
34448	0	a	Yeah .
34449	0	a	, our next meeting will be in half an hour .
34450	1	a	So you have half an hour to , , think about what you want to present .
34451	0	a	Or not present but bring to the meeting .
34452	0	a	, ID , whatever that stands for .
34453	0	a	Interface ?
34454	0	a	Oh , industrial .
34455	0	a	Industrial Designer .
34456	0	a	Industrial Designer .
34457	0	a	That is me .
34458	1	a	I have to remember these things .
34459	1	a	You will be beginning your , your working design .
34460	1	a	, UID the technical functions design will , will be worked on the next thirty minutes .
34461	0	a	, maybe how this can be achieved , and , , we need the user requirements from the manag
34462	0	a	Marketing Expert .
34463	0	a	, you will get specific instructions , , of what to do in the next half an hour .
34464	0	a	And I will see you in half an hour ,
34465	0	a	okay ?
34466	0	a	Okay .
34467	0	a	 
34468	0	a	Okay .
34469	0	a	Yeah .
34470	0	a	That is okay .
34471	0	a	That is okay .
34472	0	a	Okay .
34473	0	a	Am I starting now ?
34474	0	a	Anytime ?
34475	0	a	Oh sorry .
34476	0	a	Kay , .
34477	0	a	Alright ,
34478	0	a	welcome back fro to the second meeting .
34479	0	a	And I hope you had a productive last thirty minutes .
34480	0	a	, and ,
34481	1	a	I will be taking minutes on this one ,
34482	0	a	and Being hooked up to the PowerPoint for this meeting is not very necessary for myself , because it will be more about , what you guys are bringing to the meeting today .
34483	0	a	, so ,
34484	0	a	the first presentation we will be looking at is Poppy is presentation .
34485	0	a	And , So ,
34486	0	a	sorry ?
34487	0	a	So , ,
34488	1	a	take it away Poppy .
34489	1	a	Okay .
34490	0	a	, do I need to
34491	0	a	plugged in .
34492	0	a	It is , it is plugged in .
34493	0	a	So ,
34494	0	a	No problem .
34495	0	a	F eight , w .
34496	0	a	Function F eight .
34497	0	a	F okay .
34498	0	a	Function F eight .
34499	0	a	Sorry about this guys .
34500	0	a	Kay .
34501	0	a	is on .
34502	0	a	Right .
34503	0	a	Okay .
34504	0	a	I will take this time just to apologise .
34505	0	a	I , I only , , received my emails later on .
34506	0	a	Cause I was too busy carried away doing my own thing ,
34507	0	a	which is not obviously not a very good part of a team working thing .
34508	0	a	But there we go .
34509	0	a	I am sure it is fine .
34510	0	a	, so I was looking at how we are going to go about the working design , and what we actually need to do , and what the remote control needs to do .
34511	0	a	And it needs to allow a person to have a portable desi device , so they can control the television from wherever they are .
34512	0	a	They do not need to actually manually touch the television set .
34513	0	a	So , it gives them much more flexibility , and allows them to be where they want to be .
34514	0	a	, from
34515	0	a	, on a functional side of things , we found out that wh from our previous meeting , we decided that there are certain points that will make our product unique .
34516	0	a	, one is the visibility in the dark , which was Genevieve is idea .
34517	1	a	So we need to think about how we could bring this in technically .
34518	1	a	And we could use illuminated buttons ,
34519	0	a	which we are all familiar with when we are using a mobile phone , or something fam familiar .
34520	0	a	A automatically , lights up at first touch .
34521	1	a	Or we could use fluorescent materials
34522	0	a	which would just take in the light during the day , and then as soon as they go off they would glow in the dark .
34523	1	a	, also we could use an alarm .
34524	0	a	So if we lost the remote control , perhaps there could be a button on the television set itself , which you could press , and then an alarm from the handset would sound where it was , hopefully in the room .
34525	0	a	Maybe behind a cushion or somewhere .
34526	0	a	, so that would work .
34527	0	a	oop .
34528	0	a	Go back there .
34529	0	a	, another thing I think we d missed out on on the last meeting was the fact that we should consider the environmental impact of our design .
34530	0	a	, from previous researches I have carried out on other projects , we have learnt about smart materials where specific alloys of metals have a shape memory .
34531	0	a	So they can be heated and and cooled , and they change the shape of the metal .
34532	0	a	So , for example , a screw that is holding something together could expand and it would force all the components apart .
34533	0	a	So , the benefits of this for our product would be that when it came to the end of its product life , if it was heated , everything would spring apart .
34534	0	a	So , all the individual components could be easily separated , and then some could be reused , some could be recycled ,
34535	0	a	and I think that would be very important for products now .
34536	0	a	Especially cause there is much responsibility for all the companies who are coming up with like new designs .
34537	0	a	Cause all ,
34538	0	a	we all know that our resources are being limited , and we have to be very environmentally conscious .
34539	0	a	Right , , one question .
34540	0	a	Yeah .
34541	0	a	This , , self destructible metal , it allows for recycling materials ?
34542	0	a	So that , , someone could have this product for as long as they felt that they wanted it , and then once they contribute it , then that company can break down the part , the parts better ?
34543	0	a	Yeah .
34544	0	a	And then
34545	0	a	Yeah .
34546	0	a	Yeah
34547	0	a	they would ,
34548	0	a	you would make the , the product as you normally would , apart from the , the bits that hold it all together would be made out of this shape memory alloy .
34549	0	a	And that is the part that would allow all the other parts to be separated at the end .
34550	0	a	I mean , the user would return the p product to the company , cause it is the product is responsibility to get rid of what they have made .
34551	0	a	, and then the company could then just use , make use of this shape memory alloys to split up the components , and then either reuse some bits , and other bits which are obviously going to wear out with time , or not usable
34552	0	a	, they might be like be able to put into scrap metal .
34553	0	a	Something like the case , if it is scratched or something , you would want to reuse it , but you might be able to melt it down and reuse it again somewhere else .
34554	0	a	Would we be the company that would break down these , or metals ?
34555	0	a	Or would we contribute to another group ?
34556	0	a	Alright .
34557	0	a	You could
34558	1	a	we could probably empl em employ a , a side company or something to do that for us .
34559	0	a	But it would be our responsibility to get that done and to dispose of the products that we made .
34560	0	a	For a certain percentage at least .
34561	0	a	Not every , not a hundred percent of everything we produce ,
34562	0	a	but
34563	0	a	Yeah .
34564	0	a	Okay .
34565	0	a	This sounds like a really great idea .
34566	0	a	One thing we have to consider is our one hundred percent turnover goal that we have for our financial sector .
34567	0	a	Yeah .
34568	1	a	, so we will have to investigate how much that will cost us , cost the company ,
34569	0	a	cause it sounds very labour intensive .
34570	0	a	Yeah .
34571	0	a	You would have to hire a number of people , and it might be more expensive .
34572	0	a	Well I
34573	0	a	the fact of the shape memory alloys is that they , they do not need to be manually de deconstructed .
34574	0	a	Like , you do not have to individually unscrew all the screws .
34575	0	a	Because of this , their properties are smart material .
34576	0	a	All you need is just the heat , so they self destruct themselves .
34577	0	a	Alright .
34578	0	a	So I suppose it does need like high contact ,
34579	0	a	yeah ,
34580	0	a	you know high quality machinery , and very specific machinery ,
34581	0	a	but
34582	0	a	Yeah .
34583	0	a	We will still have to investigate the financial implications .
34584	0	a	Alright .
34585	0	a	I like the environmental approach .
34586	1	a	, we will have to see if that can meet our financial goals as well .
34587	0	a	Okay .
34588	0	a	also there is components .
34589	0	a	This will be how it will actually work .
34590	0	a	But I have not put this plan together yet .
34591	0	a	I am sorry ,
34592	1	a	could you
34593	0	a	Those were
34594	0	a	Okay .
34595	0	a	There we go
34596	0	a	Sorry ,
34597	0	a	should I go back .
34598	0	a	This would actually show the circuit diagram .
34599	0	a	Although I have not come up with the final circuit yet .
34600	0	a	So I just put all those components in .
34601	0	a	So those are what , , we will c construct the remote .
34602	0	a	Those are all the
34603	0	a	Alright .
34604	0	a	Yeah .
34605	0	a	I it just shows what sort of energy source .
34606	0	a	It could be a battery , like rechargeable probably .
34607	0	a	, a not yeah , well
34608	0	a	how the infrared will actually be sent through the chip to be received by the chip on the television set itself .
34609	0	a	Great .
34610	0	a	Okay ?
34611	0	a	So , now is it F eight again to escape ?
34612	0	a	Or escape ?
34613	0	a	There we go .
34614	0	a	Okay .
34615	0	a	Alright .
34616	0	a	Thank you very much .
34617	0	a	Thank you .
34618	0	a	And , , the next presenter will be Tara .
34619	0	a	There you go Tara .
34620	0	a	Thanks .
34621	0	a	Can you see ?
34622	0	a	Do you think
34623	0	a	Is it , function eight
34624	0	a	yeah ?
34625	0	a	Oh right .
34626	0	a	Oh ,
34627	0	a	Function F eight .
34628	0	a	Yeah .
34629	0	a	Function F eight .
34630	0	a	Function F eight .
34631	0	a	Sorry .
34632	0	a	The one at the top .
34633	0	a	Okay .
34634	0	a	That looks right .
34635	0	a	Yeah .
34636	0	a	Okay .
34637	0	a	I am the User User Interface Designer .
34638	0	a	, the technical functions design of the apparatus is the effect the apparatus should have .
34639	0	a	, in this case it is the function of the remote control , which is to send messages to the television , television set .
34640	0	a	By taking inspiration from other similar designs , we will try and come up with an original trendy remote control , which is sellable international .
34641	0	a	There are two functional design options .
34642	0	a	A multifunctional remote control , which can be used for several entertainment devices .
34643	0	a	And a single function remote control , used specifically for the television .
34644	0	a	I am sorry ,
34645	0	a	what was that last one .
34646	0	a	Multifunctional and Ch
34647	0	a	Oh , I see .
34648	0	a	Sorry .
34649	0	a	, a single function just for the television itself .
34650	0	a	Yeah .
34651	0	a	, multifunctional controls can be difficult to use , as the multitude of buttons can be confusing .
34652	0	a	A single function remote control is simpler to use , but it means you have to have other remote controls for your other entertainment devices .
34653	0	a	Kay .
34654	0	a	, I think that a single function remote control would be preferable ,
34655	0	a	because it is easier to use .
34656	0	a	It would be more compatible with a range of television sets , making it more internationally sellable .
34657	0	a	, it will make an original design more obtainable , as we have less functional necessities to include in the design .
34658	0	a	And it would be more profitable as it would be more simplistic .
34659	0	a	And less functions would have to be included .
34660	0	a	So it would be cheaper to make .
34661	0	a	And probably more sellable just because it is more compatible with a r a wider range of devices .
34662	0	a	Does anyone have any questions ?
34663	0	a	Well , it is just that , when we are creating it , we are , we have to make it compatible with different brands of devices .
34664	0	a	So as far as we know , , a single function television remote control is us usable internationally ?
34665	0	a	Right .
34666	0	a	And it would be easier to make it compatible with just different brands of television devices rather than other ent ,
34667	0	a	yeah ,
34668	0	a	other entertainment devices .
34669	0	a	DVDs and VCR ?
34670	0	a	Okay .
34671	0	a	Right .
34672	0	a	Does everyone agree with this ?
34673	0	a	Does anyone object and , and find the multifunctional might be a better way to go ?
34674	0	a	, I was just wondering about the , what , what Genevieve said before , about having like some hidden controls like having the outer casing .
34675	0	a	And that would probably , , I d , well well what you said before about it being a more profitable simplistic design .
34676	0	a	I suppose having that would complicate it a lot more .
34677	0	a	Yeah .
34678	0	a	Yeah .
34679	0	a	And limit the design .
34680	0	a	Do you think ?
34681	0	a	Yeah .
34682	0	a	Yeah , I think I agree with the single design thing for now ,
34683	0	a	because we are trying to do so much , that if we are trying to make a unique , user friendly , dadada , and it is also multi also multifunctional , , we are going to go over budget for one thing .
34684	0	a	So
34685	0	a	Yeah .
34686	0	a	Yeah .
34687	0	a	That is true .
34688	0	a	Yeah .
34689	0	a	Yeah .
34690	0	a	And with this we will have more room in the budget probably to make a more original design .
34691	0	a	Yeah .
34692	0	a	We will have more money to go into the design side of it .
34693	0	a	Yeah .
34694	0	a	Okay .
34695	0	a	Yeah .
34696	0	a	Alright .
34697	0	a	Sounds great .
34698	0	a	, kay .
34699	0	a	Alright , well , ,
34700	0	a	are you ready for your presentation Genevieve ?
34701	0	a	Fabulous .
34702	0	a	Yes I am .
34703	0	a	Except you are not hooked up to the
34704	0	a	Great .
34705	0	a	Oh ,
34706	0	a	I am not hooked up , but other than that , completely ready .
34707	0	a	Okay .
34708	0	a	Okay .
34709	0	a	Oh .
34710	0	a	I just lost my microphone .
34711	0	a	No problem ,
34712	0	a	we can
34713	0	a	I am sorry ,
34714	0	a	what was that last thing that you just said ?
34715	0	a	Just a moment .
34716	1	a	Okay .
34717	1	a	So I will be discussing the functional requirements of this remote control .
34718	1	a	, and I will give you a little briefing on what that means exactly .
34719	0	a	, if you all remember from the email we got before our very first kick off meeting , with the coffee machine ?
34720	0	a	The functional requirements of that was to produce hot coffee quickly .
34721	0	a	, so what I will be talking about now is the equivalent for a remote control .
34722	0	a	, so basically what needs and desires are to be fulfilled .
34723	0	a	, I have done some marketing research , a lot of interviews with remote control users , , and some internet research .
34724	1	a	And I will show you my findings .
34725	0	a	Oh ,
34726	0	a	and firstly I wanted to remind you about our company motto and purpose .
34727	0	a	So we believe in providing international market with fashionable products .
34728	0	a	, hence our motto , we put the fashion in electronics .
34729	0	a	So I think that should be our priority here .
34730	1	a	, and we should also be looking to trends in clothing and interior design .
34731	1	a	Not just in electronic fashion .
34732	0	a	So that it is something that fits in the household .
34733	0	a	, we should be looking towards trends in both clothing and interior design .
34734	0	a	Any trends that are going on in , in the public , even media , you know who is famous , what TV shows are being watched , , to influence our remote control .
34735	0	a	Yeah .
34736	0	a	Okay , so the findings .
34737	0	a	, seventy five percent of users of remote controls find them ugly .
34738	0	a	Which is a , quite a significant number .
34739	0	a	, the other twenty five percent did not specify if they love them or found them , you know , neutral .
34740	0	a	Eighty percent of users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy .
34741	0	a	Current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour of the user .
34742	0	a	I am sorry ,
34743	0	a	that eighty percent of users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy .
34744	0	a	You mean that they would spend more money on a fancy looking remote control ?
34745	0	a	Okay .
34746	0	a	Yeah , they are willing , they are willing to spend money on a remote control with personality .
34747	0	a	As opposed to your basic , you know , oval black , all same size button remote control .
34748	0	a	Yeah .
34749	0	a	, so it is something that people care about .
34750	0	a	It is not , it is not ignored in the household .
34751	0	a	, seventy five percent of remote control users said that they zap a lot .
34752	0	a	Zapping meaning they go through channels a lot .
34753	0	a	They are you know thumb masters .
34754	0	a	, and fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons .
34755	0	a	That A very small amount .
34756	0	a	Thought that was interesting .
34757	0	a	Alright ,
34758	1	a	so it might be very appealing if , , we have very concise buttons .
34759	1	a	the single function .
34760	1	a	And another thing with lots of surfing , we would probably have to work on something that could be a lot more durable ,
34761	0	a	because I find with channel changers that , , a lot of the numbers get rubbed down if they are printed on the button .
34762	0	a	Yeah .
34763	0	a	Yes .
34764	0	a	Yeah .
34765	0	a	Yeah that is a good point .
34766	0	a	Yeah .
34767	1	a	And actually to go with that , I am going to give you some statistics on the relevancy of the buttons , how much they are used .
34768	0	a	And how important the users find them .
34769	0	a	So the power button , obviously , in an hour is only used once .
34770	0	a	Hopefully the person is not turning on and off the TV .
34771	0	a	, but the relevance of that button is nine out of ten .
34772	0	a	So people want to be able to turn on the TV with the remote control .
34773	0	a	, as opposed to standing up and turning on the television set .
34774	0	a	Channel selection is used a hundred and sixty eight times on average per hour .
34775	0	a	That is a huge amount .
34776	0	a	This is the most important button .
34777	0	a	, so obviously when commercials come on they are changing it , so as you said we want a durable button that is not going to run down .
34778	0	a	Relevance of that button , our users found was ten , ten out of ten .
34779	0	a	, ditto for volume selection , so ten out of ten .
34780	0	a	And it is used on average four times an hour .
34781	0	a	Not as much as channel selection , but still significant .
34782	0	a	, audio settings is used on average zero point eight times an hour .
34783	0	a	Relevance is two .
34784	0	a	Screen settings , which means brightness , colour etcetera , zero point five times an hour .
34785	0	a	, and relevance of one point five .
34786	0	a	We are getting to specific statistics here .
34787	0	a	Teletext , , now I am not too clear on what that is .
34788	0	a	I do not know if you can help me .
34789	0	a	Flipping pages .
34790	0	a	Is that
34791	0	a	So like a running banner , underneath
34792	0	a	Oh .
34793	0	a	It is
34794	0	a	It has
34795	0	a	TV has like information , it has information on holidays , the news , entertainment .
34796	0	a	It is like the news .
34797	0	a	Or like information .
34798	0	a	Yeah .
34799	0	a	The
34800	0	a	and what is on .
34801	0	a	It is
34802	0	a	No it is a button that you press , and then you , , like a menu pops up .
34803	0	a	No ,
34804	0	a	li
34805	0	a	Yeah .
34806	0	a	Yeah .
34807	0	a	I have not used it before
34808	0	a	but
34809	0	a	It is like
34810	0	a	It is like very basic internet .
34811	0	a	And you have page numbers like for the menu , and you press the page numbers with your remote , and it , it will come up .
34812	0	a	Okay .
34813	0	a	Very basic internet , yeah .
34814	0	a	Sort of ,
34815	0	a	Yeah ,
34816	0	a	it is just information that , like television timetables , what is on , what is on now , what is on next , on every channel , and
34817	0	a	Yeah .
34818	0	a	Okay .
34819	0	a	But you have
34820	0	a	Yeah .
34821	0	a	Like tells you the weather , and
34822	0	a	Okay .
34823	0	a	But you have no interaction back with it , you know .
34824	0	a	Like the internet you can send emails and You have no interaction .
34825	0	a	Right .
34826	0	a	Yeah .
34827	0	a	Alright .
34828	0	a	Well I guess I am not with it ,
34829	0	a	because I was not
34830	0	a	But it is , it is being used fourteen times an hour .
34831	0	a	, and has a r a high relevance of six point five .
34832	0	a	So it looks like something that we are going to want to do some research on and include on our remote control .
34833	0	a	Yeah .
34834	0	a	, channel settings .
34835	0	a	Zero point zero one times an hour .
34836	0	a	Relevance of three .
34837	0	a	Channel settings .
34838	0	a	, probably just tuning in the channels ,
34839	0	a	would it be ?
34840	0	a	Tuning them in at the very start .
34841	0	a	P Sorry .
34842	0	a	Changing the channels ?
34843	0	a	Oh , okay .
34844	0	a	You know if you get a new TV set , you tune in all the channels ,
34845	0	a	do you th do you think ?
34846	0	a	Yeah .
34847	0	a	To get the right reception and picture , I suppose .
34848	0	a	Yeah .
34849	0	a	Yeah .
34850	0	a	Okay .
34851	0	a	, so it is not used very often , but people still find it relevant .
34852	0	a	Okay .
34853	0	a	, biggest frustrations of the people that we interviewed .
34854	0	a	Remote controls are often lost somewhere .
34855	0	a	So that was already discussed by Poppy .
34856	0	a	How we could have a , an alarm system so that people can find it .
34857	0	a	, takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote control .
34858	0	a	So it should be very user friendly , you know .
34859	0	a	People know what to do very quickly .
34860	0	a	, remote controls are bad for RSI .
34861	0	a	Repetitive strain injury .
34862	0	a	Repeti .
34863	0	a	I think .
34864	0	a	Is that what it is ?
34865	0	a	People with arthritis and such ?
34866	1	a	, maybe our designers can look into that .
34867	0	a	That is rather sad .
34868	0	a	Oh , I am guessing that is what it is .
34869	0	a	Yeah ,
34870	0	a	yeah .
34871	0	a	I am not
34872	0	a	I think it is .
34873	1	a	, buttons that do not require , you know , very firm pushing , if they respond .
34874	0	a	Yeah .
34875	1	a	But we will have to also avoid , you know , buttons responding to the slightest touch as well .
34876	0	a	That is a problem .
34877	0	a	Yeah .
34878	0	a	It is .
34879	0	a	Okay .
34880	0	a	Did you guys get that one down ?
34881	0	a	okay ,
34882	0	a	here is some ideas for you .
34883	0	a	Yep .
34884	0	a	A large percentage of the public would pay for voice recognition on the remote controls .
34885	1	a	So I will show you some numbers here .
34886	0	a	, so the youngest age group , fifteen to twenty five .
34887	0	a	Ninety one point two percent said that they would pay extra money to have voice recogni voice recognition included on their remote control .
34888	0	a	, and you can see that number decreases a bit with ol s
34889	0	a	Interestingly enough , twenty five to thirty five is the lowest amount .
34890	0	a	, that would , are willing to pay extra .
34891	1	a	So I guess we are going to have to figure out what age group we are , we are targeting , and if and if voice recognition is something we want to look into .
34892	1	a	And if we have the budget for it .
34893	0	a	, if we are targeting young adults , it looks like something that would pay off .
34894	0	a	Seeing as ninety percent , over ninety percent would pay for it .
34895	0	a	I agree with if we are targeting young adults then it would be something we should look into .
34896	0	a	, financially and and functionally .
34897	0	a	, and especially if we are trying to be trendy , go with fashions , things like that .
34898	0	a	, ages like from thirty five to sixty five which show lower numbers probably wo not be as concerned .
34899	0	a	So that , that is a whole other field of research .
34900	0	a	I do not know if it would be , if we would still have a remote , or if you are talking to your television and saying change channel .
34901	0	a	and depending on how many members you have in households .
34902	0	a	Yeah .
34903	0	a	So it m it may be too complicated for us , but it is something to keep in mind anyway .
34904	0	a	Yeah .
34905	0	a	And something that might further complicate it is that the TV makes noise itself .
34906	0	a	Right .
34907	0	a	Wonder if it would have
34908	0	a	Yeah .
34909	0	a	Yeah .
34910	0	a	And if there was conversation in the room at the same time , although in theory it does not tend to be when you are watching television , but could be very difficult to get the specific design .
34911	0	a	Yeah .
34912	0	a	If we are looking for a simplistic design ,
34913	0	a	if
34914	1	a	We need to decide if that is our intention is , is a simplistic design .
34915	0	a	Yeah .
34916	0	a	, because if , if it is then I think voice , voice activated
34917	0	a	Yeah ,
34918	0	a	and that would sort of negate the whole remote control thing , because if people can activate the television with their voice then they wo not be using a , they wo not be talking into a remote , I am sure .
34919	0	a	It looks like
34920	0	a	It would be like the ultimate remote .
34921	0	a	okay .
34922	0	a	And th the last thing here was a , an LCD screen .
34923	0	a	So , I mean voice recognition might be a little too extreme for us .
34924	0	a	Not practical .
34925	0	a	an LCD screen though might be something that , you know , you can shift through pages kind of li the way this PowerPoint is working .
34926	0	a	Yeah .
34927	0	a	So that you do not have so many buttons to deal with .
34928	0	a	, I do not know what an LCD screen is .
34929	0	a	Oh sorry ,
34930	0	a	just , just a screen , like a computer screen .
34931	0	a	S Or like
34932	0	a	Yeah .
34933	0	a	Mobile phone .
34934	0	a	Yeah .
34935	0	a	Or Like an alarm clock .
34936	0	a	You would have an LCD versus just a , a normal clock .
34937	0	a	What , what would appear on the screen ?
34938	1	a	Like linked in with the teletext , or sort of like an teletext at your fingers , without having to access that through the television .
34939	0	a	I have no idea still .
34940	0	a	I am sorry .
34941	0	a	Oh just like an electronic screen .
34942	0	a	As opposed to just buttons .
34943	0	a	There would be like a little , like on
34944	0	a	Yeah .
34945	0	a	Oh , on the remote .
34946	0	a	Okay .
34947	0	a	Like on the top of a cellphone , the the little LCD screen .
34948	0	a	Yeah .
34949	0	a	, now that is , I ,
34950	0	a	I dunno exactly what exactly we would put on there .
34951	0	a	I guess the channel that you are on , the v the volume setting .
34952	0	a	Yeah .
34953	0	a	Could it it
34954	1	a	It would be good if it had the actual programme that was on , and what was next .
34955	0	a	But that would probably be
34956	0	a	Yeah .
34957	0	a	That would be good , yeah .
34958	0	a	Yeah .
34959	0	a	Might be quite expensive to do that though .
34960	0	a	, Yeah .
34961	0	a	Could be .
34962	0	a	Well I guess that is something we can all take back to our respective research .
34963	0	a	Right .
34964	1	a	, and finally , whoops , my personal preferences and thoughts .
34965	1	a	, I think our priority really should be unique design .
34966	0	a	, we want something that people want in their home .
34967	0	a	Every remote control looks the same ,
34968	1	a	so in my opinion it should be , , user friendly and unique .
34969	0	a	So the other stuff might be a little too , a little too gadgety for some people .
34970	0	a	Yeah .
34971	0	a	, I th myself , voice recognition kind of scares me off .
34972	0	a	So if we are , if we are aiming to make this an international university , universally accepted product
34973	0	a	, and for all ,
34974	0	a	the other thing is like age market .
34975	1	a	I mean if we wanted to concentrate on fifteen to twenty five years olds , we could go for the fancy stuff .
34976	1	a	But if we want to make fifty million , and and have everyone want this remote control , we should maybe stick to the basics .
34977	1	a	And we should keep in mind that fifteen to twenty five year olds might not have twenty five Euros to spend on a remote control .
34978	0	a	Like their priorities might not be a fancy remote control , when they are just starting out
34979	0	a	and , yeah .
34980	0	a	Right .
34981	1	a	And we have to keep in mind the , the reliability of our research .
34982	0	a	I mean , you know , a sixteen year old boy would say ,
34983	0	a	yeah
34984	0	a	I would pay extra for voice recognition , until they realise that is three months allowance .
34985	0	a	Yeah .
34986	1	a	, so I I think , I think the older generations we should be catering to a bit more .
34987	0	a	Yeah .
34988	0	a	Early twenties , that is the kind of age group .
34989	0	a	Yeah .
34990	0	a	And if one of the largest , , or most complained about thing is that it takes so long to get to know how to use a remote control ,
34991	0	a	I am sure that something like an LCD screen or remote control would be just furthering that problem .
34992	0	a	Twenties .
34993	0	a	Yeah .
34994	0	a	Yeah .
34995	0	a	Yeah .
34996	0	a	Yep .
34997	0	a	Complicated jus complicating things even fo .
34998	0	a	Yeah .
34999	0	a	Yeah .
35000	0	a	Alright .
35001	0	a	Okay .
35002	0	a	Okay .
35003	0	a	That is it for the market research .
35004	0	a	Okay .
35005	0	a	Before we go into more discussion on we want this design to look like , I have received some information from the management that will affect some of our decisions .
35006	0	a	, for one thing , because Having controls with DVD , VCR , that sort of thing , would really complicate the design of the remote control .
35007	0	a	, we have decided not to include them and make it a specific , just a specific television function .
35008	0	a	Which is good as , as we have sort of decided that we would like to go with that anyway .
35009	0	a	, for many reasons .
35010	0	a	So we have that decision sort of made for us .
35011	0	a	Another thing that might affect other decisions is that the management feels that teletext is outdated , because more people are using the internet now .
35012	0	a	And so we wo not concern ourselves with navigating the teletext option .
35013	1	a	Can I just interrupt ?
35014	1	a	Would you like to plug in your
35015	0	a	Have you got a PowerPoint or not ?
35016	0	a	Okay .
35017	0	a	Yep .
35018	0	a	Yeah .
35019	1	a	Maybe we can do the
35020	0	a	There you go .
35021	0	a	Okay , sure .
35022	0	a	Yeah I do .
35023	0	a	I am looking at looking at it right now .
35024	0	a	Thanks .
35025	0	a	thank you .
35026	0	a	Oh , come back screen .
35027	0	a	Were they , was the management suggesting use of the internet rather than teletext , or just avoiding both altogether ?
35028	0	a	Yeah .
35029	0	a	, well ,
35030	0	a	I mean we do not have the resources or or possibility of using the internet with the remote control , but they were just pretty much saying that the teletext would not be used .
35031	0	a	Yeah .
35032	0	a	Okay .
35033	0	a	Yeah .
35034	0	a	Okay .
35035	1	a	Alright , and another thing .
35036	0	a	This is for the design , the design of the product is that we want to create , more of a sense that people know that this is from our company .
35037	0	a	So , , all the remote controls must have our We will incorporate our logo and colour in in some way .
35038	0	a	Right .
35039	0	a	Yeah .
35040	0	a	Yeah .
35041	1	a	So , , perhaps our logo on the bottom , or wherever you feel like it would look good .
35042	0	a	Okay .
35043	0	a	, it does not have to be the colour of our of our company but , another thing is that , we need to , we probably would have to have that colour and , and logo decided upon .
35044	0	a	Just
35045	0	a	Okay .
35046	0	a	, I am assuming that we already have one , but for the purposes of this meeting
35047	0	a	I , I was not offered a , like a type of logo or colour ,
35048	1	a	so if that could be somewhere on the design so that we can be recognisable .
35049	1	a	Work on that .
35050	0	a	It is probably R RR in yellow .
35051	0	a	Yeah .
35052	0	a	Yeah .
35053	0	a	The little R R yellow thing ?
35054	0	a	Okay .
35055	0	a	Yeah , I think .
35056	0	a	Yeah .
35057	0	a	Real Reaction ?
35058	0	a	Okay .
35059	0	a	, yes , those are the changes .
35060	1	a	, so , now we need to discuss , and come to a decision on our remote control functions , of , of how this is going to be .
35061	1	a	I am just going to look at my notes for a second .
35062	1	a	, we have to decide on a target group and the functions of the remote control .
35063	0	a	So , , we already know that it will just be for the television .
35064	0	a	Okay .
35065	0	a	It will It wo not have teletext .
35066	1	a	But , you know , we could discuss those other options that you brought up , Genevieve .
35067	0	a	Okay ,
35068	0	a	so I
35069	0	a	Are we going to write off the LCD option ?
35070	0	a	Yeah ?
35071	0	a	Okay .
35072	0	a	Yeah .
35073	0	a	Is that how most people feel about that ?
35074	0	a	Okay .
35075	0	a	Yeah .
35076	0	a	Yeah .
35077	0	a	So no LCD , no teletext , and no voice recognition .
35078	0	a	I think it would be annoying though if
35079	0	a	I do not use teletext that much , but if it was on your TV , you would want to be able to use it ,
35080	0	a	if You would
35081	0	a	Yeah .
35082	0	a	Yeah ,
35083	0	a	but another thing is that if we are reaching an international crowd , , I know for one that in North America there is no such thing as teletext , so it would be really superfluous .
35084	0	a	Yeah .
35085	0	a	So is it just
35086	0	a	Okay .
35087	0	a	Never heard of it .
35088	0	a	Yeah .
35089	0	a	Alright .
35090	0	a	Yeah
35091	0	a	Right .
35092	0	a	I do not know about other countries besides the UK .
35093	0	a	Do you know if anywhere else has it ?
35094	0	a	Alright .
35095	0	a	I do not know .
35096	0	a	I do not know .
35097	0	a	I do not know .
35098	0	a	More research required , I think .
35099	0	a	But if
35100	0	a	Was it a management decision that we are having
35101	0	a	Okay .
35102	0	a	It was a management decision , so it is , it is pretty much out of our hands at this point .
35103	0	a	Yeah .
35104	0	a	So
35105	0	a	Okay .
35106	0	a	Okay then .
35107	0	a	Kay .
35108	0	a	So , I guess we are looking at something rather simple .
35109	1	a	, well I guess , just from my findings it looks like we want to minimise buttons .
35110	0	a	Kay .
35111	0	a	Minimal
35112	0	a	Yeah okay .
35113	0	a	And the
35114	0	a	What was the word they used ?
35115	0	a	F findability is important .
35116	0	a	Yeah .
35117	1	a	I think we should definitely go ahead with the alarm system idea that you had .
35118	0	a	Yeah .
35119	0	a	Cause I am sure that could be inex inexpensive because we could use the same kind of infrared the same signal through that and it could just like make a little beeping noise .
35120	0	a	Yeah .
35121	0	a	The same signalling .
35122	0	a	I mean
35123	0	a	Or vibrate just the same as a mobile phone .
35124	0	a	It is not that expensive to do .
35125	0	a	Like you just a , a buzz or something .
35126	0	a	Yeah .
35127	0	a	Yeah .
35128	0	a	Yeah .
35129	0	a	Okay .
35130	0	a	I like that idea .
35131	0	a	Would you be able to , , put the little device anywhere ?
35132	0	a	Cause is not our remote control for all TVs ,
35133	0	a	so you would ha
35134	0	a	Yeah , with the button that you pressed .
35135	0	a	If
35136	0	a	Do you mean the the link between the
35137	0	a	Well , if the button was actually on
35138	0	a	Oh , yeah .
35139	0	a	Yeah .
35140	0	a	The button
35141	0	a	Oh .
35142	0	a	Yeah .
35143	0	a	C cause then it would only be a applicable to one TV set , so it would need to be something that you could stick somewhere , or something .
35144	0	a	Minor detail there .
35145	0	a	Maybe
35146	0	a	Yeah ,
35147	0	a	yeah .
35148	1	a	Maybe something adhesive that you could like stick onto the back of any set that would be yeah not very obtrusive .
35149	0	a	Yeah , it would have t
35150	0	a	Yeah .
35151	0	a	Obviously something small that is
35152	0	a	Yeah , that is a good point .
35153	0	a	Yeah .
35154	0	a	Yeah .
35155	0	a	Then it would not , it probably would not be able to use
35156	0	a	It would be able to use the same reception on the remote c control I guess , but the actual device would have to have its own infrared signaller .
35157	0	a	Yeah .
35158	0	a	Yeah .
35159	0	a	Okay .
35160	0	a	Yeah , okay .
35161	0	a	Would it need a battery then ?
35162	0	a	Yeah .
35163	0	a	Maybe ,
35164	0	a	Probably ,
35165	0	a	I mean .
35166	0	a	Pr probably .
35167	0	a	Unless it could be
35168	0	a	Okay .
35169	0	a	That is your department
35170	1	a	you will have to sort that out .
35171	0	a	, unless some way , it could have some universal connection to like the socket , the same socket that the TV is supplied from .
35172	0	a	I mean the power for the TV .
35173	1	a	So , , more research into that one .
35174	0	a	Yeah , you will have to
35175	0	a	Yeah ,
35176	1	a	you will have to investi
35177	1	a	Do some research on that ,
35178	0	a	alright ?
35179	0	a	Great .
35180	0	a	Yeah .
35181	0	a	, alright ,
35182	0	a	and I am sure that , , the glow in the dark , fluorescent , whatever , system , is a go ahead .
35183	0	a	Is everyone interested in that ?
35184	0	a	Yeah .
35185	0	a	Y
35186	0	a	Yeah .
35187	0	a	On the buttons ?
35188	0	a	it does not
35189	1	a	It could it could be a tactile thing as well .
35190	0	a	I I like the light up suggestion .
35191	0	a	I think that would be better .
35192	0	a	Cause you know the way fluorescent lights lose their brightness after certain time , so
35193	0	a	I would go for
35194	1	a	Well just the numbers could be embossed ,
35195	0	a	could not it ?
35196	0	a	Like raised .
35197	0	a	Yeah .
35198	0	a	Yeah .
35199	0	a	Yeah .
35200	0	a	Yeah .
35201	1	a	right , if w if we are minimising buttons , we might be able to make them actually larger .
35202	1	a	And there is something on it .
35203	1	a	S you know like up arrow down arrow for , for volume .
35204	1	a	Like a raised
35205	0	a	Yeah
35206	0	a	That is true .
35207	0	a	, and I do not know what we could do for , for channels .
35208	0	a	S
35209	0	a	The numbers themselves .
35210	0	a	Yeah .
35211	1	a	But then the like up button and down button for the channel , channel changing .
35212	0	a	Could be raised .
35213	1	a	Just little arrows , that you could feel , maybe ?
35214	0	a	Yeah .
35215	0	a	Yeah .
35216	0	a	I just thought that it , it might be sucking more battery power , if there , if it is a light up .
35217	0	a	I am not sure .
35218	0	a	Yeah .
35219	0	a	And also y ,
35220	0	a	Heather you mentioned before , like how it should be accessible to everybody .
35221	0	a	But I mean
35222	0	a	Yeah .
35223	0	a	, so like big b buttons , for people you are visually impaired .
35224	0	a	Yeah .
35225	0	a	The glow in the dark or light up wo not make any difference anyway .
35226	0	a	So like you say tactile might be better , because it would be more available to everybody .
35227	0	a	That , I think that is good , yeah .
35228	0	a	Yeah .
35229	0	a	Could we somehow
35230	1	a	We could , may , possibly , sorry , incorporate them both so that the buttons could maybe be in the shape of the numbers themselves and be made out of some glow in the dark material .
35231	0	a	Yeah .
35232	0	a	Yeah .
35233	0	a	Yeah .
35234	0	a	Yeah .
35235	0	a	Yeah .
35236	0	a	Yeah .
35237	0	a	Cause I d
35238	0	a	I do not think that glow in the dark material , , like the actual soft plastic , , costs that much more than other colours .
35239	0	a	No , I would not say so .
35240	0	a	No , it is not these days .
35241	0	a	I mean , it is quite easily accessible .
35242	0	a	Yeah .
35243	0	a	I guess the other option , referring to the battery thing is , you know how cellphones will t light up for fifteen seconds or something , when you are s
35244	0	a	and then it goes , so
35245	0	a	if , if you are like changing the volume during a movie .
35246	0	a	Yeah .
35247	0	a	That is good
35248	0	a	Yeah
35249	0	a	that a good idea .
35250	0	a	Yeah .
35251	0	a	I know , I am thinking of mostly when you are watching a movie you turn all the lights off right .
35252	0	a	Yeah .
35253	0	a	Yeah .
35254	0	a	And you do not want to turn on the lights , to turn it down , because there is suddenly an explosion , and it is going to wake up the baby .
35255	0	a	Yeah .
35256	0	a	Yeah .
35257	0	a	, so if you touch the button , it kind of reactivates it .
35258	0	a	It lights up for On self timer .
35259	0	a	That , yeah , that is a good idea .
35260	0	a	Yeah .
35261	0	a	Yeah .
35262	0	a	So self timed lighting .
35263	0	a	Yeah .
35264	0	a	Alright we have five minutes left , for the meeting ,
35265	1	a	but I think we should discuss this light subject a little bit more before we close .
35266	0	a	, I
35267	0	a	Yeah .
35268	0	a	, what was
35269	0	a	I missed the last moment , reading that .
35270	0	a	What were you talking about with the lighting up buttons ?
35271	0	a	Yeah .
35272	0	a	Oh , just if it was kind of the same way that a cell
35273	0	a	You know how a cellphone will light up for about ten , fifteen seconds when you touch a button , after having not touched it for a while .
35274	0	a	Yeah .
35275	0	a	, if instead of a constant light up on the , on the remote control , if it lights up for ten seconds when it is touched again .
35276	0	a	So it could be any button that would be pressed .
35277	0	a	Yeah , and you , you touch it and it just kind of lights up a bit , and it gives a faint glow .
35278	0	a	So , self timed
35279	0	a	Yeah .
35280	0	a	So if you have all the lights off in your living room , you will , you will temporarily see it .
35281	0	a	Yeah .
35282	0	a	Because usually you are not fooling around for it for more than what ten seconds .
35283	0	a	Yeah .
35284	0	a	Okay , so
35285	0	a	That is probably feasible .
35286	0	a	So
35287	0	a	Yeah .
35288	0	a	So , do you think that we should do the lighting up thing , and the glow in the dark thing , and the shape of the numbers ?
35289	0	a	Do we have to kind of decide what we are going to do with this .
35290	0	a	I think the shape of the numbers is a really good idea .
35291	0	a	Yeah .
35292	0	a	Yeah , okay .
35293	0	a	And I think that is un unique as well .
35294	0	a	For visually impaired , yeah .
35295	0	a	I mean , I have not seen that .
35296	0	a	Yeah .
35297	0	a	And as you are saying like numbers can wear off if they are just sort of like painted on , you know printed .
35298	0	a	Yeah ,
35299	0	a	yeah .
35300	0	a	And it could , if it is that softer rubber material it will be , maybe , , , better for people with els no
35301	0	a	what is it called , RSI , what was it that we were talking about ?
35302	0	a	Yeah .
35303	0	a	durable .
35304	0	a	Oh yeah .
35305	0	a	Yeah .
35306	0	a	Oh right ,
35307	0	a	the
35308	0	a	Yeah .
35309	0	a	Yeah .
35310	0	a	Repetitive strain injury .
35311	0	a	Yeah instead of like hard buttons .
35312	0	a	Okay .
35313	0	a	, did we want to go for the glow in the dark look ?
35314	0	a	Or did we want to go for the lighting up instantly ?
35315	0	a	Like should we do both ?
35316	0	a	Or we can have one or the other ?
35317	0	a	Because it might , for , for our design purposes , I mean , the lighting up thing might be better because glow in the dark material has a funny kind of colour .
35318	0	a	If
35319	1	a	I was thinking though , if it was glow in the dark , you could put the Real Reaction symbol as glow in the dark , and then it would be constantly advertised .
35320	0	a	I was going to say ,
35321	0	a	Exactly .
35322	0	a	And it might not go with different like face plates that we might come up with .
35323	0	a	Yeah .
35324	0	a	It the
35325	0	a	it might be perceived as tacky , glow in the dark .
35326	0	a	It is kind of like Eighties neon style .
35327	0	a	Yeah .
35328	0	a	Yeah ,
35329	0	a	and we could
35330	0	a	Yeah there are now like loads , or a huge range of different colours that it could light up in as well ,
35331	1	a	which could like link in with the company colours .
35332	0	a	, whereas we are trying to be trendy and fashionable .
35333	0	a	So
35334	1	a	Like it could be blue or green or yellow ,
35335	0	a	or like we have just limited t with the , just ordinary phosphorescent so
35336	0	a	Yeah .
35337	0	a	Right .
35338	0	a	Right .
35339	0	a	Alright .
35340	0	a	So we have decided on lighting up things .
35341	1	a	Every time the , that it lit up , you c that could light up as well .
35342	0	a	Yeah .
35343	0	a	Yeah .
35344	0	a	Or , or the , whate
35345	0	a	Yeah .
35346	0	a	Yeah .
35347	0	a	Yeah .
35348	1	a	But with the same thing , I mean .
35349	0	a	That is true .
35350	1	a	If you touch the button and then it could be , it could be lit up as well .
35351	0	a	Yeah .
35352	0	a	Okay .
35353	0	a	Is
35354	0	a	Are you okay with that ?
35355	0	a	Okay .
35356	0	a	Yeah .
35357	0	a	Cool .
35358	0	a	Alright .
35359	0	a	So I think that that completes most of our our more practical decisions .
35360	0	a	Is
35361	0	a	Okay .
35362	0	a	And now it is up to designing .
35363	0	a	And making sure that this can be feasible .
35364	0	a	What
35365	0	a	Oh sorry .
35366	0	a	And do you have anything
35367	1	a	Do you have anything to say ?
35368	0	a	Like an iPod or something ?
35369	0	a	Okay .
35370	1	a	Yeah well , I was just going to throw out there the thought about personalising the remote control .
35371	0	a	, it , you , cause you mentioned face plates .
35372	1	a	So I I dunno if there is something that diff , you know like five different face plates .
35373	0	a	I dunno if this will start making it more complicated , but it could increase the popularity of the , of the remote .
35374	0	a	Oh yeah .
35375	0	a	Like you can have changeable mobile covers or something .
35376	0	a	Yeah ,
35377	0	a	Exactly , like an iPod .
35378	0	a	Interchangeable thing ?
35379	0	a	That would be good .
35380	0	a	Yeah , or
35381	0	a	Okay .
35382	0	a	Yeah .
35383	0	a	Exactly .
35384	0	a	Or , or like mobile ph .
35385	0	a	Like a cellphone ?
35386	0	a	Yeah .
35387	1	a	And I dunno if we would want to go with like TV show themes or something .
35388	1	a	Like a Bart Simpson faceplate .
35389	0	a	Yeah , and then that would be more profitable like as a sideline to the remote as well .
35390	0	a	But
35391	0	a	Yeah .
35392	1	a	Y Could buy extra
35393	0	a	Yeah .
35394	0	a	Accessories .
35395	0	a	Exactly .
35396	1	a	You could start out with three , and if , if we hit it big then we can add some on .
35397	0	a	Person
35398	0	a	Yeah .
35399	0	a	Well , that is great .
35400	0	a	That is a good idea .
35401	0	a	Yeah .
35402	0	a	Yeah .
35403	1	a	I think that we should incorporate that .
35404	0	a	Interchangeable .
35405	0	a	, als
35406	0	a	Yeah .
35407	0	a	Cause that would not be very expensive at all .
35408	0	a	You would just get one mould , throw some plastic in it , you know .
35409	0	a	No .
35410	0	a	Interchan
35411	0	a	And also possible
35412	0	a	I mean , , we could gain out of that by advertising certain TV shows , or
35413	0	a	Yeah .
35414	0	a	Oh yeah .
35415	0	a	Yeah .
35416	0	a	Well , that might be com problematic with copyright issues .
35417	0	a	Right .
35418	1	a	So , if it takes off then we will , we will , we will try that out .
35419	0	a	But if we , there is
35420	0	a	Yeah .
35421	0	a	If w
35422	0	a	No .
35423	0	a	We could
35424	0	a	, the environmental factor , we did not bring that up again .
35425	0	a	Right .
35426	1	a	We will have to do more research .
35427	0	a	Like as of yet , that has nothing to do with , , the way it will look .
35428	0	a	Yeah .
35429	0	a	, does it need to be reached a de
35430	0	a	Do we need to reach a decision on that right now ?
35431	0	a	Because we need to investigate the financial implications .
35432	0	a	, I have
35433	0	a	Okay .
35434	0	a	Okay .
35435	0	a	Let is
35436	0	a	I think we could probably leave that until later on , then .
35437	0	a	Is it
35438	0	a	Does it need to be decided on now ?
35439	0	a	Or should we
35440	0	a	Okay .
35441	0	a	Good .
35442	0	a	Alright then .
35443	1	a	Anyone else have anything more to say before we close ?
35444	0	a	Alright , well .
35445	0	a	No .
35446	1	a	Let is have lunch
35447	1	a	and we will discuss this later .
35448	0	a	Okay .
35449	0	a	 
35450	0	a	Is everyone ready to start ?
35451	0	a	Okay .
35452	0	a	Yeah .
35453	0	a	Yeah .
35454	0	a	Yes .
35455	0	a	Great .
35456	0	a	Well , welcome to the third meeting of conceptual design .
35457	1	a	I will just get the PowerPoint presentation up and running .
35458	0	a	Okay .
35459	0	a	on the agenda for this , , for this particular meeting , we will have your three presentations on what you have done since our last meeting , after we came up with some general ideas of our design .
35460	0	a	And , , then we have to make some key decisions on , on our remote control concept , and how we are going to make it , what materials we are going to use , and that sort of thing .
35461	0	a	The meeting will be forty minutes long .
35462	0	a	Okay .
35463	0	a	And we will once again have Poppy as our first presenter .
35464	0	a	Okay .
35465	1	a	Alright , and I will switch up PowerPoint .
35466	0	a	Thank you .
35467	0	a	Okay .
35468	0	a	Should be just loading .
35469	0	a	Okay .
35470	0	a	Oh ,
35471	0	a	although I ca not see it on my screen .
35472	0	a	That says go here .
35473	0	a	Okay .
35474	0	a	I have been doing some research into the different components that we could use , what is available to us f to actually make the remote control .
35475	0	a	, first of all we have to look at how the remote control is actually made , and what is it happens inside the casing , which is more your field .
35476	0	a	, thes main internal feature is a circuit board , which contains all the elec electronics and also the contacts with the power source .
35477	0	a	Which is not necessarily a battery , as we are about to see .
35478	0	a	, there are several components of , , the circuit board that we need to consider , where we will be getting them from , what they will be made of .
35479	0	a	, including the integrated circuit , which is also known as the chip .
35480	0	a	Which is where all the main information is contained .
35481	0	a	, diodes , transistors , resonators , resistors , and capacit capacitors all need to be considered as well .
35482	0	a	, and all their positioning in the circuit .
35483	0	a	Are they all included , like mandatorily , or r are these different options ?
35484	0	a	Yeah .
35485	0	a	, these ,
35486	0	a	they are all different options , they are all separate , apart from the chip , which we will probable decide whether we buy a simple , a regular , advanced .
35487	0	a	We can go into that later .
35488	0	a	, all the other things are individual components that we would have to get in separately , and work out the most , like , effective circuit , including all the wires and everything like that .
35489	0	a	And the LED of course , that is a light emitting diode .
35490	0	a	So , we could ,
35491	0	a	so we have got flex flexibility with colours and things , with that as well .
35492	0	a	Okay , there are lots of different possibilities for the energy source .
35493	0	a	We could use a basic battery , but that brings with it , like they need to be recharged and the bulk , the size of it as well .
35494	0	a	And they are not so great to dispose of , environmentally .
35495	0	a	There is a hand powered dynamo which is a sort of thing that was used for torches fifty years ago .
35496	0	a	A bit out of date .
35497	0	a	Kinetic energy is something that is been recently developed .
35498	0	a	What is a hand powered dynamo ?
35499	0	a	Just every , every once in a while ?
35500	0	a	Just every once in a while or constantly ?
35501	0	a	Alright .
35502	0	a	, where you manually charge up the power .
35503	0	a	Like you wind up something .
35504	0	a	Sorry ?
35505	0	a	Yeah .
35506	0	a	Every once in a while I think
35507	0	a	But it is
35508	0	a	Yeah .
35509	0	a	It would be kind of strange to always be cranking it I think .
35510	0	a	It would be like going a step back in time .
35511	0	a	Yeah .
35512	0	a	I do not think it would really be with kind of cutting edge technology .
35513	0	a	No .
35514	0	a	Whereas kinetic energy is a new idea that is being used by some watches and other devices , where you just shake the device and it gives it power .
35515	0	a	I mean , the kinetic energy is transformed into power to make the circuit work .
35516	0	a	, or there is solar power ,
35517	0	a	which we have been considering inside a building , which is where it is going to be used , might not be quite so useful .
35518	0	a	Right .
35519	0	a	But , good to look into , renewable energy , always the way .
35520	0	a	, lots of considerations for the case , like what sort of shape it would be , curved or flat .
35521	0	a	That is got a lot to do with the ergonomics .
35522	0	a	Like how it is comfortable and s sits in the hand .
35523	0	a	We do not want something that is huge and you ca not pick up .
35524	0	a	Or too small .
35525	0	a	Or too slidy .
35526	0	a	I know I have had a remote control before which you could not tell which was the front and the back , cause it had so many buttons on , and the shape was so symmetrical that I would be pressing like a volume button instead of the on button .
35527	0	a	Because you ca not really see which way round it is .
35528	0	a	Right .
35529	0	a	, we also can choose what materials
35530	0	a	, the
35531	0	a	we could use metal , we could use rubber
35532	0	a	which might be more ideal for the anti RSI .
35533	0	a	It is like the same sort of rubber that is used in stress balls and things like that , so it is very like soft , not so stressful on your hands .
35534	0	a	Wood .
35535	0	a	, again , stepping back in time again there .
35536	0	a	I do not think that is quite up to date with what we are looking for here .
35537	0	a	Yeah .
35538	0	a	, titanium is not going to be possible , even though it just it beyond our budget really .
35539	0	a	But , would have been maybe for future projects .
35540	0	a	right our choice for buttons as well .
35541	0	a	We have developed some
35542	0	a	we have got some good advances in technology , with our research team have found some new multiple option scroll buttons .
35543	0	a	I think that was brought up for , ,
35544	0	a	they are basically quite a flexible design , modern , you do not have to use individual buttons .
35545	0	a	You can just slide up and down .
35546	0	a	I am sure we are all quite familiar with those on mobiles or computer laptop pads .
35547	0	a	Yeah .
35548	0	a	one thing with the scroll buttons though .
35549	0	a	It , it
35550	0	a	we would have to have an LCD display , and the glow in the dark thing might be difficult .
35551	0	a	Yeah .
35552	0	a	That is true .
35553	0	a	And that would lead to an advanced
35554	0	a	yeah .
35555	0	a	If we have
35556	0	a	yeah .
35557	0	a	We are going on to that later with the advanc with the LCD that means we would need a really advanced chip .
35558	0	a	Yeah .
35559	0	a	And it is unlikely that that is going to be in our budget .
35560	0	a	, also we have got the integrated pushbutton , which is what we are most familiar with .
35561	0	a	It is the most straightforward .
35562	0	a	But you can in like incorporate that with a scroll button as well .
35563	0	a	Got decisions to make there .
35564	0	a	And this is what I was just saying before .
35565	0	a	Linked in the different depends on what type of buttons we have and the inputs .
35566	0	a	simple would go with the pushbutton .
35567	0	a	, regular you could link with the scroll button .
35568	0	a	And the advanced we would have to go with a LCD s display .
35569	0	a	Right .
35570	0	a	My personal preferences ?
35571	1	a	I think we could go for the kinetic energy source .
35572	0	a	I do not ,
35573	0	a	I think that is quite an advanced kind of technology .
35574	0	a	It is not been seen before , so it could be quite a , a novelty factor , attractive as well .
35575	0	a	And also energy saving cause you are producing the energy , you do not need an external sort of battery supply or solar panels .
35576	0	a	You just give it a shake .
35577	0	a	Yeah .
35578	0	a	Sounds brilliant to me .
35579	1	a	Rubber casing I thing would probably the best , if we are going for the anti RSI and like more choice with aesthetics .
35580	0	a	Like it could be pretty much any colour we want .
35581	0	a	, and gives you , yeah , more flexibility there .
35582	1	a	And probably the regular chip as opposed to the simple , then we could possibly have the scroll and the push , but no LCD , cause we probably ca not afford that one .
35583	0	a	Yeah .
35584	0	a	, one concern with the rubber casing is that it would be rubber encapsulating all of these chips and diodes and delicate technology as
35585	0	a	like as the exterior .
35586	0	a	This is the one thing that is protecting its innards .
35587	0	a	I think that would , there would be an in sort of more internal casing .
35588	0	a	And the rubber would just be the , what is in contact with the human .
35589	0	a	Yeah .
35590	0	a	Yeah .
35591	0	a	Another thing is it might be more difficult if it is a rubber exterior talking about putting on interchangeable plates .
35592	0	a	Yeah .
35593	0	a	, is it
35594	0	a	I do not see how a like a rubber plate going on top it would stay there .
35595	0	a	Like if it was sort of like a clip on plastic plate .
35596	0	a	It would work that way .
35597	1	a	Maybe if the , , if it was just kind of a , more of a rubber coating which was on to a case .
35598	0	a	W
35599	0	a	Like plastic with rubber , kind of on top
35600	0	a	Well , there is , there is a certain phone that has like a rubber casing , b like a Nokia it is .
35601	1	a	So , it was kind of , the whole thing would be removable .
35602	0	a	Yeah .
35603	0	a	Like
35604	0	a	I ca not think of what .
35605	0	a	Yeah .
35606	0	a	Yeah .
35607	0	a	Yeah .
35608	0	a	Or like an
35609	0	a	you can get sort of outer casing for iPods and something , that is just it is protective as well .
35610	0	a	It is
35611	0	a	yeah .
35612	0	a	Yeah .
35613	0	a	Like the skin ?
35614	0	a	Yeah .
35615	0	a	It , it stops it , I mean ,
35616	0	a	it would reduce the impact if it was dropped or something , as well , cause it would not damage itself so easily .
35617	0	a	Yeah .
35618	0	a	Alright .
35619	1	a	I think i maybe a mixture of both there , maybe .
35620	0	a	So maybe the
35621	0	a	Yeah .
35622	0	a	Okay .
35623	0	a	Yeah .
35624	0	a	So the actual remote would be hard plastic and the casings rubber .
35625	0	a	And then
35626	0	a	yeah .
35627	0	a	Yeah .
35628	0	a	Yeah .
35629	0	a	Okay .
35630	0	a	And the buttons obviously are rubber .
35631	0	a	Yeah .
35632	0	a	Yeah .
35633	0	a	Yeah .
35634	0	a	Okay .
35635	0	a	Yeah .
35636	0	a	That sounds good .
35637	0	a	I , ,
35638	0	a	is it possible to put designs onto this type of rubber ?
35639	0	a	Okay , we will just say yeah .
35640	0	a	As far as I know .
35641	0	a	It should be .
35642	0	a	Yeah .
35643	0	a	Yes , just why not .
35644	0	a	Yeah ,
35645	0	a	yeah .
35646	0	a	Alright .
35647	0	a	I like the kinetic energy source idea .
35648	0	a	Yeah .
35649	0	a	I thought that was
35650	0	a	Yeah .
35651	0	a	, I do not know when people will , , be moving a remote around a lot .
35652	0	a	Yeah , tha
35653	0	a	Backup .
35654	0	a	But I think that it is worth it , kinetety , kinetic energy source .
35655	0	a	It could make an we could have any kind of style .
35656	0	a	It would not be as heavy or bulky ,
35657	0	a	and
35658	0	a	Yeah .
35659	0	a	Yeah .
35660	0	a	Just for environmental reasons .
35661	0	a	Yeah .
35662	0	a	I guess it is a bit scary cause it has not been done before .
35663	0	a	Yeah .
35664	1	a	So it seems we would have to do more research on it .
35665	0	a	Or I dunno if you could have a battery pack .
35666	0	a	Yeah .
35667	0	a	Like as a backup for something .
35668	0	a	Yeah so there is there is a one battery , because most remotes use two batteries I believe .
35669	0	a	Yeah .
35670	0	a	Yeah .
35671	0	a	Yeah .
35672	0	a	So , if it was running off of one battery as a
35673	0	a	Right .
35674	0	a	That would be good
35675	0	a	yeah .
35676	0	a	Yeah .
35677	0	a	Some alternative just in case something went wrong .
35678	0	a	Maybe we could
35679	0	a	you were saying about solar power ma maybe not working indoors , but a lot of calculators , yeah , have solar power .
35680	0	a	That is true .
35681	0	a	I just thought of that .
35682	0	a	Yeah .
35683	1	a	So maybe that could be incorporated as
35684	0	a	Yeah .
35685	0	a	Yeah .
35686	1	a	May maybe that could be the backup .
35687	0	a	Instead of a battery .
35688	0	a	Yeah .
35689	0	a	Although it needs some light ,
35690	0	a	does not it ?
35691	0	a	So , if we are doing
35692	0	a	yeah .
35693	0	a	Like solar backup .
35694	0	a	Yeah .
35695	0	a	Do , do those calculators
35696	0	a	yeah .
35697	0	a	I suppose
35698	0	a	s but some
35699	0	a	But thing is , it is not you do not need the solar all the time .
35700	0	a	Yeah , you can watch a TV in the dark then .
35701	0	a	If we are
35702	0	a	Yeah .
35703	0	a	I do not know how it works .
35704	0	a	It can be stored .
35705	0	a	It can be like
35706	0	a	you can have the solar energy and then it can store that energy and use it .
35707	0	a	Yeah .
35708	0	a	It just needs to be in light for a certain amount of time per day .
35709	0	a	Yeah .
35710	0	a	Like a few hours a day .
35711	0	a	Yeah .
35712	0	a	I think that might be a little impractical though .
35713	0	a	Yeah .
35714	0	a	I think sometimes it is just shoved under , under a cushion ,
35715	0	a	and yeah .
35716	0	a	Yeah .
35717	0	a	That is true .
35718	0	a	It could easily
35719	0	a	Yeah .
35720	0	a	Yeah .
35721	0	a	Like people do not want to have to worry about that .
35722	0	a	Yeah .
35723	0	a	Yeah .
35724	0	a	I suppose it would be really annoying if you get to think ,
35725	0	a	oh no ,
35726	0	a	I forgot to charge my remote today .
35727	0	a	Like if the kinetic thing , I think what is best about that is that it is instant energy .
35728	0	a	Yeah .
35729	0	a	Yeah .
35730	0	a	Yeah .
35731	0	a	You do not have to ,
35732	0	a	you know , you can shake it a few times , or whatever .
35733	0	a	Yeah .
35734	0	a	And it works .
35735	0	a	Or just like pick it up when you are going to use it .
35736	0	a	Yeah .
35737	0	a	Yeah , I suppose .
35738	0	a	Instead of you do not have to like make sure it is in the right place to charge and .
35739	0	a	Yeah .
35740	0	a	Yeah .
35741	0	a	Alright .
35742	0	a	Cool .
35743	0	a	K okay .
35744	0	a	Is that the end of your presentation .
35745	0	a	Yeah .
35746	0	a	Yeah .
35747	0	a	Alright .
35748	0	a	Thank you .
35749	0	a	There we go .
35750	0	a	Thanks .
35751	0	a	Oh .
35752	0	a	It is not on my screen .
35753	0	a	Why ?
35754	0	a	You do not know why ?
35755	0	a	Oh okay .
35756	0	a	it was not on mine either .
35757	0	a	I do not know why .
35758	0	a	I think , I just , I just used the mouse on there .
35759	0	a	Is it that one ?
35760	1	a	, I am just going to go through the interface concept with yous now .
35761	0	a	Yeah .
35762	0	a	That is
35763	0	a	Oh .
35764	0	a	Yeah .
35765	1	a	, first of all I will explain what a user interface is .
35766	0	a	It is the aspects of a computer system which can be seen or otherwise perceived , for example , heard or felt maybe , or by the human user .
35767	0	a	And it is also the commands that the user uses to control its operation and to input data .
35768	0	a	, there are two types of user interfaces .
35769	0	a	There is the graphical user interface , which emphasises the use of pictures for output and a pointing device , for example a mouse for input control .
35770	0	a	So that is sort of like the scroll thing we were talking about .
35771	0	a	Okay .
35772	0	a	Yeah .
35773	0	a	Yeah .
35774	0	a	I am not really sure about the pictures that maybe that is on an LCD screen .
35775	0	a	Or maybe it is the the buttons or pictures or something .
35776	0	a	Yeah .
35777	0	a	Yeah .
35778	0	a	Do you think it is
35779	0	a	Yeah .
35780	0	a	So I suppose sometime
35781	1	a	after you .
35782	0	a	Yeah , cause
35783	0	a	I am sorry ?
35784	0	a	, because command interface requires you to type textual commands and input at a keyboard , so the numbers are sort of like a keyboard .
35785	0	a	You are pressing the numbers for , , for what you want .
35786	0	a	Yeah .
35787	0	a	So you must , for the graphical user you must need some kind of presentation for the graphics .
35788	0	a	Like an LCD screen .
35789	0	a	I s
35790	0	a	I suppose where on some buttons you would have like the power would be s some kind of symbol .
35791	0	a	Yeah .
35792	0	a	And if you wanted to go onto teletext or , I know we are not having that , but I mean a similar thing , you , they have there is a like little picture with a screen with lines across it , which I suppose it is that sort of thing like the , the symbol on the button .
35793	0	a	Yeah .
35794	0	a	Yeah .
35795	0	a	Yeah .
35796	0	a	But if we are having a simplified display anyway , w that , we probably wo not have to focus so much on that .
35797	0	a	Yeah ,
35798	0	a	we will be doing
35799	0	a	Yeah .
35800	0	a	It will be more the on the numbers and the volume .
35801	0	a	Yeah .
35802	0	a	It would be more a command interface ,
35803	0	a	and then
35804	0	a	Yeah .
35805	0	a	Yeah .
35806	1	a	I suppose we need to think of symbols for like the volume , display , and stuff like that .
35807	0	a	So it is just draf graphical for the pointing aspect ?
35808	0	a	The infrared is like , that is considered a
35809	0	a	Okay .
35810	0	a	I For inp
35811	0	a	Yeah .
35812	0	a	No I think it is to do with the actual symbols that are on the , that is on the buttons of the remote control ,
35813	0	a	and per
35814	0	a	Well it could be a wee scroller thing , and something could come up on the screen .
35815	0	a	So when it says pointing device that does not include
35816	0	a	Okay .
35817	0	a	I think they are talking about LCD type things .
35818	0	a	Yeah .
35819	0	a	Okay .
35820	0	a	Yeah .
35821	0	a	But
35822	1	a	I think we are going to go with the command interface anyway ,
35823	0	a	to make it more simplistic .
35824	0	a	Yeah .
35825	1	a	But the , we could incorporate some of the graphical user points ,
35826	0	a	as in
35827	0	a	just to make it m nicer to look at maybe .
35828	0	a	What do you mean ?
35829	0	a	Oh yeah ,
35830	0	a	like how the buttons
35831	0	a	Yeah , as a button though .
35832	0	a	Like
35833	0	a	I ca not think of an example ,
35834	0	a	but
35835	0	a	Sort of like little pictures rather than Like a little sound .
35836	0	a	Instead of saying volume , like a little speaker or something .
35837	0	a	Yeah ,
35838	0	a	something
35839	0	a	y
35840	0	a	Yeah m perha yeah .
35841	0	a	So , it is a keyboard in the shape of it ,
35842	0	a	right ?
35843	0	a	Okay .
35844	0	a	Yeah .
35845	0	a	Maybe .
35846	0	a	Yeah .
35847	0	a	I like that idea .
35848	0	a	, the co
35849	0	a	we have decided that the command interface would be the most useful for a remote control .
35850	0	a	As it would be less complicated , and the controls would be more user friendly .
35851	0	a	, the remote control would be cheaper to design , so that we would have more money in the budget to , , target the design area of the interface .
35852	0	a	You know , make it more trendy and original .
35853	0	a	We will have more money if we keep it simple .
35854	0	a	Yeah .
35855	0	a	I am sure i like kinetic energy would probably dip into the budget .
35856	0	a	Yeah .
35857	0	a	Yeah .
35858	0	a	A bit more too ,
35859	0	a	yeah .
35860	0	a	Seeing as it is quite a new technology .
35861	0	a	We , we also have to keep in mind when we are designing our , , more user friendly remote control , that a lot of interfaces consist of a clutter of buttons ,
35862	0	a	that , ,
35863	0	a	that their functions , colours and forms are not always helpful .
35864	0	a	Yeah .
35865	0	a	That is true .
35866	0	a	Yeah .
35867	0	a	That is in like the buttons with all the different like colours for different choices and things .
35868	0	a	Yeah .
35869	0	a	It can be a bit , yeah , overwhelming .
35870	0	a	And that all interfaces are different .
35871	0	a	So , ,
35872	0	a	that does not improve the use of the produ product ,
35873	1	a	so we need to come up with something that is easy to understand .
35874	1	a	And maybe learn from the mistakes of other interfaces that can be too complicated for people to use .
35875	0	a	Yep .
35876	0	a	Does anyone have any questions ?
35877	0	a	Do you think that we should keep all the buttons to one same colour , just to keep it , give it a simplistic look .
35878	0	a	I think if we go with the design plate thing , we will have to .
35879	0	a	Just because of colour clashing , and if we wanted to ,
35880	0	a	so and ,
35881	1	a	and we might , I mean , depending on what comes out of the design , we might have to stick to just black buttons .
35882	0	a	Yeah .
35883	0	a	Yeah .
35884	0	a	But
35885	0	a	Yeah .
35886	0	a	But what about the lighting up effect ?
35887	0	a	, well , , I thought we had decided that we would if you touched one of the buttons they would all light up .
35888	0	a	You mean different colours for the lighting or
35889	0	a	And so if they were black , it would not be possible for them to light up .
35890	0	a	Oh I see what you are saying .
35891	0	a	Well y
35892	0	a	Oh so you are picturing the light is coming from the back .
35893	0	a	If they were white they would glow , probably .
35894	0	a	If they were made out of rubber .
35895	0	a	I kind of pictured it as kind of coming from the sides and lighting it up frontwards .
35896	0	a	Oh .
35897	0	a	But , but I guess , you mean from the back .
35898	0	a	Oh .
35899	0	a	Where would the light come from ?
35900	0	a	Yeah .
35901	0	a	Okay .
35902	0	a	I would assume , like , an internal light , that comes through .
35903	0	a	Okay .
35904	0	a	So there would have to , have to be some parts maybe transparent around the buttons , or something .
35905	0	a	Right .
35906	0	a	Yeah ,
35907	0	a	and well rubber is a more translucent product too , so we have that taken care of .
35908	0	a	Yeah ,
35909	0	a	yeah .
35910	0	a	It should be able to
35911	0	a	In the phone that I was thinking of as well , when you change the covers of it , the , the little buttons that actually , you know , that contro control stuff , are behind the rubber .
35912	0	a	Li
35913	0	a	yeah .
35914	0	a	So you can change the buttons when you are changing the faces .
35915	0	a	Do you know what I mean ?
35916	0	a	Cause it is just the wee control ,
35917	0	a	yeah ,
35918	0	a	thing that is behind it .
35919	0	a	Oh .
35920	0	a	Yeah .
35921	0	a	Oh .
35922	0	a	They , they insert over .
35923	0	a	Okay .
35924	0	a	So
35925	0	a	I mean , we do not have to decide on one colour .
35926	1	a	Each face could have its own colour of buttons maybe ?
35927	0	a	Yeah .
35928	0	a	Well , if they are raised up buttons .
35929	0	a	So that you can feel them .
35930	0	a	We were talking about it being more , a lot more tangible .
35931	0	a	T
35932	0	a	Okay is that my turn then ?
35933	0	a	Alright .
35934	0	a	, it might be more difficult to do .
35935	0	a	Yeah .
35936	0	a	If they are , if they are sticking up .
35937	0	a	If it is flat then , like o like on a cellphone or a mobile phone , it is like all very flat , and you just have to sort of press down on these tiny little buttons , but
35938	0	a	Yeah .
35939	0	a	Yeah .
35940	0	a	I think it would be possible .
35941	0	a	I do not think it would make that much difference .
35942	0	a	I mean , the the dimensions of it .
35943	0	a	Cause if it is just like constructed in the same way as like the front cover of a mobile phone .
35944	0	a	You can like take off the hard cover and then there is the like say the buttons .
35945	0	a	And then you get to the circuit .
35946	0	a	I do not think it would matter that the buttons were bigger through the , the top casing .
35947	0	a	I am sure you could f work it out to fit in the casing , without causing too much difficulty .
35948	0	a	Yeah .
35949	0	a	I am sure that would be fine .
35950	0	a	Okay .
35951	0	a	Yeah .
35952	0	a	Alright .
35953	0	a	If it is do able we can do .
35954	0	a	Yeah , sounds good to me .
35955	0	a	So that is everything , then ?
35956	0	a	Yeah .
35957	0	a	Okay .
35958	0	a	Alright ,
35959	0	a	thank you .
35960	0	a	That means you are up .
35961	0	a	Yeah .
35962	0	a	I have a shorter report for you today .
35963	0	a	, it took a while to get this ,
35964	0	a	You are not plugged in yet .
35965	0	a	Oh .
35966	0	a	That is a very good point .
35967	0	a	Okay , so ,
35968	0	a	this report is about trend watching .
35969	0	a	, basically so we can live up to our , our purpose of having a very fashionable remote control .
35970	0	a	Sorry .
35971	0	a	There we go .
35972	0	a	So ,
35973	0	a	just so you know , my method was mainly web web based research this time around .
35974	0	a	I also spoke with fashion experts in Milan , New York and Paris .
35975	0	a	And I looked at the design reports from previous years , here at Real Remote .
35976	0	a	, just so c we can work off of them , see how fashions have changed .
35977	1	a	, so I will list the three most important aspects that I have come across .
35978	0	a	, and they , they are each more important than the one that comes after it .
35979	0	a	, the first one is that there should be a fancy look and feel , instead of the current functional look and feel .
35980	0	a	, this should be our priority , as we have been saying .
35981	0	a	The second most important aspect is that a remote sh that the remote control should be technologically innovative .
35982	0	a	So , I think we have done a lot of talking about that , just with lighting and the buttons and the face plates .
35983	0	a	, so it looks like we will be able to keep on track with that .
35984	0	a	And the third most important aspect is that the remote control should be easy to use .
35985	0	a	So , pretty basic there .
35986	0	a	And the recent fashion update , , according to fashion watchers in Paris and Milan , is that fruit and vegetables will be the most important theme for clothes , shoes and furniture .
35987	0	a	, also , in contra in contrast to last year , the feel of the material is expected to be spongy .
35988	0	a	Again , we have already discussed that with rubber versus hard plastic buttons .
35989	0	a	So , my personal preferences here , of course , as we , we have already talked about the personal face plates in this meeting ,
35990	1	a	and I would like to stick to that .
35991	0	a	The fruits and vegetable themes , I do not know if that is going to work for us .
35992	0	a	It sounds something that you would use on kitchenware .
35993	0	a	I do not know if we want to do it on remotes .
35994	0	a	It could be one of the options .
35995	1	a	Maybe for the television that people have in their kitchen .
35996	0	a	, the temporary light up idea , sounds like we are going to stick to that .
35997	0	a	And then , , tying in a trendy look with user friendliness .
35998	0	a	Yeah .
35999	0	a	Yeah , it is the fruits and vegetables is the only area that I find rather jarring .
36000	0	a	Everything else we can really , we can really , do , according to our plans already , given the market .
36001	0	a	It is strange .
36002	0	a	But fruits and vegetables seems a very strange idea for a remote control .
36003	0	a	It is , it is a little but it , it is everywhere .
36004	0	a	Yeah .
36005	0	a	Well We
36006	0	a	I think we possibly could take a more abstract design .
36007	0	a	So maybe we
36008	0	a	I have seen a lot of purses with olives on them , you know .
36009	0	a	Yeah .
36010	1	a	But I I think , I think if we stick to TV based , you know , maybe TV shows , or Or colour schemes .
36011	0	a	Yeah .
36012	0	a	Yeah .
36013	0	a	But they still need to fit into people is decor though .
36014	0	a	Right .
36015	1	a	Like look at the basic shapes of different fruits and vegetables .
36016	1	a	And then just really like strip it down to like really basic shapes .
36017	1	a	I mean we do not have to make something in the shape of a strawberry , but it could have the curves of a strawberry , or something .
36018	0	a	Yeah .
36019	0	a	The
36020	0	a	The essence of strawberry .
36021	0	a	Yeah ,
36022	0	a	yeah .
36023	1	a	Or a strawberry seed or a leaf .
36024	1	a	Or just like you know really make it a quite abstract , if that is fits in more with what we are doing .
36025	0	a	Yeah .
36026	0	a	Yeah .
36027	1	a	Instead of fruits and vegetables ,
36028	0	a	just if you look at it straightforward , it is a bit
36029	0	a	yeah .
36030	0	a	Yeah .
36031	0	a	Yeah .
36032	0	a	It does not s quite fit in with the trendy well , obviously it does , if that is the current theme .
36033	0	a	Yeah .
36034	1	a	But may maybe we could go more directly ,
36035	0	a	I do not know .
36036	0	a	Yeah .
36037	0	a	But initially , I dunno .
36038	1	a	I think if we just sort of tone it down a bit .
36039	0	a	Tone it down .
36040	0	a	I guess , yeah .
36041	0	a	Yeah and like not , not
36042	0	a	yeah .
36043	0	a	Yeah ,
36044	1	a	like more like photos of fruit , on , on our product .
36045	0	a	Yeah .
36046	1	a	Or banana shaped .
36047	0	a	One thing I was thinking though is I dunno if you all remember from our kickoff meeting , we talked about our favourite animals .
36048	0	a	Yeah .
36049	1	a	So maybe there could be animal based , you know .
36050	0	a	Because a lot of people have a house cat .
36051	0	a	Or , or a dog .
36052	0	a	, that might be getting , you know , too specific ,
36053	1	a	and we should see what the success of the first face plates are .
36054	1	a	But it is something to keep in mind .
36055	0	a	And , did you have any questions ?
36056	0	a	Pretty straightforward ?
36057	0	a	Okay .
36058	0	a	Yeah .
36059	0	a	Yeah
36060	0	a	Alright ,
36061	1	a	given that information , we need to start making some more specific decisions .
36062	1	a	So I will need to hook up the PowerPoint again .
36063	0	a	There you go .
36064	0	a	Have you guys been saving your PowerPoint presentations to the
36065	0	a	okay .
36066	0	a	I did not for the first one .
36067	0	a	But I have now .
36068	0	a	But it is still around right ?
36069	0	a	Okay .
36070	0	a	Yeah .
36071	0	a	, hopefully .
36072	0	a	Where do you have to save it to ?
36073	0	a	Okay .
36074	0	a	Project documents I think .
36075	0	a	Okay .
36076	0	a	I am just trying to make this pop up now .
36077	0	a	Alright .
36078	0	a	Here we go .
36079	0	a	Okay so we have to decide now exactly what we are going to do .
36080	0	a	So energy , we
36081	0	a	oh .
36082	0	a	Okay .
36083	0	a	Kay .
36084	0	a	Oh no
36085	0	a	I ca not write it in when it is in this setting .
36086	0	a	Does anyone know how to take it out of
36087	0	a	yeah .
36088	0	a	Just escape I think .
36089	0	a	The PowerPoint ?
36090	0	a	So
36091	0	a	So if it is not working they just have to shake it a bit and that revitalises it ?
36092	0	a	Okay .
36093	0	a	Yeah .
36094	0	a	Okay .
36095	0	a	, so back to decisions .
36096	0	a	Energy , we have decided on kinetic , right ?
36097	0	a	Okay , so that is good .
36098	0	a	Kinetic yeah .
36099	0	a	Yeah .
36100	0	a	Are we going to have a backup ?
36101	0	a	Or do we just
36102	1	a	I think maybe we could just go for the kinetic energy ,
36103	0	a	and be bold and innovative , and hope this works , and well hope that it works .
36104	0	a	But would a backup really be necessary ?
36105	0	a	I mean will people just use the battery if there is no , if there is , if there is backup .
36106	0	a	Yeah .
36107	0	a	Yeah .
36108	0	a	I think
36109	0	a	yeah .
36110	0	a	There is like no reason why it would not work , right ?
36111	0	a	Yeah .
36112	0	a	I think
36113	0	a	no .
36114	1	a	I , I think we should just like take advantage of like using this to its full potential .
36115	1	a	It could even be one of our selling points .
36116	1	a	Go for it .
36117	0	a	It could be
36118	1	a	fully kinetic energy .
36119	0	a	Yeah .
36120	0	a	Yeah .
36121	0	a	Yeah .
36122	0	a	Yeah .
36123	1	a	Environmentally conscious or something .
36124	0	a	Is everyone happy with that ?
36125	0	a	Yeah .
36126	0	a	Yeah .
36127	0	a	Hope so .
36128	0	a	Alright ,
36129	0	a	the next decision is chip on print .
36130	0	a	I do not exactly know what that means .
36131	0	a	, it was whether we went for the simple , the regular , or the advanced chip .
36132	0	a	And that linked in with what buttons we would going to have ,
36133	0	a	so
36134	0	a	Yeah ,
36135	0	a	it was
36136	0	a	so that was without the LCD .
36137	0	a	Right ,
36138	0	a	and we were going for more simplistic style , right ?
36139	0	a	Yeah .
36140	0	a	Yeah .
36141	0	a	So that means we are not doing the advanced .
36142	0	a	So it depends on whether we wanted the scroll buttons or just the push buttons .
36143	0	a	I think we decided on the pushbuttons , right ?
36144	0	a	Yeah .
36145	0	a	Yeah .
36146	0	a	I don
36147	0	a	yeah .
36148	0	a	, so that is the simple .
36149	0	a	Would we need a more advanced one for the lighting , the interior lighting system ?
36150	0	a	Yeah ?
36151	0	a	Okay .
36152	0	a	Yeah possibly .
36153	0	a	So , it is probably going to be the regular chip that we are going to need .
36154	0	a	So it is a medium .
36155	0	a	So regular chip .
36156	0	a	That is called medium , or regular ?
36157	0	a	Kay .
36158	0	a	Regular
36159	0	a	sorry .
36160	0	a	Regular chip .
36161	0	a	Oh ,
36162	0	a	is regular not simple ?
36163	0	a	Right right right .
36164	0	a	Yeah .
36165	0	a	Lighting .
36166	0	a	Yeah
36167	0	a	if we
36168	0	a	because of the lighting that we have decided to put in as well .
36169	0	a	It is for the lighting , yeah .
36170	0	a	Okay ,
36171	0	a	and cases .
36172	0	a	, does this , is this dependent on shape , or what it is made of , or what ?
36173	0	a	Yeah .
36174	0	a	So th
36175	0	a	I think this is just like going to be the a very outer case , which we will decide on rubber .
36176	0	a	Yeah .
36177	0	a	Well , I guess plastic and coated in rubber .
36178	0	a	Rubber .
36179	0	a	Yeah plastic coat .
36180	0	a	Yeah .
36181	0	a	Plastic with rubber coating and interchangeable
36182	0	a	yeah , interchangeable plates .
36183	0	a	Plastic rubber coat .
36184	0	a	Interchangeable , yeah .
36185	0	a	Still going for that .
36186	0	a	Yeah .
36187	0	a	Okay .
36188	0	a	User interface concept .
36189	1	a	This is your time to shine .
36190	0	a	We decided on the component .
36191	0	a	I , I
36192	0	a	I am sorry ,
36193	0	a	I have lost my PowerPoint thing , so I ca not remember what it is ca it is the component
36194	0	a	The command inter
36195	0	a	The command line interface yeah .
36196	0	a	Your screen ?
36197	0	a	Was it
36198	0	a	Ouch .
36199	0	a	Think it was called command interface .
36200	0	a	Oh , yeah .
36201	0	a	Yeah .
36202	0	a	Command interface , .
36203	0	a	Command interface .
36204	0	a	Did you say command line ?
36205	0	a	Okay .
36206	0	a	Yeah .
36207	0	a	Line interface .
36208	0	a	Alright ,
36209	0	a	and supplements .
36210	0	a	What is that all about ?
36211	0	a	, I think that is
36212	0	a	well we have not really made any decisions about what we are going to do about the cluster of button functions , colours and forms , in the in consistent use .
36213	1	a	Like what what are ideas to combat these problems ?
36214	0	a	You know how different interfaces are very different , and can be confusing because because of their difference , and because of the different clusters of buttons that they have .
36215	0	a	We have not really decided what to do about that .
36216	0	a	, what are our choices here ?
36217	0	a	You mean like we will have the numbers of the channels , and we will have the channel changer , and volume , and power ?
36218	0	a	Yeah .
36219	0	a	Well it is just w where where shall we locate the buttons .
36220	0	a	What kind of functions wi shall we have ?
36221	0	a	So pretty
36222	0	a	just just the basic button functions .
36223	0	a	The power .
36224	0	a	Volume .
36225	1	a	Like I do not know if we should go into like adjusting light levels , things like that ,
36226	0	a	because different televisions will have
36227	0	a	, yeah .
36228	0	a	May
36229	0	a	yeah .
36230	0	a	Tone , contrast , and things .
36231	0	a	That is a bit
36232	0	a	Yeah , it was minima
36233	0	a	well , it was not the l
36234	0	a	Yeah .
36235	0	a	That was on , one of my presentations .
36236	0	a	About how often it was used .
36237	0	a	Do you remember that ?
36238	0	a	I w
36239	1	a	Should I bring it up ?
36240	0	a	The ch t
36241	0	a	Screen settings was used zero point five times an hour .
36242	0	a	Yep .
36243	0	a	Yeah .
36244	0	a	Yeah , it was hardly ever used really .
36245	0	a	Yeah .
36246	0	a	That would be good .
36247	0	a	And most televisions will come with a remote .
36248	0	a	Yeah ,
36249	0	a	and surely that would be like quite specific to the individual television ,
36250	0	a	so
36251	0	a	Yeah , each television .
36252	0	a	Yeah .
36253	0	a	Kay ,
36254	0	a	well we know we want numbers .
36255	0	a	So tw twice every once every two hours .
36256	0	a	, and it was considered a one point five relevance , on a scale of ten .
36257	0	a	That is brightness , colour , tone , all that .
36258	0	a	You do not change that often , yeah .
36259	0	a	I think most of that comes like on the i individual television set itself ,
36260	0	a	does not it ?
36261	0	a	I am sure it has its own buttons , so you do not necessarily need to have it on remote .
36262	0	a	Yeah , it does .
36263	0	a	Yeah ,
36264	0	a	and different televisions .
36265	0	a	Yeah .
36266	0	a	Like we , I do not know if we can make a remote that would be universal to all the different kinds of changes like that .
36267	0	a	Yeah .
36268	0	a	So we are just going for power , channels , volume ,
36269	0	a	Volume .
36270	0	a	The other one was audio settings .
36271	0	a	Mono , stereo , pitch .
36272	0	a	I mean I sometimes use that .
36273	0	a	Some TVs will have the option of like living room style , movie style ,
36274	0	a	and that ,
36275	0	a	they say that is used zero point eight times an hour ,
36276	0	a	which is actually somewhat high .
36277	0	a	Yeah .
36278	0	a	Like almost once an hour .
36279	0	a	Yeah .
36280	0	a	, relevance of two .
36281	0	a	Oh .
36282	0	a	We have five minutes to finish our meeting .
36283	0	a	Crap .
36284	0	a	Okay , ,
36285	1	a	let is do this fast .
36286	0	a	Should we have audio ?
36287	0	a	It only comes up on mine usually .
36288	0	a	Well that did not some up on mine .
36289	0	a	It w
36290	0	a	it would seem silly if we would having anything else , just have an audio button though .
36291	0	a	Oh .
36292	0	a	Do you know ?
36293	0	a	But we
36294	0	a	Yeah .
36295	0	a	Yeah ,
36296	0	a	I do not , I it is ,
36297	0	a	it is a problem with the international appeal , I think .
36298	0	a	, if we have audio because we do not know how other televisions work .
36299	0	a	But we know that everyone has this
36300	0	a	and it is the same .
36301	0	a	Yeah
36302	0	a	I guess that it affects the marketing ,
36303	1	a	cause it , it is a good sales ploy to say , are not you annoyed with remote controls that have all these buttons .
36304	0	a	I have
36305	0	a	Yeah , that is it .
36306	1	a	This one has channel , volume and your channe and your power .
36307	1	a	That could be a sales pitch .
36308	1	a	We can just go for , make it a selling point that it is just the basic .
36309	0	a	Yeah .
36310	0	a	Yeah .
36311	1	a	Simple and
36312	0	a	Yeah .
36313	0	a	Yeah .
36314	0	a	Yeah
36315	0	a	I
36316	0	a	brilliant .
36317	0	a	Okay .
36318	0	a	Alright .
36319	0	a	Good .
36320	0	a	And , okay , in closing , cause we only have five minutes .
36321	0	a	We will be meeting again in thirty minutes .
36322	0	a	, you will be working , Poppy will be working on the look and feel design .
36323	0	a	Wait a minute .
36324	0	a	Is that right ?
36325	0	a	Yep ,
36326	0	a	and the user interface design , so this is where the trendy stuff comes in .
36327	0	a	And you will be evaluating the product .
36328	0	a	Poppy and Tara will have to work together , using modelling clay .
36329	0	a	And , , your personal coach will give you the rest of the information of what needs to happen .
36330	0	a	Okay .
36331	0	a	Alright .
36332	1	a	So , anyone else have something to say ?
36333	0	a	Yeah .
36334	1	a	, I just have one question about the whole fruit and vegetable aspect .
36335	0	a	Yeah .
36336	0	a	Are we
36337	1	a	seeing as that was the most popular thing that came up out of your market research , I thi
36338	1	a	I think we should keep to that rather than moving to animals or something ,
36339	0	a	because even if that may not seem obvious to us , if that is what the surveys brought out , I think that we should probably go along with that .
36340	0	a	Yeah .
36341	0	a	Yeah .
36342	0	a	Yeah .
36343	0	a	, so I suppose that will come out in our dev design development .
36344	0	a	But you are happy to go ahead with the fruit and veg ?
36345	0	a	Y Yeah .
36346	0	a	Now do you guys need want an idea of how many
36347	0	a	are you going to come up with casing ideas ?
36348	1	a	Like f five different
36349	0	a	Yeah .
36350	0	a	What I
36351	0	a	What I was thinking
36352	0	a	what do yous think of this ?
36353	1	a	, having the numbers kind of like , not a bunch of grapes , but you know like purple and kind of in a triangle .
36354	0	a	five .
36355	1	a	Like grapes .
36356	0	a	Yeah you can have some fun with the buttons , it is true .
36357	0	a	Like that is kind of fruity or something .
36358	0	a	That is just
36359	0	a	Yeah .
36360	0	a	Yeah .
36361	0	a	We can have a look at those ideas , yeah .
36362	0	a	Yeah .
36363	1	a	I guess what you i ideally you would kind of think of age markets as well .
36364	0	a	So it is a something that will , you know , appeal to the fifteen to twenty five year olds .
36365	0	a	Yeah .
36366	0	a	Something that your granny would want on her remote control .
36367	0	a	, and international tastes as well , so
36368	0	a	Not easy .
36369	0	a	Yeah .
36370	0	a	Yeah .
36371	0	a	Tricky .
36372	0	a	A lot of things to consider .
36373	0	a	Yeah .
36374	0	a	Lots of
36375	0	a	yeah .
36376	0	a	Hm .
36377	0	a	Alright .
36378	0	a	Okay .
36379	1	a	Kay we will stick to the fruit and veggie theme then .
36380	0	a	Alright .
36381	0	a	And , , we will reconvene in thirty minutes .
36382	0	a	Okay .
36383	0	a	Kay .
36384	0	a	Bye .
36385	0	a	I will see you later .
36386	0	a	Oh , what did I just do .
36387	0	a	 
36388	0	a	Okay .
36389	0	a	Here we go .
36390	0	a	Alright ,
36391	0	a	the agenda for thi
36392	0	a	oh .
36393	0	a	Alright .
36394	0	a	the agenda for this meeting is we will initially have the prototype presentation by our two designers .
36395	0	a	And then we will evaluate it , given the criteria that that we gave gave it .
36396	0	a	And talk about our finances , whether we were under or over our budget .
36397	0	a	I have a a spreadsheet where we can calculate our prices for every aspect of of what we have made , given our options .
36398	0	a	And evaluate the product , as a group .
36399	0	a	Okay .
36400	0	a	And
36401	0	a	So first we will have the prototype presentation .
36402	0	a	Do you need the PowerPoint for this ?
36403	0	a	Alright .
36404	0	a	yeah .
36405	0	a	I just got a few slides , so show them .
36406	0	a	Thank you .
36407	1	a	Do you want to present it ?
36408	0	a	Yeah , here we are .
36409	0	a	This is what we came up with .
36410	0	a	It is a pretty simple design .
36411	0	a	It is based on a mango ?
36412	0	a	Yeah .
36413	0	a	And we
36414	0	a	Yeah .
36415	0	a	On ?
36416	0	a	A mango .
36417	0	a	Mango shape .
36418	0	a	Okay .
36419	0	a	And we have the company logo here and this will be the infrared here and this will be the power point , the on off button kind
36420	0	a	yeah .
36421	0	a	The LED .
36422	0	a	Oh .
36423	0	a	Okay .
36424	0	a	I am sorry .
36425	0	a	What was the
36426	0	a	where is the LED ?
36427	0	a	Oh .
36428	0	a	Oops .
36429	0	a	It is in the middle of one of the little Rs .
36430	0	a	Okay .
36431	0	a	And then the other one is the power .
36432	0	a	And we just have a simple design .
36433	0	a	We wanted it all to be accessible from your thumb
36434	0	a	yeah
36435	0	a	palm held
36436	0	a	and all the buttons are accessible from your thumb .
36437	0	a	So it is palm held .
36438	0	a	Yeah .
36439	0	a	Yeah .
36440	0	a	Notice you have a number ten button .
36441	0	a	So you do not have to
36442	0	a	Oh that was a mistake ,
36443	0	a	was not it ?
36444	0	a	Right no , that is a zero .
36445	0	a	You just need the nought .
36446	1	a	Take that one off .
36447	0	a	Okay .
36448	0	a	Sorry .
36449	0	a	I was in charge of the numbers .
36450	0	a	No problem .
36451	0	a	And this is just if you have got like eleven or twelve or thirt the plus .
36452	0	a	So one plus one would be eleven ,
36453	0	a	or
36454	0	a	Yeah
36455	0	a	because if you
36456	0	a	on your average remote , if you press one twice you just go to or say you wanted channel twelve
36457	0	a	, you press one ,
36458	0	a	and then you go to channel one , and then two then you would just go to channel two , instead of twelve .
36459	0	a	You can go one , three or something .
36460	0	a	Oh .
36461	0	a	You press that first
36462	0	a	and then you go one three
36463	0	a	yeah .
36464	0	a	You press a plus button ?
36465	0	a	Oh okay .
36466	0	a	I have never heard of that kind before .
36467	0	a	Well we just thought , we have all the numbers here , so we wanted something representative of numbers larger than ten and
36468	0	a	So the plus and then
36469	0	a	yeah .
36470	0	a	Yeah .
36471	0	a	Yeah .
36472	0	a	Oh ,
36473	0	a	there is no e
36474	0	a	okay .
36475	0	a	So if you did like one plus two you could go to channel twelve , or two plus two is channel twenty two .
36476	0	a	Oh .
36477	0	a	I
36478	0	a	But
36479	0	a	Would you have to go zero plus one if you wanted to go to channel one or two ?
36480	0	a	Yeah
36481	0	a	but I mean if you press , it will go to that channel right away .
36482	0	a	Okay .
36483	0	a	No no ,
36484	0	a	th all
36485	0	a	that is why we have all these numbers .
36486	0	a	These numbers
36487	0	a	these numbers all work independently up to nine .
36488	0	a	Yeah .
36489	0	a	Cause you gotta press the plus afterwards .
36490	0	a	Oh no .
36491	0	a	, the plus is only for if you are going past the number nine .
36492	0	a	Yeah I know ,
36493	0	a	but if if I want to go to say number like sixty five , channel sixty five , if I press the six it will go to channel six , and then I will press the plus , and then it will go to six and then put the five and it will go to sixty five ?
36494	0	a	I th
36495	0	a	Yeah it would not be a problem .
36496	0	a	Sixty .
36497	0	a	You p
36498	0	a	Oh .
36499	0	a	No you press the plus first .
36500	0	a	I
36501	0	a	I
36502	0	a	well it does not we have not really
36503	0	a	s
36504	0	a	I would have thought you pressed the plus first and then the six five , but she says plus press which
36505	0	a	what do you think is simpler ?
36506	0	a	It is a
36507	0	a	Yeah .
36508	0	a	Oh .
36509	0	a	Well I do not mind ,
36510	1	a	we can further define that .
36511	0	a	I would not have thought it would be a problem that it went to channel six first , in like on the way to channel sixty five .
36512	0	a	Yeah .
36513	0	a	But I was just wondering like as long as we realise that is what it will do .
36514	0	a	But I suppose it is not as snappy .
36515	0	a	Well the there is a there is a delay on remotes I think .
36516	0	a	Oops .
36517	0	a	Where you can have it
36518	0	a	it is like a five second input time .
36519	0	a	Yeah .
36520	0	a	Yeah .
36521	0	a	Yeah .
36522	0	a	If you do not put it
36523	0	a	Yeah .
36524	0	a	So as long as you hit them dada
36525	0	a	it should be fine .
36526	0	a	Yeah .
36527	0	a	Yeah ,
36528	0	a	that
36529	0	a	yeah .
36530	0	a	Yeah .
36531	0	a	As long as there is not a big pause between the t hitting the two buttons .
36532	0	a	Yeah .
36533	0	a	So
36534	0	a	A channel .
36535	0	a	And channel , which is so you could just go like that without thinking about it , like It is the bigger R .
36536	0	a	Was there
36537	0	a	so on the top there is volume and
36538	0	a	Channel up volume up .
36539	0	a	Okay cool .
36540	0	a	C and V .
36541	0	a	Just so we can flick
36542	0	a	It is in the middle of one of the little Rs .
36543	0	a	Right ,
36544	0	a	where where is the power button ?
36545	0	a	Oh okay .
36546	0	a	Yeah .
36547	0	a	It is the R .
36548	0	a	So it is just like .
36549	0	a	Yeah ,
36550	0	a	so it is all accessible .
36551	0	a	Yeah .
36552	0	a	We deci
36553	0	a	Yeah
36554	0	a	we went for like a a circular design for the numbers because we thought that is kind of a more natural movement than just going like that with your thumb .
36555	0	a	Without m taking your hand off the remote .
36556	0	a	Yeah .
36557	0	a	Oh okay .
36558	0	a	e ergonomics are all considered .
36559	0	a	Yeah .
36560	0	a	And it might actually help with the repetitive stress injury as well .
36561	0	a	Ergonomic , definitely ergonomic .
36562	0	a	It could cause another type of repetitive stress injury though .
36563	0	a	Okay .
36564	0	a	But yeah
36565	0	a	, no I mean it is a different movement
36566	0	a	so yeah .
36567	0	a	Yeah .
36568	0	a	and the feel of it
36569	0	a	, I mean , we have made this out of Play Doh , which is representing the , you know , the rubber , and the spongy rubberness .
36570	0	a	The spon yeah .
36571	0	a	Yeah .
36572	0	a	cause it was said before in the material specification that this the this anti RSI material is often used in stress balls so this has got a you know a bit of give to it , and it just feels feels different .
36573	0	a	Yeah .
36574	0	a	Yeah .
36575	0	a	Bit of a stress ball feel .
36576	0	a	Yeah .
36577	1	a	Would you like to feel it yourselves ?
36578	1	a	How it fits in the palm of your hand ?
36579	0	a	Thanks .
36580	1	a	Yes .
36581	1	a	I would .
36582	0	a	My goodness .
36583	0	a	There you go .
36584	1	a	And you ?
36585	0	a	O
36586	0	a	Okay , as for the colours , we were presented with a limited range of colours for this prototype .
36587	1	a	Yes
36588	0	a	Genevieve ?
36589	0	a	Yeah .
36590	0	a	Oh it is nice .
36591	0	a	Oh I think I killed the five .
36592	0	a	I did .
36593	0	a	I killed the four .
36594	0	a	And something .
36595	0	a	Oh god .
36596	0	a	Oh it smells good .
36597	0	a	Of Play Doh
36598	0	a	yeah .
36599	0	a	But we are thinking that , seeing as we are having it in interchangeable casing anyway , that this is not necessarily a representation of the true colours that we would necessarily use .
36600	0	a	Or the combination .
36601	1	a	and we are thinking to carry on with the fruit and vegetable theme , the colour combination just could just be named after different fruit , like banana could be black and yellow , watermelon red and green ,
36602	0	a	or vanilla might be the most popular if it just blends in more settled cream instead of the others are all a bit garish .
36603	0	a	Oh right .
36604	0	a	Cause it would be quite subtle and
36605	0	a	Yeah .
36606	0	a	Yeah .
36607	0	a	It looks more
36608	0	a	Think like vanilla and banana would .
36609	0	a	Banana is more representative of our colour scheme , like the company the yellow and black .
36610	0	a	Okay yeah .
36611	0	a	So that for corporate identity that would probably be the most strength .
36612	0	a	I mean watermelon , you know , m probably appealing to the
36613	0	a	yeah , seasonal .
36614	0	a	Kinda Christmas , you know .
36615	0	a	Yeah ,
36616	0	a	yeah ,
36617	0	a	yeah .
36618	0	a	Apple green , brown , more kind of trendy , you know , khaki
36619	0	a	Yeah .
36620	0	a	Yeah .
36621	0	a	The pomegranate is kind of girly and funky kind of , and then the vanilla is more for the more sophisticated customer who just wants something that fits in with all decor .
36622	0	a	Cool .
36623	0	a	Okay .
36624	0	a	yeah
36625	0	a	we thought of the components it was definitely a focus of ergonomics and just a single ha handheld device , I mean you do not need to use both hands , one hand to hold this and type in with the other , you can just use your thumb .
36626	0	a	Yeah .
36627	0	a	, as we said the rubber is probably used for comfort and anti RSI and that is about it .
36628	0	a	Alright ,
36629	0	a	thank you very much .
36630	0	a	Good work everyone .
36631	0	a	Bravo
36632	0	a	You want the
36633	0	a	I do not know what order it goes in .
36634	0	a	Alright .
36635	1	a	And so now that we have we have a prototype , we need to go over the finances and seeing if this prototype matches what our budget can handle .
36636	0	a	So , I have something I am going to
36637	0	a	Oh wait a minute .
36638	1	a	Do you need to do a presentation first ?
36639	0	a	Yeah .
36640	1	a	I am going to check that out for a second .
36641	0	a	I have one .
36642	0	a	go
36643	0	a	Feel I think .
36644	0	a	What time is it anyw
36645	0	a	Oh yeah
36646	0	a	sorry
36647	0	a	you are right .
36648	0	a	Evaluation cri
36649	0	a	Okay .
36650	0	a	Evaluation criteria is next in line .
36651	0	a	That is me .
36652	0	a	Yeah .
36653	0	a	Hello .
36654	0	a	Oh there we go .
36655	0	a	Okay .
36656	0	a	Come on my computer .
36657	0	a	Come on .
36658	0	a	Sorry
36659	0	a	my computer is giving me technical difficulties .
36660	1	a	Just press function eight again .
36661	0	a	Should I press it again ?
36662	0	a	Last time I did that it sh
36663	0	a	Okay .
36664	0	a	You are right .
36665	1	a	And then again I think .
36666	1	a	One more time .
36667	0	a	Oh .
36668	0	a	Still not there .
36669	0	a	Yeah .
36670	0	a	Yeah .
36671	0	a	Okay now I think for this one I could
36672	0	a	Would you guys prefer use the whiteboard
36673	1	a	or mayb maybe I will just do it on right on the screen where you can see it .
36674	0	a	, we are going to be doing an evaluation report together based on the protoptype that we have just seen .
36675	0	a	and looking looking back at my notes from our both our conceptual and our functional meetings , I made a list of what our original requirements and goals were , , back to our kick off meeting this morning .
36676	0	a	, and we will evaluate as to whether we have s done what we set out to do .
36677	0	a	and we are going to do it on a one to seven scale where one is true and seven is false .
36678	0	a	So basically the lower p the lower the points the better .
36679	0	a	Okay so question number one .
36680	0	a	Does the remote
36681	0	a	whoops .
36682	0	a	Sorry .
36683	0	a	Oh I am not going to be able
36684	1	a	, I will do it on the whiteboard .
36685	0	a	I ca not change it
36686	1	a	so I am g
36687	1	a	I am going to ask you to push it down once .
36688	0	a	Okay .
36689	1	a	I will write down our scores up on the
36690	0	a	Okay so number one .
36691	0	a	Ooh .
36692	0	a	Do we have a fancy look and feel ?
36693	0	a	Yeah I guess that depends on your definition of fancy , but it is definitely different .
36694	0	a	We have been quite successful with the rubber coating
36695	0	a	and
36696	0	a	Yeah .
36697	0	a	Yeah .
36698	0	a	The look is a little bit more playful .
36699	0	a	Well
36700	0	a	Yeah .
36701	0	a	It is not your traditional
36702	0	a	yeah .
36703	0	a	Oh definitely different
36704	0	a	yeah .
36705	0	a	I think the colour has a lot to do with it .
36706	0	a	I mean th the colours we were given for making the prototype are not the colours that I think we would have necessarily chosen .
36707	0	a	Yeah .
36708	0	a	It is not the kind of ooh at all sleek
36709	0	a	red , black and yellow , and orange .
36710	0	a	Oh you were only given red and black ?
36711	0	a	Oh okay .
36712	0	a	Yeah so not very sleek
36713	1	a	and we do not want to go for black because most remote controls are black or grey .
36714	1	a	But if you can imagine that in like a s just a maybe a kind of pale metallic y finish or something
36715	0	a	Well I know know it is for rubber .
36716	0	a	Yeah .
36717	0	a	So we want it to be stand out that way , anyway .
36718	0	a	Yeah .
36719	0	a	Okay .
36720	0	a	Yeah .
36721	0	a	A metallic y finish we were thinking .
36722	0	a	Yeah .
36723	0	a	Polished .
36724	0	a	I mean diff if you can visualise this in nice colours
36725	0	a	I think it would look quite fancy .
36726	0	a	Okay
36727	0	a	Yeah .
36728	0	a	Yeah .
36729	0	a	Yeah .
36730	0	a	I kind of I like the potato look .
36731	0	a	It is mango .
36732	0	a	It is very different .
36733	0	a	Oh well , potato , mango , fruit and veg .
36734	0	a	We we were we were thinking about
36735	0	a	yeah .
36736	0	a	It is what ?
36737	0	a	Oh sorry
36738	0	a	the mango the mango look .
36739	0	a	It is mango .
36740	0	a	Potato is fine .
36741	0	a	Yeah it is , fruit or vegetable depends on your mood .
36742	0	a	Potato is fine .
36743	0	a	Yeah .
36744	0	a	Totally .
36745	0	a	It is really adaptable .
36746	0	a	So I myself would say a one or a two .
36747	0	a	Yeah .
36748	0	a	I would say two .
36749	0	a	Personally .
36750	0	a	I w I would say two I think .
36751	0	a	It is a two ?
36752	0	a	Okay ,
36753	0	a	and p
36754	0	a	One being true .
36755	0	a	For the
36756	0	a	fancy
36757	0	a	I two , three .
36758	0	a	Fanciness .
36759	0	a	Yeah .
36760	0	a	So
36761	0	a	Two .
36762	0	a	Okay , actu that is pro that is going to get confusing , like that .
36763	0	a	Yeah .
36764	0	a	Okay so question number two was is it techn technologically innovative ?
36765	0	a	So I know we have the kinetic energy which is very innovative .
36766	0	a	Yeah .
36767	0	a	Yeah
36768	0	a	and the use of the rubber .
36769	0	a	Use of the rubber , the use of the LED .
36770	0	a	Yeah .
36771	0	a	For the anti RSI .
36772	0	a	Yeah .
36773	0	a	The LED use is not particularly innovative
36774	0	a	and we do not have any scroll buttons , it is all pushbuttons , there is no LCD control ,
36775	0	a	so if we are thinking about the rest of the market , it is sort of probably halfway .
36776	0	a	Is not
36777	0	a	Yeah .
36778	0	a	In some aspects it is , like we said .
36779	0	a	Yeah .
36780	0	a	I would say maybe three .
36781	0	a	I will go for three as well .
36782	0	a	Yeah .
36783	0	a	And I think I mean it it is tough to say
36784	0	a	because we were
36785	0	a	we did not want it to be any more innovative than this , because then that would have defeated the purpose .
36786	0	a	Yeah .
36787	0	a	No .
36788	0	a	Yeah we want it simple .
36789	0	a	Though it was our specification .
36790	0	a	Would not be simple , yeah .
36791	0	a	So I mean I
36792	1	a	we will put three ,
36793	0	a	but I think we actually reached our goal .
36794	0	a	Yeah .
36795	0	a	Yeah .
36796	0	a	We did not want it any more than that .
36797	0	a	Okay question number three .
36798	0	a	, will it be easy to use ?
36799	0	a	Yeah .
36800	0	a	I think so .
36801	0	a	Yeah .
36802	0	a	Yeah very .
36803	0	a	Yeah .
36804	0	a	Yeah .
36805	0	a	Yeah .
36806	0	a	I think one for that .
36807	0	a	S
36808	0	a	Yeah
36809	0	a	I think it is
36810	0	a	you ca not really get confused with that .
36811	0	a	Yeah .
36812	0	a	Yeah .
36813	0	a	One .
36814	0	a	Yeah .
36815	0	a	No .
36816	1	a	I mean , there will be s
36817	1	a	we have to work out the number the plus system .
36818	0	a	Th
36819	0	a	The plus number thing .
36820	0	a	Yeah that is the only thing
36821	0	a	yeah .
36822	0	a	But once that is figured out , it should be fine .
36823	0	a	Yeah and perhaps the turning on
36824	0	a	but
36825	0	a	Number four .
36826	0	a	Is this a good looking remote ?
36827	0	a	Remember that seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly .
36828	0	a	Again I think the colour comes into this .
36829	0	a	It is definitely
36830	0	a	Yeah .
36831	0	a	Yeah colour will definitely be a factor .
36832	1	a	I think that the logo could be smaller .
36833	0	a	Okay .
36834	1	a	And maybe not such a prominent way .
36835	0	a	But the
36836	0	a	Remember the management said that it it had to be prominent .
36837	1	a	Maybe like at the bottom , kind of .
36838	0	a	Not in
36839	0	a	Do not worry .
36840	0	a	Whoops .
36841	0	a	Oh it just had to be on there I guess .
36842	0	a	Should just not touch it .
36843	0	a	Yeah .
36844	0	a	This time it is the three I killed .
36845	1	a	I was just wondering if it should be like flatter .
36846	0	a	Or
36847	0	a	Well
36848	0	a	Yeah
36849	1	a	the bottom could be like ch chopped a bit .
36850	0	a	I suppose I have got quite big hands .
36851	0	a	I like the appeal of it being like a big glob in your hand .
36852	0	a	Yeah .
36853	0	a	But you know what I have just thought of there now .
36854	0	a	What
36855	0	a	where is it going to sit in your living room ?
36856	0	a	Is it not going to fall off the arm of the sofa ?
36857	0	a	Yeah .
36858	1	a	Maybe if the bottom was just sort of flat , and then the rest is like round .
36859	0	a	But then it would not sit as comfortably in your hand .
36860	0	a	Oh .
36861	0	a	That is true .
36862	0	a	It would still be comfortable I think .
36863	0	a	Thing is like that , it is not going anywhere particularly .
36864	0	a	We c we could handle it I think .
36865	1	a	Maybe , it could it could be on the bottom ,
36866	0	a	so you would not loo
36867	1	a	like if it is flat here , so it sits up .
36868	0	a	Yeah .
36869	0	a	Yeah .
36870	0	a	Like that .
36871	0	a	Oh that would be nice .
36872	0	a	it would fall over all the time though .
36873	0	a	It would be annoying .
36874	0	a	yeah ,
36875	0	a	it is less , what is th ha .
36876	0	a	Yeah .
36877	0	a	I g
36878	1	a	If it is weighted maybe .
36879	0	a	H it is got higher centre of gravity like that .
36880	0	a	Details , details .
36881	0	a	Kay we are done designing .
36882	0	a	Okay .
36883	0	a	Come on .
36884	0	a	So , is this a good looking remote ?
36885	0	a	Would we want to show it off to our friends ?
36886	0	a	Yeah .
36887	0	a	Three .
36888	0	a	You would though , cause it is bit it is more interesting than other remotes .
36889	0	a	I think , it was another colour and
36890	0	a	it was like I think it would look okay .
36891	0	a	I think maybe a two .
36892	0	a	Yeah ?
36893	0	a	I mean I gue
36894	0	a	yeah , it is personal taste ,
36895	0	a	but
36896	0	a	Yeah .
36897	0	a	I would definitely go for that rather than like your average plain old remote like that , but definitely in another colour , I am not happy with those colours .
36898	0	a	Yeah .
36899	0	a	Okay , so should we say two for that ?
36900	0	a	Yeah ?
36901	0	a	Okay .
36902	0	a	Sure .
36903	0	a	Yeah .
36904	0	a	Yeah .
36905	0	a	, question number five .
36906	0	a	What is
36907	0	a	will people be willing to spend twenty five Euros on this product ?
36908	0	a	Remember that eighty percent of users were willing to spend more money when a remote control looked fancy .
36909	1	a	I think we have to market it in the right way , that to say that it is simplistic .
36910	0	a	Yeah .
36911	0	a	So people do not just see it and think ,
36912	0	a	, this is so simplistic , I do not want to spend twenty five Euros .
36913	0	a	Yeah .
36914	1	a	We have to market it .
36915	0	a	Yeah it the marketing will have a lot to do with it .
36916	0	a	Yeah .
36917	0	a	And the kinetic energy , shaker style y , whoo ,
36918	0	a	ooh no .
36919	0	a	And the kinetic energy part .
36920	0	a	Yeah .
36921	0	a	Yeah .
36922	0	a	Shake it and the buttons fall off .
36923	0	a	Durable .
36924	1	a	Do not shake
36925	0	a	Oh no the plus .
36926	0	a	But you know , those will be firmly on .
36927	0	a	You are
36928	1	a	use the zero .
36929	0	a	No , I guess , I do not know much about the remote control industry , how much your average sells for ,
36930	0	a	but
36931	0	a	I know I am , are not I ?
36932	0	a	But you do not have to buy batteries .
36933	1	a	Make a new one .
36934	0	a	But you are our Marketing Expert .
36935	0	a	I think they are about ten po ten pound ,
36936	0	a	are not they ?
36937	0	a	About ten pounds .
36938	0	a	Fifteen ?
36939	0	a	Yeah .
36940	0	a	So in the long term this can actually save you money .
36941	0	a	, yeah , that is true .
36942	0	a	Oh .
36943	1	a	So we will market it that way too .
36944	0	a	Exactly .
36945	0	a	Yeah .
36946	0	a	Exactly .
36947	0	a	So yeah I think with a good marketing scheme and the personalisation options , it will
36948	0	a	Yeah .
36949	0	a	Good point .
36950	0	a	Yeah .
36951	0	a	I would give it a two still though .
36952	0	a	Yeah .
36953	0	a	Yeah .
36954	0	a	Okay number six .
36955	1	a	Can someone read it out ?
36956	0	a	Or yeah .
36957	0	a	Does this prototype match the operating behaviour of the average user .
36958	0	a	Yeah .
36959	0	a	So that was mainly that the statistics
36960	0	a	we said
36961	0	a	Yeah .
36962	0	a	I think it does very well .
36963	0	a	Oh yeah .
36964	0	a	Because
36965	0	a	yeah ,
36966	0	a	because the most accessible buttons are the volume and the and the channel changing .
36967	0	a	The zap
36968	0	a	yeah .
36969	0	a	And it is just you wo not have to think about it .
36970	0	a	Yeah .
36971	0	a	You do not have to look down to find them .
36972	0	a	They are clearly there ,
36973	0	a	easy to use .
36974	0	a	Yeah .
36975	0	a	Yeah
36976	0	a	I guess the I think the key word there is average , cause there were some people that used the video input and sound and stuff .
36977	0	a	Simple .
36978	0	a	Yeah .
36979	0	a	Yeah .
36980	0	a	But they are not you and I really .
36981	0	a	So .
36982	0	a	Yeah .
36983	0	a	Okay so one ?
36984	0	a	Okay .
36985	0	a	Yeah .
36986	0	a	Number seven .
36987	1	a	C Heather could you push it down ?
36988	0	a	Will this remote control be easy to find when lost ?
36989	0	a	Remember that fifty percent of users lose their remote regularly .
36990	0	a	Now is there the
36991	0	a	is the alarm system still was it implemented ?
36992	0	a	It turns into a duck and starts quacking .
36993	0	a	We have the alarm system .
36994	0	a	Yeah
36995	0	a	the bu
36996	0	a	when you press the alarm system , the lights behind the and it will vibra It will be again in the marketing .
36997	0	a	It
36998	0	a	Yeah
36999	0	a	l lights on and , or flash as well .
37000	0	a	But I mean it is not obviously obvious from the outside that that is going to happen cause you ca not s particularly see an alarm .
37001	0	a	I thought the light from the inside was going to light up .
37002	0	a	Yeah .
37003	0	a	The light it will .
37004	0	a	Or or was it going to make a noise ?
37005	0	a	You press the button it makes a noise
37006	0	a	right ?
37007	0	a	Yeah .
37008	0	a	But But both
37009	0	a	Yeah .
37010	0	a	Yeah .
37011	0	a	But when the alarm is not
37012	0	a	yeah
37013	0	a	If you
37014	0	a	Yeah .
37015	0	a	You could s
37016	0	a	Yeah .
37017	0	a	Here I am .
37018	0	a	Awesome .
37019	0	a	Oh , that would be brilliant .
37020	0	a	Awesome .
37021	0	a	I would be tempted to
37022	0	a	Yeah .
37023	0	a	Well the thing is , if it was had an alarm system ,
37024	1	a	I mean , when it when it lights up as we
37025	1	a	I mean it could light up when the alarm went .
37026	0	a	Okay .
37027	0	a	But if it was hidden underneath the cushion or something , there would not be any point .
37028	0	a	So you ca not see the alarm , but it would light up .
37029	0	a	It would have to be in the market
37030	0	a	Yeah
37031	0	a	but you still could not see it .
37032	0	a	I though w it was going to make a noise .
37033	0	a	Yeah .
37034	0	a	Alarm ,
37035	0	a	but you ca not see an alarm inside the alarm system itself .
37036	0	a	It would just be a little speaker on the back or something .
37037	0	a	Okay .
37038	0	a	We
37039	0	a	oh you are just explaining why it is not on the prototype .
37040	0	a	Yeah .
37041	0	a	But yeah , it will be there .
37042	0	a	Yeah .
37043	0	a	So we can we could say that
37044	1	a	We can give it a one ,
37045	0	a	because compared to every other remote ever m ever made , this one will be easier to find .
37046	0	a	Oh okay .
37047	0	a	It w yeah .
37048	0	a	Whoo .
37049	0	a	Okay .
37050	0	a	Sorry .
37051	0	a	Yeah , totally .
37052	0	a	Yeah .
37053	0	a	Okay .
37054	0	a	Question number eight .
37055	0	a	Sorry Heather .
37056	0	a	That was not very clear .
37057	0	a	No problem , .
37058	0	a	Will it be easy to learn how to use this remote when brand new ?
37059	0	a	Remember that thirty four percent of users usually found it difficult .
37060	0	a	So it has to be
37061	0	a	yeah , it is eas they will pick it up and they will know what to do .
37062	0	a	Totally .
37063	0	a	So the plu the plus
37064	0	a	w once that is written down on the page that will be really simple ,
37065	0	a	wo not it ?
37066	0	a	Yeah .
37067	0	a	The plus thing needs to be worked on .
37068	0	a	Yeah .
37069	0	a	Yeah
37070	0	a	I think
37071	0	a	just because it is we have decided to reduce it down to the basic buttons , I think that in itself makes it so much easier to use .
37072	0	a	Yeah .
37073	0	a	Well Do
37074	0	a	Does it make more sense for the middle one to be an just an enter button ?
37075	0	a	So then you would have to push two buttons every time at least .
37076	0	a	Yeah ,
37077	0	a	so it is just like channel six , six , enter .
37078	0	a	That kind of annoys me though , when it is zero six when you have to press
37079	0	a	I do not know why .
37080	0	a	Yeah but you do not have to press zeros .
37081	0	a	You could just press six enter , or one two enter .
37082	0	a	Oh okay .
37083	0	a	And or sixty six enter , y
37084	0	a	Yeah I think that is probably more straightforward .
37085	0	a	And then like twelve , enter .
37086	0	a	Right .
37087	0	a	Alright , aye .
37088	0	a	Yeah .
37089	0	a	Yeah .
37090	0	a	Yeah .
37091	0	a	Good
37092	0	a	Ooh .
37093	0	a	Yeah .
37094	0	a	, okay
37095	0	a	so
37096	0	a	we can
37097	0	a	we will say yes it is one ?
37098	0	a	Okay .
37099	0	a	I would say w yeah one .
37100	0	a	Yeah .
37101	0	a	Yeah .
37102	0	a	Question number nine .
37103	0	a	Oh .
37104	0	a	, will it minimise the effects of RSI ,
37105	0	a	which was repeated strain injury ? , which affected over a quarter of users .
37106	0	a	Yeah .
37107	0	a	Injury .
37108	0	a	S
37109	0	a	It is soft ,
37110	0	a	and And people could
37111	0	a	I think so .
37112	0	a	It is like right in the
37113	0	a	Your thumb might get a little bit
37114	0	a	Yeah .
37115	0	a	But if you are zapping
37116	0	a	yeah .
37117	0	a	Yeah , that is what I was thinking .
37118	0	a	I do not think it will f
37119	0	a	Yeah ,
37120	0	a	the biology .
37121	1	a	We may have to do some more research into other strain injuries that we do not know about .
37122	0	a	But it is soft .
37123	0	a	And that is kind of what the the PowerPoint slide thing said would be good for RSI ,
37124	0	a	so maybe it is
37125	0	a	but
37126	0	a	Yeah .
37127	0	a	Yeah .
37128	0	a	Yeah .
37129	0	a	I do not know what other options there are .
37130	0	a	I think we are getting
37131	0	a	that is true .
37132	0	a	Could
37133	0	a	I mean , you could hold it in your left hand and d use your index finger .
37134	0	a	But there is not really any other options unless it is like a keyboard .
37135	0	a	So , I think we did as as much as you can with a remote control .
37136	0	a	Yeah .
37137	0	a	Yeah .
37138	0	a	Yeah .
37139	0	a	So , one or two do you think ?
37140	0	a	Two okay .
37141	0	a	I I would say t two .
37142	0	a	I think
37143	0	a	yeah , I think too .
37144	0	a	Yeah
37145	0	a	Yeah .
37146	0	a	Okay number ten .
37147	0	a	Did we somehow incorporate the company colour and logo ?
37148	0	a	Now is the colour going to be there even if it is like vanilla ?
37149	0	a	Is the yellow
37150	0	a	Yes we did .
37151	0	a	Yeah .
37152	0	a	N We we ca not really do that because for example on the banana theme we ca not have it as being yellow .
37153	0	a	It wo not stand out .
37154	0	a	So n it is not always going to be the same colour .
37155	0	a	It sounds like the colour is something
37156	0	a	that we
37157	0	a	But I mean the yell
37158	0	a	yeah
37159	0	a	d yellow is ugly though ,
37160	0	a	depending on the
37161	1	a	So I think we will have to talk to our executive managers , and see if we can get away with just the RR .
37162	0	a	Well , yeah the colours are yellow and grey .
37163	0	a	Yeah .
37164	0	a	Gray , yeah .
37165	1	a	So it could be grey on the banana one .
37166	0	a	Yeah , could be grey .
37167	0	a	Yeah .
37168	0	a	Yeah that is right ,
37169	0	a	we did not even rea
37170	0	a	Yeah .
37171	0	a	Yeah .
37172	0	a	I think this is the the factor that we have been least successful in confronting .
37173	0	a	Okay .
37174	1	a	Perhaps a metallic
37175	0	a	or or
37176	0	a	like that is grey , and it would not be that expensive to have a little bit of metal .
37177	0	a	, yeah .
37178	0	a	No ?
37179	0	a	That is not rubber .
37180	0	a	Yeah .
37181	0	a	And the buttons in the middle .
37182	0	a	Okay
37183	0	a	Yeah .
37184	0	a	So , do you think that is more of a three then ?
37185	0	a	Three , four ?
37186	0	a	Four ?
37187	0	a	Well we have good reasons for it ,
37188	1	a	so we but we can still put a a four ?
37189	0	a	Okay ,
37190	0	a	and final question .
37191	0	a	Four I think .
37192	0	a	Well I do not what do what
37193	0	a	Okay .
37194	0	a	Hum .
37195	0	a	Okay .
37196	0	a	, did we stay true to our motto and put the fashion into electronics ?
37197	0	a	Current trends of fruits and veggies , desire for sponginess .
37198	0	a	I would say so .
37199	0	a	Following that briefing we did .
37200	0	a	But maybe more like two
37201	0	a	cause there is no like pictures of fruit , it is just sort of naming it by a fruit .
37202	0	a	Yeah .
37203	0	a	Yeah .
37204	0	a	Yeah .
37205	0	a	With the with the colours .
37206	0	a	Like the colour scheme names and stuff .
37207	0	a	Yeah .
37208	0	a	No , , are the plates interchangeable ?
37209	0	a	I think I missed a few
37210	0	a	they are ?
37211	0	a	So you can have banana and kiwi and
37212	0	a	okay .
37213	0	a	Yeah .
37214	0	a	Yeah .
37215	0	a	Yeah .
37216	0	a	Yeah .
37217	0	a	Yeah .
37218	0	a	Yeah .
37219	0	a	Yeah .
37220	0	a	Okay , so that is something that is kind of in the making too ,
37221	0	a	like maybe it will become more
37222	0	a	That is fashionable in itself to have interchangeable plates .
37223	0	a	It is .
37224	0	a	I think
37225	0	a	w
37226	0	a	yeah ,
37227	0	a	I think one .
37228	0	a	Well that was our brief and we followed the brief .
37229	0	a	Well we have not got a big banana but
37230	0	a	Oh yeah .
37231	0	a	The thing is , I think if somebody saw that
37232	0	a	and you said what was that inspired from , I do not know if you would instantly say mango .
37233	0	a	Be like
37234	0	a	Yeah .
37235	0	a	No .
37236	0	a	No .
37237	0	a	Maybe if it was scented .
37238	0	a	Oh yeah .
37239	0	a	Oh that would be class .
37240	0	a	There we go .
37241	0	a	That would be great .
37242	0	a	Yeah we have money for that .
37243	0	a	Alright so based on this evaluation , do we average them out sorta thing ?
37244	0	a	Oh .
37245	0	a	Okay .
37246	0	a	Yes we do .
37247	0	a	So I wh what was I going to put for that ?
37248	0	a	A two for fashion ?
37249	0	a	Okay , so our average there , five , six , eight , ten , eleven , twelve , thirteen , fifteen ,
37250	0	a	nineteen , twenty one , divided by eleven
37251	0	a	is
37252	0	a	Between
37253	0	a	okay .
37254	0	a	I would say two .
37255	0	a	Yeah .
37256	0	a	Two .
37257	0	a	It is
37258	0	a	Yeah .
37259	0	a	One point nine or something ?
37260	0	a	I do not know these things .
37261	0	a	It is
37262	0	a	Between one and two .
37263	0	a	, between one and two .
37264	0	a	So that is pretty fantastic .
37265	0	a	Close to two .
37266	0	a	Yeah .
37267	0	a	Yeah , that is very good cause the highest we coulda got is one .
37268	0	a	I got
37269	0	a	Yeah , cause we have a four to bring down .
37270	0	a	Alright .
37271	0	a	Does that seem right then ?
37272	0	a	Okay .
37273	0	a	It seems like it should be more around two .
37274	0	a	, aye .
37275	0	a	Yeah .
37276	0	a	Yeah .
37277	0	a	, should have added five .
37278	0	a	Do we have an online calculator ?
37279	0	a	Okay .
37280	1	a	I am attempting to do that right now .
37281	0	a	This is .
37282	0	a	Yeah it is one point nine .
37283	0	a	Ooh .
37284	0	a	Yay .
37285	0	a	Oh wow .
37286	0	a	Well done .
37287	0	a	Go Heather Pauls .
37288	0	a	Well that is excellent .
37289	0	a	Yeah .
37290	0	a	Alright , now with that over and done with , our next step is to see if we are under budget .
37291	0	a	And my computer is frozen .
37292	0	a	And now it is not .
37293	0	a	Okay .
37294	0	a	So
37295	0	a	in our shared folder ,
37296	1	a	if everyone could go there right now ,
37297	1	a	I am going to steal a cable .
37298	0	a	Sorry .
37299	0	a	Are you going to do that ?
37300	0	a	Okay .
37301	0	a	it is it is
37302	0	a	it is an Excel file .
37303	0	a	Is that the project document ?
37304	0	a	Yeah .
37305	0	a	Oh .
37306	0	a	Production costs .
37307	0	a	Yeah .
37308	0	a	Kay there we go .
37309	0	a	, production costs .
37310	1	a	And I have to access that as well .
37311	0	a	It says it
37312	0	a	I think it just means that we ca not add any more to it now .
37313	0	a	One moment .
37314	0	a	Kay so far I have added what I think
37315	0	a	or what is going on ?
37316	0	a	Great .
37317	0	a	It is blinking at me .
37318	0	a	It is locked for editing .
37319	0	a	Read only .
37320	1	a	I am going to open up a second one then cause it is locked for editing .
37321	0	a	I have the original in my my email account .
37322	0	a	Oh is it locked cause I am in it ?
37323	0	a	Or
37324	0	a	okay .
37325	0	a	I dunno .
37326	0	a	Have you have you completed it ?
37327	0	a	Oh right .
37328	0	a	No .
37329	0	a	No , I was hoping that you guys could .
37330	0	a	Okay .
37331	0	a	Okay .
37332	0	a	, there we go .
37333	0	a	Okay here we go .
37334	1	a	So we need to tally up how much our w our product will be costing .
37335	1	a	So if you can look up at the screen ,
37336	0	a	the large screen ,
37337	1	a	oh I guess looking at your own too and telling me which one you think .
37338	0	a	Yeah .
37339	0	a	Okay we are using kinetic which is quite a large expense at three Euros .
37340	0	a	Yeah .
37341	0	a	Oh right .
37342	0	a	we are using a regular chip .
37343	0	a	Yeah .
37344	0	a	, it is cur it is double curved , so its curved all around .
37345	0	a	Double
37346	0	a	double curved
37347	0	a	yeah .
37348	0	a	That is another three .
37349	0	a	We are already at five .
37350	0	a	, we are using plastic and rubber ,
37351	0	a	so
37352	0	a	Good thing plastic is free ,
37353	0	a	we are at eight .
37354	0	a	Yeah .
37355	0	a	S
37356	0	a	Yeah .
37357	0	a	What about a special colour ?
37358	0	a	Are we using that ?
37359	0	a	Yeah .
37360	1	a	I guess we should do it just for one kind .
37361	0	a	Yeah .
37362	0	a	So it is like special colour
37363	0	a	well we will have two colours
37364	0	a	right ?
37365	0	a	Well one colour for the case , one colour for the buttons .
37366	0	a	Yeah .
37367	0	a	So we can
37368	0	a	, we have push button interface , so that is inexpensive .
37369	0	a	And we have a special colour for the button , and we also have a special form .
37370	0	a	And a special material .
37371	0	a	And a special material .
37372	0	a	Yeah .
37373	0	a	Oof .
37374	0	a	Which puts us just barely under budget .
37375	0	a	Hurray .
37376	0	a	Congratulations guys .
37377	0	a	Is good .
37378	0	a	Yeah .
37379	0	a	Good work guys .
37380	0	a	So our operating cost is twelve twenty Euros .
37381	0	a	That is good .
37382	0	a	Awesome .
37383	0	a	And back to our PowerPoint .
37384	0	a	So we have
37385	0	a	Kay .
37386	0	a	Yes we are .
37387	0	a	So we need to do a product evaluation , again , which is probably I dunno .
37388	0	a	A different extension of a
37389	0	a	Of the actual project rather than the product ?
37390	0	a	A project ?
37391	0	a	Is is
37392	0	a	yeah .
37393	0	a	Yeah .
37394	0	a	Yeah cause we are talking about leadership , teamwork .
37395	0	a	So wh how we actually went round about doing it .
37396	0	a	Yeah .
37397	0	a	Alright
37398	0	a	so
37399	0	a	Do you guys feel like there was room for creativity ?
37400	0	a	Pushed for creativity ?
37401	0	a	Okay .
37402	0	a	I think we were pushed .
37403	0	a	I mean we were not really given a lot of time , or materials ,
37404	0	a	yeah ,
37405	0	a	to go about our design task .
37406	0	a	The ma
37407	0	a	Or materials .
37408	0	a	Yeah .
37409	0	a	So I think we could have done with a bit more time .
37410	0	a	So it would be like need more time and materials .
37411	0	a	Yeah .
37412	0	a	But you were allowed m creativity ?
37413	0	a	I think so as like
37414	0	a	but you were supposed to have creativ
37415	0	a	Right .
37416	0	a	Yeah .
37417	0	a	Yeah
37418	0	a	and the conceptual and functional .
37419	0	a	Like we were very creative in in coming up with an idea I guess , but m
37420	0	a	When we can down to it .
37421	0	a	Yeah .
37422	0	a	Yeah .
37423	0	a	Well we were just limited by resources really
37424	0	a	and like if we had decided to use the LCD screen , and like solar power backup and everything , then we would not have been able to afford that .
37425	0	a	Yeah .
37426	0	a	Okay .
37427	0	a	So that did limit creativity .
37428	0	a	Creativity .
37429	0	a	Right
37430	0	a	Okay Great .
37431	0	a	Just resources .
37432	0	a	But yeah .
37433	0	a	The fruit and veg idea .
37434	0	a	Leadership ?
37435	0	a	Is this me being like , guys do you like me ? .
37436	0	a	Yeah .
37437	0	a	Good leadership , I think we stayed on task .
37438	0	a	Yeah .
37439	0	a	Yeah we did .
37440	0	a	Yeah .
37441	0	a	We have ,
37442	0	a	seeing as we have come out with what we intended .
37443	0	a	A pro a product within the budget .
37444	0	a	I think that is a sign of good leadership and also our personal coach helped us along the way ,
37445	0	a	so you know
37446	0	a	I think it is been fine .
37447	0	a	Yeah .
37448	0	a	And the timing was good .
37449	0	a	We never were pushed for time , or sat around doing nothing , so Was good teamwork .
37450	0	a	Yeah .
37451	0	a	Yeah .
37452	0	a	Good timing .
37453	0	a	Oop
37454	0	a	Okay .
37455	0	a	And project manager of course .
37456	0	a	Teamwork ?
37457	0	a	I think we worked great as a team .
37458	0	a	Yeah .
37459	0	a	Yeah ?
37460	0	a	Alright how were our means ?
37461	0	a	We needed more Play Doh colours .
37462	0	a	Yeah .
37463	0	a	I think we are well suited to our roles .
37464	0	a	Yeah .
37465	0	a	Yeah .
37466	0	a	Yeah and more Play Doh ,
37467	0	a	cause that was all the red we had .
37468	0	a	Yeah .
37469	0	a	Yeah .
37470	0	a	So even if we wanted to make a bigger prototype , we would not have been able to .
37471	0	a	Yeah , it c it might have been bigger .
37472	0	a	Oh really ?
37473	0	a	Okay .
37474	0	a	But ever everything else was satisfactory ?
37475	0	a	Is that good
37476	0	a	Yeah ?
37477	0	a	New ideas found .
37478	0	a	Yeah .
37479	0	a	The computer programmes are good .
37480	0	a	Yeah .
37481	0	a	The
37482	0	a	Yeah .
37483	0	a	Yeah .
37484	0	a	It could be really straightforward for the computer .
37485	0	a	I do not think there was anything
37486	0	a	Yeah .
37487	0	a	I think the only thing was having to remember to you know to tick the okays
37488	0	a	but I think I was the only one who struggled with that .
37489	0	a	I am actually not sure if I have saved my presentations .
37490	0	a	They will probably still be there .
37491	0	a	me too .
37492	0	a	Yeah .
37493	0	a	I do not really know what that means .
37494	0	a	I am not sure , new ideas found .
37495	0	a	Well I think we have all learnt stuff from each other ,
37496	0	a	like the
37497	0	a	n
37498	0	a	yeah .
37499	0	a	Yeah .
37500	0	a	Through discussion .
37501	0	a	Just about each different .
37502	0	a	Got new ideas from each other .
37503	0	a	Yeah .
37504	0	a	Yeah well I guess we really it
37505	0	a	we bounced off of each other , which was cool .
37506	0	a	Yeah .
37507	0	a	Like based on marketing stuff
37508	0	a	and then you would say something about interface and
37509	0	a	yeah , worked well .
37510	0	a	Yeah .
37511	0	a	Yeah .
37512	0	a	And we were a able to modify each other is ideas to fit in with our areas of expertise .
37513	0	a	Yeah .
37514	0	a	Yeah .
37515	0	a	Each other is
37516	0	a	Oh does it have smart materials by the way ?
37517	0	a	Does it have smart materials ?
37518	0	a	Oh yeah .
37519	0	a	Sorry ?
37520	0	a	Oh yeah .
37521	0	a	Well , did it come into the into
37522	0	a	I dunno if we counted that in the costs .
37523	0	a	If if it if it
37524	0	a	If it can be afforded .
37525	0	a	Okay ?
37526	0	a	Well with that achieved , our last slide is our closing slide .
37527	0	a	Yes our costs are within budget .
37528	0	a	Yes .
37529	0	a	It is evaluated generally positively .
37530	0	a	Yeah .
37531	0	a	And do not forget to complete final questionnaire and meeting summary .
37532	0	a	Then we celebrate in such a way that I have no idea .
37533	0	a	Yay .
37534	0	a	Fantastic .
37535	0	a	By watching TV ?
37536	0	a	Okay , brilliant .
37537	0	a	Alright ?
37538	0	a	 
37539	0	a	Okay .
37540	0	a	Oh , that is not going to work .
37541	0	a	Oh , alright .
37542	0	a	Okay .
37543	0	a	Okay .
37544	0	a	alright .
37545	0	a	I will just put that there .
37546	0	a	as you all know we are here to create a brand new fantastic remote .
37547	0	a	I am Nick Debusk , I am the Project Manager .
37548	1	a	we will just get started with everyone kind of letting each other know who they are and what you are doing , what your what your role is .
37549	1	a	Go ahead .
37550	0	a	Okay .
37551	0	a	I am Corinne Whiting and I will be the Marketing Expert and in each of the three phases I will have a different role .
37552	0	a	In the function design phase I will be talking about user requirement specification , and this means what needs and desires are to be fulfilled , and I will be doing research to figure this out .
37553	0	a	In the conceptual design phase I will be dealing with trend watching and I will be doing marketing research on the web .
37554	0	a	And then finally in the detailed design phase I will be doing product evaluation
37555	0	a	and so I will be collecting the requirements and ranking all the requirements to see how we did .
37556	1	a	Kay .
37557	0	a	Hiya
37558	0	a	, I am Ryan .
37559	0	a	I am the User Interface Designer .
37560	0	a	likewise I have three different roles for each stage of design .
37561	0	a	the functional design is looking at the tex technical functions of a remote control .
37562	0	a	in the concept design , the user interface , how the user reacts with the the product .
37563	0	a	And the detailed design sort of like the user interface design , what they might be looking for , things like fashions ,
37564	0	a	what makes wha
37565	0	a	how we are going to make it special .
37566	0	a	That is about it .
37567	0	a	Right .
37568	0	a	I am Manuel and I am the Industrial Designer in in this project .
37569	0	a	In the functional design phase I am I will be dealing mostly with the requirements , we will discuss what the prog what functions the the product has to fulfil and so and so on .
37570	1	a	I suppose we will work pretty much together on that one .
37571	0	a	in the conceptual design I will be pro mostly dealing with properties and materials of our product .
37572	0	a	Yeah .
37573	0	a	And the detailed design in the detailed design I will be concerned with the look and feel of the product itself , so we are pretty much working together obviously on the design front here .
37574	0	a	Okay .
37575	0	a	Okay .
37576	0	a	so
37577	0	a	we have got our opening , our our agenda is the opening , acquaintance which we have kind of done .
37578	0	a	tool training , project plan discussion and then closing .
37579	0	a	grand total of twenty five minutes we have here .
37580	0	a	so
37581	0	a	we are putting together a new remote control .
37582	0	a	we want it to be something original .
37583	0	a	of course we are a not only a electronics company but a fashion conscious electronics company , so we want it to be trendy and we want it to be easy to use .
37584	0	a	we have got the functional design , conceptual design and detailed design which basically is is the three of you .
37585	0	a	And w well
37586	0	a	functional design .
37587	0	a	do we have any ideas of of maybe d
37588	1	a	let is just throw out some ideas of what kind of remote control we want to have , and then we can go into how we are going to design it and and how we are going to do the detailing on it .
37589	0	a	Yeah .
37590	0	a	Well
37591	0	a	s
37592	0	a	function of remote control is just just
37593	0	a	you know ,
37594	0	a	change channels is its main function .
37595	0	a	So
37596	0	a	we want it to be a TV remote
37597	0	a	or I I mean do we want it to to do other things besides just be a a television remote ?
37598	0	a	Kay .
37599	0	a	Oh right .
37600	1	a	I suppose you c try make it a universal remote
37601	0	a	for
37602	1	a	could work on all sort of electrical products in in one person is house .
37603	0	a	But , you know , they all sorta have the same role changing channels , volumes and then programming .
37604	0	a	Kay .
37605	0	a	I think they all work on the same prin principle as well
37606	0	a	sorta like
37607	0	a	I do not actually know .
37608	0	a	But is it just infra red ?
37609	0	a	Is that standard ?
37610	0	a	yeah .
37611	0	a	I I think yeah ,
37612	0	a	yeah , r universal remote .
37613	0	a	this is my first go round with creating a remote control ,
37614	0	a	so
37615	0	a	I think we are all in the same boat here .
37616	0	a	Huh .
37617	0	a	Ours too .
37618	0	a	Okay .
37619	0	a	one thing I thought of with the remote control is you always lose them .
37620	0	a	So if there is a g a way of finding it quite easily , I thought that would be quite good quite a good feature .
37621	0	a	Ch
37622	1	a	Like a tracking device ?
37623	1	a	So we should we should set our remote control up to where it has a like a tracking device
37624	0	a	or or like a a
37625	1	a	It makes a noise , there is a button on the TV that you press
37626	0	a	and
37627	0	a	Kay .
37628	0	a	Oh you can get those key
37629	0	a	well
37630	1	a	you could whistle or make a noise and it would beep .
37631	0	a	Yeah .
37632	0	a	Right .
37633	0	a	Be good .
37634	0	a	So
37635	0	a	Generally , all remotes are sort of quite similar in their appearance .
37636	0	a	Yeah .
37637	0	a	Just long .
37638	0	a	Do we want
37639	0	a	so they are kind of like long and rectangular .
37640	0	a	Yeah .
37641	0	a	Do we want something crazy ?
37642	0	a	You know ,
37643	0	a	we want something new that is going to stand out .
37644	0	a	Black usually .
37645	0	a	Yeah .
37646	1	a	Lot more modern .
37647	0	a	I think so .
37648	0	a	A m a modern so our remote should be
37649	0	a	Kay .
37650	1	a	Maybe sorta spherical or something .
37651	1	a	A ball .
37652	1	a	Maybe like user friendly ,
37653	0	a	like a little
37654	0	a	you know ,
37655	1	a	where you can use both hands , like a little keyboard type thing .
37656	0	a	Yeah .
37657	0	a	People
37658	0	a	I thought maybe , because people always tend to throw a remote control about the place to one another
37659	1	a	if it was in a ball , and maybe the actual controls are inside or something .
37660	0	a	Well
37661	0	a	there are of course certain restrictions , you ca not have it be any form and fulfil all functions at the same time , so there are always the some restrictions
37662	1	a	we have to apply here .
37663	0	a	Yeah .
37664	1	a	however one question is how stable is that thing supposed to be ,
37665	0	a	that refers to the material , pretty much .
37666	1	a	What are we going to build that thing out of ?
37667	1	a	How sturdy is it going to be ?
37668	0	a	Do we want it to last longer or rather have people whatever , have to buy one every half a year ?
37669	0	a	Right .
37670	0	a	Okay so
37671	0	a	yeah ,
37672	1	a	so we want it to be sturdy , we want it to to hold up to somebody is child , you know , throwing it across the room
37673	0	a	or , as you said , people kind of throw it ,
37674	1	a	so ball shaped , you know , if it were ball shaped maybe ,
37675	0	a	then it
37676	0	a	Kay .
37677	0	a	Yeah .
37678	0	a	Yeah .
37679	1	a	It could be cased on the outside and t everything could be inside .
37680	0	a	so
37681	1	a	we want it to be modern , fun , sturdy ,
37682	0	a	So our form and our function .
37683	1	a	we want it to be easy to find .
37684	0	a	What else it what else do we want it to to do ?
37685	0	a	So we want it to be universal .
37686	0	a	It is something that we are supposed to sell for about twenty five Euros
37687	0	a	and you know ,
37688	0	a	goals for profits are I think somewhere around fifty million Euros , what they want to make on it , so .
37689	0	a	Also since we are partners of the International Remote Control Association ,
37690	1	a	maybe we want to make it something that would globally appeal .
37691	0	a	Kay .
37692	0	a	That is more on the research end , but the marketing .
37693	0	a	So marketing ,
37694	0	a	you know ,
37695	0	a	how maybe
37696	1	a	marketing , you could s find out what is the most universally appealing remote control out there .
37697	0	a	Yeah .
37698	1	a	And maybe as far as design goes , maybe we could have different ones for different target audiences ,
37699	0	a	cause maybe one wo not apply to all of the countries we are targeting .
37700	0	a	Kay .
37701	0	a	Small .
37702	1	a	Do you guys have any ideas for what it should look like ?
37703	1	a	Maybe we could draw it up on the on the board over there .
37704	1	a	Some ideas ?
37705	1	a	We want it to be a b a ball ,
37706	0	a	you know ,
37707	1	a	we will draw up we will draw up the ball and maybe th where the buttons are located .
37708	0	a	I would
37709	1	a	I could draw sorta the ball idea .
37710	0	a	My original idea was just simply sort of a sphere ,
37711	0	a	where maybe you
37712	1	a	this is where it is connected together , and then when you open it out , it could fol it could be maybe flip , like a flip phone ,
37713	0	a	and then when you fold it out the middle
37714	1	a	Maybe a hinge that will have to be the strongest part of it .
37715	0	a	If that if we did use a hinge , or if it was just two parts ,
37716	1	a	and then you would have just sorta you you you know , your buttons .
37717	0	a	Thing is inside
37718	0	a	I think , sometimes remotes have too many buttons ,
37719	1	a	so maybe as simple as possible , as few buttons inside as possible .
37720	0	a	, I dunno , what is the idea for .
37721	0	a	Just something maybe if you ha
37722	1	a	if it had like if some kind of like light or something or lights around it .
37723	0	a	It is looking a bit like something out of Star Wars at the moment though , to be fair .
37724	0	a	But yeah .
37725	0	a	Futuristic .
37726	0	a	That was that was a sorta simple idea I had
37727	0	a	and then you know you could about
37728	0	a	Right ,
37729	0	a	it would almost be like a ball .
37730	0	a	Uh huh .
37731	0	a	So that was just just an idea I had .
37732	1	a	I do not know whether anybody else has other ideas ?
37733	0	a	Yeah .
37734	0	a	Right .
37735	0	a	One problem you would get with this design is
37736	0	a	the ball is a nice idea
37737	0	a	because of it is stability really , but of course , since it is a ball ,
37738	0	a	it will roll ,
37739	1	a	so we would have to have it flat on one side at least , down here somewhere , take away that part .
37740	0	a	Yeah .
37741	0	a	Maybe f yeah .
37742	0	a	That is one of the big issues .
37743	0	a	Yeah , that is g that is a good idea .
37744	0	a	Also also you risk the hinges here .
37745	0	a	Yeah .
37746	0	a	That is that is a problem .
37747	0	a	The idea
37748	1	a	it did not have to necessarily be f a hinge ,
37749	0	a	that was just one idea though .
37750	0	a	That is that is interesting of course , but that is of course a weak point , yeah .
37751	0	a	Yeah .
37752	1	a	How would we go about making you know getting rid of our weak points ?
37753	0	a	What
37754	0	a	I mean would we just have a flat spot on the bottom of the ball ?
37755	0	a	Not to put you on the spot ,
37756	0	a	but
37757	0	a	What did you say your title was again ?
37758	0	a	You are the the Industrial Designer .
37759	0	a	E
37760	0	a	No no ,
37761	0	a	N n
37762	0	a	, I am your Industrial Designer ,
37763	0	a	so i b well ,
37764	0	a	the point is that
37765	0	a	well
37766	0	a	maybe I dunno .
37767	0	a	The shape is perhaps not the most ideal .
37768	0	a	Okay .
37769	0	a	As as stable as it is ,
37770	1	a	there must be a compromise between stability and design here , so .
37771	0	a	Well
37772	0	a	I I suppose that things become design .
37773	0	a	But I mean i
37774	0	a	I was trying to think of like the design of others .
37775	0	a	I ca not think of anything other than a long rectangle for remote , maybe small , sort of fatter ones , but there is nothing being done sort of out of left field , yeah .
37776	0	a	Yeah .
37777	0	a	It is not new , it is not innovative ,
37778	0	a	it is you know ,
37779	0	a	everybody does long remote because it is easy , it is it is stable .
37780	0	a	Yeah .
37781	0	a	Kay ,
37782	1	a	I will draw something .
37783	0	a	So if
37784	0	a	no ,
37785	1	a	go ahead .
37786	0	a	What ?
37787	1	a	My idea was just to have it be kind of like a keyboard type shape , you know , like video games
37788	0	a	l so .
37789	0	a	Yeah .
37790	0	a	But maybe
37791	0	a	I mean that would be kind of big and bulky .
37792	1	a	We could also try to do the hinge thing , so it could like flip out that way .
37793	0	a	I do not know .
37794	0	a	That is my idea .
37795	0	a	I think definitely doing something different is a good idea .
37796	0	a	Yeah .
37797	0	a	I mean maybe design something ,
37798	0	a	that is sort of like
37799	0	a	suppose not everybody is everybody is hand is the same ,
37800	1	a	but something that would maybe fit in the hand easier .
37801	1	a	Something with a grip .
37802	0	a	Yeah , with a grip .
37803	0	a	Yeah .
37804	0	a	Yeah .
37805	0	a	Because even I suppose even with the ball
37806	0	a	it is
37807	0	a	it might not be the easiest to hold onto .
37808	0	a	It still might be hard to
37809	0	a	it still not the ho easiest thing to hold , yeah .
37810	0	a	So perhaps the the joystick the the keyboard idea might work better .
37811	0	a	Like yeah .
37812	0	a	But then again , people like to use one hand to flip and one hand to hold their soda ,
37813	0	a	so maybe maybe we
37814	0	a	I feel like I am just shooting everything down here .
37815	0	a	Yeah .
37816	0	a	True .
37817	0	a	It is d
37818	0	a	yeah .
37819	1	a	I think it is definitely got to be a a one handed a one handed job .
37820	0	a	Yeah .
37821	0	a	That is fine .
37822	0	a	You are the boss ,
37823	0	a	you are allowed to .
37824	0	a	Well
37825	0	a	with the one handed design you also have the the problem of the size
37826	0	a	w
37827	0	a	cause you know from cell phones , they can be too small .
37828	0	a	So if the remote is too small it
37829	0	a	if it is small it probably looks better , but may not be th as functional .
37830	0	a	Yeah .
37831	0	a	So for that there is So
37832	0	a	The question is also , I dunno , d do you really always want to open that thing when you have to use it ?
37833	0	a	It is probably going to lie around opened all the time anyway ,
37834	0	a	so I do not know if a lid is a good idea .
37835	0	a	Okay , so
37836	1	a	unfortunately we have got about five minutes here to come up with our remote control idea and start rolling with it .
37837	0	a	we have talked about our experiences with remote control and we have got a couple ideas .
37838	0	a	Let is see here .
37839	0	a	What if we had what if we had not only
37840	1	a	say we went with the ball the ball function , but maybe we give it sort of grips along the side s
37841	0	a	to make it easier to hold on to .
37842	0	a	So you know s
37843	0	a	so
37844	0	a	it is easier to hold onto that way .
37845	0	a	Yeah .
37846	0	a	Course that will then remove some of our our ball .
37847	0	a	Unless this unless this part were raised ,
37848	0	a	so
37849	1	a	say the cover flips over and covers that part .
37850	0	a	So the grip is
37851	0	a	No , that would not work either .
37852	0	a	But if we are going to make it flat on the bottom , then that eliminates our ball anyways .
37853	1	a	So if it were flat on the bottom and then had the sorta grips on the side here I guess ,
37854	0	a	and then flat
37855	0	a	And then we have the problem with the hinge .
37856	0	a	So if we are flat on the bottom , it is not going to roll away , it will stay where we want .
37857	0	a	, that is true .
37858	0	a	From stabil stability point of view it certainly is ,
37859	0	a	but also you have to face it and take into account the more of these things break by accident , the more we sell .
37860	0	a	So
37861	0	a	it is
37862	1	a	do not make it too stable .
37863	0	a	So
37864	1	a	we do not have it flip open .
37865	1	a	We just have a ball
37866	0	a	Okay ,
37867	1	a	so then we forget the ball .
37868	1	a	But then maybe to go back to the to th s something along those things then .
37869	1	a	To the other design .
37870	0	a	It looks cool .
37871	0	a	Looks cool though .
37872	0	a	It looks cool , but it is really not it is not functional .
37873	0	a	Yeah .
37874	0	a	functional .
37875	0	a	So we have got our sort of keyboard kind .
37876	1	a	What if we flipped it around here ,
37877	0	a	so that it were
37878	0	a	Sorry ,
37879	0	a	that does not look anything like what you had there .
37880	0	a	so
37881	0	a	it is up and down , you hold it this way .
37882	0	a	Course then it is it is like the rectangular again , only with a couple of jutting out points .
37883	0	a	Yeah .
37884	0	a	Right .
37885	0	a	Right .
37886	0	a	But it is one handed .
37887	0	a	Question is what makes those game pads functional ?
37888	0	a	W
37889	0	a	I think that is pretty much the form for full hand .
37890	0	a	So it is a round shape underneath that makes it comfy ,
37891	0	a	right ,
37892	0	a	makes it nice ,
37893	0	a	so that is the essential part .
37894	0	a	Yeah .
37895	0	a	Except for that I think we will not probably not get a get away from some longer design .
37896	0	a	Yeah .
37897	0	a	Right .
37898	0	a	Cause you also have to know which way around to point this thing .
37899	0	a	Yeah ,
37900	0	a	because it does not have a cord , like joysticks do .
37901	0	a	You know , all
37902	0	a	that dif batteries
37903	0	a	right ,
37904	0	a	and Batteries go weak as well ,
37905	0	a	so
37906	0	a	after a while you have to point it towards the towards the equipment you want to control with it ,
37907	0	a	right ?
37908	1	a	So , have to m show which is the front , which is the back .
37909	0	a	Is it possible to have it to where it would work with a like a sensor on either side ?
37910	0	a	So that either way you are pointing it it would work .
37911	0	a	I suppose you could do that .
37912	0	a	O of course the more technology you stick in that , the more it will cost , so .
37913	0	a	More expensive and yeah .
37914	0	a	Course you can do that .
37915	0	a	Kay .
37916	0	a	True .
37917	0	a	I mean of course it will be evident after a while or
37918	0	a	if you look at it , it will it will be evident which way around to point it , since you have the the numbers and the and the the buttons and stuff , but it is rather about an instinctual thing , like you just grab it
37919	0	a	, you do not have to s look at it ,
37920	0	a	you know ,
37921	0	a	which way around to point it .
37922	0	a	Put it
37923	1	a	Even if you designed it in some in a way that you know , is not a rectangle , but still pointed in a direction that had definite points .
37924	0	a	Otherwise the design of or the the point of putting two sensors on both sides would probably work .
37925	0	a	So if that is your thing and you got something like that instead ,
37926	0	a	and there is your s
37927	0	a	you kn
37928	0	a	you know which way you are going to pointing it .
37929	0	a	Yeah .
37930	0	a	Kay .
37931	0	a	Sorry to interrupt ,
37932	0	a	but we have a warning to finish .
37933	0	a	Does it say what does it say for n
37934	0	a	it says on there what we need to do for the next meeting , I think .
37935	0	a	Are we out of time ?
37936	0	a	Okay , well ,
37937	1	a	just to finish up ,
37938	0	a	should we s go with this plan ,
37939	0	a	start making some Are good ideas , what are not .
37940	0	a	Yeah .
37941	0	a	Let is .
37942	0	a	Obviously
37943	1	a	Must finish now , so .
37944	0	a	And then marketing will look and see what what people want .
37945	0	a	Okay .
37946	0	a	And Project Manager will design a better meeting for next time around ,
37947	1	a	be a little bit more prepared .
37948	0	a	And alright ,
37949	0	a	 
37950	0	a	Oh .
37951	0	a	Du we yes s
37952	0	a	I have lo
37953	0	a	I have done the role that I was asked to do anyway .
37954	0	a	Okay .
37955	0	a	Thanks for coming to this meeting .
37956	0	a	Hm .
37957	0	a	S
37958	0	a	how we doing on our remote ?
37959	0	a	We have some we have some ideas and some ideas for what people want .
37960	0	a	Yeah .
37961	0	a	I think .
37962	0	a	Alright
37963	1	a	let is just go over the agenda real quick for this meeting .
37964	1	a	See if I ca not get things moving along here a little bit better .
37965	1	a	I will go over what we went over last time ,
37966	0	a	which should not take long .
37967	0	a	Then I believe each of you have a presentation .
37968	0	a	I have was sent a a couple more requirements for our remote , what they want .
37969	0	a	then we can come to a conclusion on what we want the remote to do , and how it is going to do it hopefully .
37970	0	a	And then we will have the closing .
37971	0	a	which we will have forty minutes for .
37972	0	a	let is see ,
37973	0	a	the last meeting we went over who was responsible for what .
37974	0	a	I am responsible for leading the meetings , keeping the notes , and coming up with the final presentation .
37975	0	a	Corinne is our Marketing Expert .
37976	0	a	She is going to figure out what what the consumer wants .
37977	0	a	Ryan is our User Interface Designer .
37978	0	a	And Manuel is the Industrial Designer .
37979	1	a	So you are going to come up with the ideas Ryan , and you are going to pick them apart .
37980	0	a	we decided our remote ,
37981	0	a	we want it to be a universal remote that everyone would want .
37982	0	a	we want to be modern , fun , different .
37983	0	a	it needs to be sturdy , easy to find , so we going to have that locator function .
37984	0	a	and we want to be different .
37985	0	a	and then we went over a couple of different ideas .
37986	0	a	Ball shaped phone .
37987	0	a	The keyboard shape .
37988	0	a	we decided that it should probably be one handed .
37989	0	a	Something we could use with one hand .
37990	0	a	and that was our last meeting .
37991	0	a	So
37992	0	a	why do not
37993	0	a	Do each of you have a presentation ?
37994	0	a	Okay .
37995	0	a	Yep .
37996	1	a	I will hand it off to you
37997	0	a	and
37998	0	a	Does anyone
37999	0	a	do you want to go first ?
38000	0	a	So we can maybe see what what the people want .
38001	0	a	Sure .
38002	0	a	What was it ?
38003	0	a	Function ?
38004	0	a	F eight ?
38005	0	a	Well .
38006	0	a	Eight .
38007	0	a	F eight .
38008	1	a	How do I get it
38009	0	a	Oh right right right .
38010	1	a	Slide show .
38011	0	a	To go to the next one ?
38012	0	a	Yeah
38013	1	a	you click on that guy .
38014	0	a	That one ?
38015	0	a	Okay .
38016	0	a	Yeah .
38017	0	a	Alright .
38018	0	a	Well ,
38019	0	a	this is my report , which is going to be based pretty much on a survey that I was sent .
38020	0	a	Oh gosh ,
38021	0	a	I have no idea .
38022	0	a	G
38023	0	a	Okay .
38024	1	a	Just press the arrow keys I think .
38025	0	a	Usually goes to it .
38026	0	a	Sorry
38027	0	a	I actually need to see something else on my screen .
38028	1	a	Hit F eight again .
38029	0	a	Yeah .
38030	0	a	I think .
38031	1	a	And then ?
38032	0	a	Again ?
38033	0	a	No
38034	0	a	I want something else on mine .
38035	0	a	Yeah .
38036	0	a	You want it to be on both screens , or just just yours ?
38037	0	a	Yeah
38038	1	a	but I think you have to hit escape .
38039	0	a	Is that possible ?
38040	0	a	Okay
38041	0	a	but now you do not have that .
38042	0	a	And then you can
38043	0	a	Yeah .
38044	0	a	Oh
38045	1	a	hit F eight again .
38046	0	a	Sorry guys .
38047	0	a	I know .
38048	0	a	I did the same thing .
38049	0	a	And then it should come up here shortly .
38050	0	a	Kay .
38051	0	a	So
38052	0	a	is there no way I can give you the slideshow and
38053	0	a	yeah .
38054	0	a	I think
38055	0	a	oh give us the slideshow and something on your screen ?
38056	0	a	Yeah .
38057	0	a	Oh well .
38058	0	a	I am not sure .
38059	1	a	You could maybe minimise that screen and then have them both up at the same time I think .
38060	0	a	Yeah .
38061	0	a	It is okay .
38062	0	a	Okay .
38063	0	a	so
38064	0	a	first of all , the method that I used was by doing some marketing research , by doing research on some interviews that were conducted .
38065	0	a	And then some internet research .
38066	0	a	And I was sent a report
38067	0	a	that was
38068	0	a	I think there were a hundred remote users that they interviewed .
38069	1	a	And so I will show you some of the results from that ,
38070	0	a	which I think will be helpful .
38071	0	a	okay
38072	0	a	here are some of the findings .
38073	0	a	They said that the users dislike the look and feel of their current remote controls .
38074	0	a	And seventy five percent of the users find their remote controls to be ugly .
38075	0	a	Which is a fairly significant number I would say .
38076	0	a	And eighty percent of the users would be willing to spend more money if they could get a remote that would look fancy .
38077	0	a	So I think that earlier we were onto something when we were talking about having it be a modern cool look ,
38078	0	a	I think that is definitely important .
38079	0	a	they say that current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour of the user .
38080	0	a	Seventy five percent of users said they zap a lot .
38081	0	a	And if anyone could clarify what that means ?
38082	0	a	Zap , does that just mean like changing the channel ?
38083	0	a	Okay .
38084	0	a	Is is it j just just
38085	0	a	just using it yeah .
38086	0	a	Just jus
38087	0	a	yeah .
38088	0	a	and fifty percent of the users say that they are only using ten percent of the buttons on their remote control .
38089	0	a	And there was something else , they kept track of the frequency per hour in using certain buttons .
38090	1	a	And some of them it looks like barely need to be included at all .
38091	0	a	Of course channel selection is used the most frequently .
38092	0	a	And then teletext was the next .
38093	0	a	Volume and then power .
38094	0	a	And then audio settings and screen settings and channel settings were practically never used .
38095	0	a	So
38096	1	a	I think we could definitely eliminate or somehow combine a lot of the functions into one button .
38097	0	a	the biggest user frustrations , as we said fifty percent of people find that their remotes are lost somewhere ,
38098	0	a	and so I think a tracking device of some sort would be a good idea .
38099	0	a	They said it take
38100	0	a	thirty four percent said it takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote .
38101	0	a	And twenty six percent said that the controls are bad for RSI .
38102	0	a	A repetitive strain injury .
38103	0	a	What is it ?
38104	0	a	Okay .
38105	0	a	Just repetitive strain injury .
38106	0	a	I think .
38107	0	a	That is what I guess .
38108	0	a	Okay .
38109	0	a	And so bas
38110	0	a	okay .
38111	0	a	as far as speech recognition goes , the younger group looks like they are all for it .
38112	0	a	From the fifteen to twenty five age group over ninety percent said they would pay more .
38113	0	a	And it kind of just went down incrementally .
38114	0	a	The groups at
38115	0	a	the older they get it looks like the less willing they are to pay ,
38116	1	a	so maybe we could discuss this and think and decide if we think it is worth investing in this .
38117	1	a	At least if we are targeting the younger groups .
38118	0	a	And so
38119	0	a	in conclusion .
38120	0	a	Some things that I drew from this are that I think we were correct .
38121	1	a	We definitely need to focus on a new modern appearance ,
38122	0	a	since so many people seem to be concerned about the ugliness of their remote control .
38123	1	a	a multifunctional remote could be a good thing to explore .
38124	0	a	So you only have one rather than five different remotes sitting all over your room .
38125	1	a	we need to simplify the remote and reduce the number of buttons , get rid of the ones that do not seem to be serving much purpose .
38126	1	a	And then lastly I thought that maybe we could discuss the idea of speech recognition .
38127	0	a	And that is it .
38128	0	a	Kay .
38129	0	a	Very nice .
38130	0	a	Now we actually have some ideas of what what people want , what we should focus on .
38131	1	a	Wait
38132	1	a	can I look at that real quick ? .
38133	0	a	Oh yeah .
38134	0	a	Sorry
38135	0	a	did you guys get time to write everything that you needed ?
38136	0	a	Kay .
38137	0	a	Yeah .
38138	0	a	Having just listened to what Corinne just said ,
38139	1	a	I will draw on some of the things as well .
38140	1	a	Some things that sort of relevant to what I want to say .
38141	0	a	Kay so
38142	1	a	I am just going to
38143	1	a	yeah
38144	1	a	approach the technical functions design .
38145	0	a	the method I used was to explore the technical functions of a remote control .
38146	0	a	And t s simplest approach that I came to is is to change , programme and operate an electronic device remotely .
38147	0	a	I mean that is an obvious thing to say ,
38148	0	a	but it is not attached to the device that you want to control .
38149	0	a	I had some things sent to me .
38150	0	a	Not very much .
38151	1	a	To look at similar devices .
38152	1	a	defined in some them .
38153	1	a	And then the personal preferences that I will suggest .
38154	0	a	we discussed a universal one .
38155	0	a	like
38156	0	a	it is just been brought up again then .
38157	0	a	But I think a universal remote control is actually quite a difficult object to design , and po possibly within maybe the budget that we do it ,
38158	0	a	because you would need to know all the spef specifications of a all the like electronic companies .
38159	0	a	I am not sure have you ever come across a universal remote control yourself ,
38160	0	a	but you have to i
38161	0	a	they are a nightmare to use .
38162	0	a	You have to set them , reset them to everything .
38163	0	a	and that would only add buttons .
38164	1	a	Whereas I think the aim is to take away buttons .
38165	1	a	So I think it would be better maybe to concentrate on maybe just a universal one for TVs .
38166	1	a	or maybe just one that you could we could design and then different people , manufacturers could use it to set to their specifications , if if the aim is to get something that is unique in design .
38167	0	a	Okay
38168	0	a	here here is just two pictures of remote controls .
38169	0	a	They are just simple TV remote controls .
38170	0	a	But one is user centred .
38171	0	a	That is the one on the left .
38172	0	a	And you can straight away see there is less buttons .
38173	0	a	And the other one is engineer centred where that is more specified for the sort of the elaborate piece of equipment it is trying to control
38174	1	a	which appeals more to the product that we want ,
38175	1	a	and on what the have said and the market research and stuff probably looking at something that should be user centred .
38176	1	a	Fewer buttons , simpler to use ,
38177	0	a	and if ten percent is hidden away
38178	0	a	if ten percent is what is used ,
38179	1	a	maybe the other fifty percent , the buttons that are used very rarely like programming , they could be hidden maybe
38180	0	a	under
38181	0	a	some remote controls you might have come across have maybe a little flip thi thing where they are hidden away .
38182	0	a	And the main buttons are the ones you or the ones you come across .
38183	0	a	and finally ,
38184	0	a	sort I have sort of covered that ,
38185	1	a	our product I think should be user interface orientated .
38186	1	a	Like I said to concentrate on TV remote control ,
38187	0	a	a universal remote might be too complex .
38188	0	a	and as what it ,
38189	0	a	the major findings market researchers have said , it is the image and the appearance that people di dislike .
38190	1	a	So that we should concentrate on something that would set a trend .
38191	0	a	And that is it .
38192	0	a	cable there .
38193	0	a	Thank you .
38194	0	a	What was your last conclusion on that one ?
38195	0	a	Focus on
38196	0	a	the i
38197	0	a	the image of it .
38198	0	a	On something on the image of it .
38199	0	a	the f
38200	0	a	the actual design .
38201	0	a	Kay .
38202	0	a	Good .
38203	0	a	Good .
38204	0	a	Okay .
38205	1	a	Gonna talk to you about the working design of the interiors basically
38206	0	a	which is what dictates the design the both the interface basically and the outer appearance because this is all the stuff that needs to go in there .
38207	0	a	Right .
38208	0	a	So
38209	0	a	unfortunately the people who were supposed to do this little presentation for me
38210	0	a	obviously were too drunk to actually accomplish it ,
38211	0	a	so
38212	1	a	I am going to do a lot of the stuff on the board .
38213	0	a	just
38214	0	a	This is the basic basic premise of a remote control .
38215	0	a	the basic function is to send messages to another system .
38216	0	a	Okay
38217	0	a	so much is clear .
38218	0	a	An energy source feeds an integrated circuit , like a chip , that can compose messages .
38219	0	a	Often in the form of infrared bits .
38220	0	a	This is the most mostly used .
38221	0	a	there is also some sound systems but infrared is the better or the more more used system .
38222	0	a	parts are cheaper as well .
38223	0	a	A user interface controls the chip and accordingly the messages .
38224	0	a	This is where my people screwed up basically .
38225	0	a	So I am going to explain that on the board rather .
38226	0	a	what we have is different components that obviously need to go in there .
38227	0	a	We will start with an energy source .
38228	0	a	Right .
38229	0	a	which is usually a battery
38230	0	a	right ?
38231	0	a	Since it is not feasible to add a cable to that .
38232	0	a	This energy source of course is connected to the the user interface itself .
38233	0	a	which can be buttons , whatever , which in fact controls a chip .
38234	0	a	Right ?
38235	0	a	This is the user interface and there we have the chip .
38236	0	a	the way this goes normally is that this chip then controls an infrared lamp .
38237	0	a	That sends out the signal .
38238	0	a	Of course the signal differs accordingly .
38239	0	a	depending on what the chip tells the infrared lan lamp .
38240	0	a	And Of course that is controlled , the chip itself is controlled by the user interface .
38241	0	a	The way you normally normally do it is that you add a little device such as a lamp to the whole thing as well , so that you know that it is working basically .
38242	0	a	You press something , you get a response .
38243	0	a	Which is also comparatively important on one of those devices .
38244	0	a	Now this ,
38245	1	a	what we are talking about here , or what I think should be discussed are these two components mostly .
38246	0	a	The the energy source for one thing can be altered .
38247	0	a	What we probably cannot alter is of course the infrared , the sending device basically , the infrared lamp .
38248	0	a	We cannot change the chip which controls the infrared lamp .
38249	0	a	Right ?
38250	0	a	These two are components that we have to use , and these are dictated by the whole function of the whole thing .
38251	0	a	the lamp can be put onto the desi the device .
38252	0	a	It c it does not have to be there .
38253	1	a	This can be discussed as well .
38254	1	a	The user interface .
38255	1	a	That is something we can also discuss .
38256	0	a	as we have heard speech recognition is the hype obviously in the moment .
38257	1	a	Speech recognition interface ,
38258	0	a	we do not know that .
38259	1	a	Or if we just do the usual button thing .
38260	1	a	Or we have a touch pad or something like that
38261	1	a	that is something we can discuss .
38262	1	a	And of course the energy source .
38263	1	a	Batteries .
38264	1	a	Solar cells .
38265	1	a	Who knows ?
38266	0	a	Of course it is always a question whether these these components are in fact available cheap enough , developed enough .
38267	1	a	But that is like I s
38268	1	a	I suppose rather up to marketing , and not to to the industrial design department .
38269	0	a	So
38270	0	a	we could the the
38271	0	a	the more complex we make it of course , the more expensive
38272	0	a	But people have said that they would
38273	0	a	well
38274	0	a	younger generations of people have said that they would pay more for a speech recognition remote .
38275	0	a	Expensive it is going to be get .
38276	0	a	Yeah .
38277	0	a	So
38278	0	a	possibly it might be worth the investment .
38279	0	a	Right .
38280	0	a	I think speech recognition was one of those things where they have to be really good for them to work .
38281	0	a	Cause sometimes you find yourself just saying things over and
38282	0	a	o if it is on your phone .
38283	0	a	Yeah .
38284	0	a	I agree .
38285	0	a	And you need to sort of take into light languages and then different dialects
38286	0	a	I suppose as well .
38287	0	a	Well
38288	0	a	I myself I find , when you , h when there is something like spee speech recognition .
38289	0	a	Like you call on the phone and you try to change your telephone or power or something .
38290	0	a	Sometimes they have a a speech recognition on the other end , and you say one for this , and you find yours , like you said , saying the same thing over and over and over .
38291	0	a	Yeah .
38292	0	a	I find myself , especially if I am in a crowd of people , looking really silly .
38293	0	a	Yeah .
38294	0	a	So
38295	0	a	maybe if you are sitting on your couch with a bunch of people then
38296	0	a	you know ,
38297	0	a	you
38298	0	a	Volume up .
38299	0	a	And wou I do not know
38300	0	a	if would
38301	0	a	would you want to keep saying stuff if you were watching stuff .
38302	0	a	If you were watching something would you sort of be wanting
38303	0	a	Yeah .
38304	0	a	Volume down .
38305	0	a	Change the channel , you know channel up , channel down ?
38306	0	a	I I do not know .
38307	0	a	Another thing about these figures is ninety one percent of the youngest age groups said they would do it , but probably a lot of them that is actually their parents money .
38308	0	a	Like
38309	0	a	I do not know if they would actually go out and purchase this themselves , a fifteen year old you know .
38310	0	a	I think
38311	0	a	As well it would be j the gimmick factor for the younger people .
38312	0	a	Yeah .
38313	0	a	But practically I do not think it is
38314	0	a	Yeah .
38315	0	a	It is a , it is a gimmick factor that they like at first ,
38316	0	a	and
38317	0	a	Okay .
38318	0	a	It will wear off .
38319	0	a	Gets old
38320	0	a	yeah .
38321	0	a	Let is see here .
38322	0	a	Do you want to put your cord back in ?
38323	1	a	I did have have a thought about the sort of the tracking thing .
38324	0	a	Yeah I guess so .
38325	0	a	Oh
38326	0	a	right .
38327	0	a	Trade you .
38328	0	a	go .
38329	0	a	Now
38330	0	a	I was sent a couple of things to modify our new requirements .
38331	0	a	the remote is only going to be for the television ,
38332	0	a	which is good
38333	0	a	because we already decided y your your research showed that not only is a universal remote more complicated , it is more cost , more costly .
38334	0	a	And your re research showed that you know most of the people do not even use it .
38335	0	a	I think you said fifty percent of the people only use half the or ten percent of the buttons .
38336	0	a	So if we remove the universal remote then that solves that problem .
38337	0	a	no teletext .
38338	0	a	So we do not have to worry about that .
38339	0	a	but we do have to use the
38340	0	a	the company wants us to incorporate the corporate colour and our slogan , which is we put the fashion in electronics .
38341	0	a	And our corporate colours are grey and yellow .
38342	1	a	And we could probably get away with black too but
38343	0	a	So those are the three the three new requirements that that I was told we need to use .
38344	0	a	from all all three of your presentations , I think that we were on the right track a lot in our last meeting .
38345	0	a	We want something that looks good .
38346	0	a	we want something that is simple .
38347	0	a	We want something that you can find easily .
38348	0	a	And the speech recognition I I guess is kind of give or take .
38349	0	a	It is going to cost more .
38350	0	a	S
38351	0	a	the young the younger people say that they like it .
38352	0	a	But it is probably , I would say , probably not worth the investment at this point in time .
38353	1	a	So maybe we should just do away with speech recognition .
38354	1	a	And that way we can focus on our form .
38355	0	a	Is that
38356	1	a	if it came with maybe a holder or holster , whatever you want to call it .
38357	1	a	that you you should put it back in .
38358	1	a	Your remote .
38359	1	a	But if you do not put it back in , you press something like a little button on that , and that just sort of sends out a beep to find where it is or something .
38360	1	a	Just by infrared .
38361	0	a	That should not be too complex I would have thought .
38362	0	a	That would be , that would be good if we were going with our our ball .
38363	0	a	Yeah it would be quite good .
38364	1	a	The ball could sit on a
38365	0	a	Yeah .
38366	0	a	Or or with you know I guess with any form that that would be good .
38367	0	a	You know
38368	1	a	that could be the charger .
38369	0	a	For
38370	0	a	you know
38371	1	a	we could use rechargeable batteries in the remote .
38372	0	a	And that would be
38373	1	a	or solar .
38374	0	a	Or
38375	0	a	you know
38376	1	a	However , however you wanted to go about it , the holder could also be the charging unit .
38377	0	a	Yeah .
38378	1	a	With the locator button .
38379	1	a	and if it were the ball you would no longer have to have a flat space on it .
38380	0	a	Yeah .
38381	0	a	like
38382	0	a	if
38383	0	a	we still have the how to hold on to it
38384	0	a	It is going to roll away .
38385	0	a	Well
38386	0	a	you still do .
38387	0	a	You s you still W
38388	0	a	yeah .
38389	0	a	You put it on t on the couch table .
38390	0	a	While you are watching , it is going to roll off .
38391	0	a	Rolls away
38392	0	a	yeah .
38393	0	a	So
38394	0	a	that is not an issue really .
38395	0	a	So
38396	0	a	I guess after the meeting we will have some questionnaires .
38397	0	a	And and some summaries for for what is going on .
38398	0	a	then we will take lunch .
38399	0	a	Then we can come back and work on our individual work .
38400	0	a	I will do the minutes .
38401	0	a	let is see .
38402	0	a	It looks like you are already on your way for working with the components .
38403	1	a	chips , the what chips we need
38404	0	a	and what
38405	0	a	you know
38406	1	a	how to power it and whatnot .
38407	0	a	User interface concept , we want it to be something simple .
38408	0	a	Yeah .
38409	0	a	Minimal number of buttons .
38410	1	a	I guess our , I guess our main main thing that we should focus on until then is probably deciding on a certain look , you know .
38411	0	a	Yeah .
38412	0	a	Right .
38413	0	a	That is
38414	0	a	Did you have time earlier to to work on that .
38415	0	a	Did you guys feel you have enough time in between our meetings to get everything done that you need to get done ?
38416	0	a	Kay .
38417	0	a	Not really .
38418	1	a	I will
38419	1	a	yeah
38420	1	a	I will have a look , try look at the actual appearance in the next break .
38421	0	a	I th
38422	0	a	I
38423	1	a	I do still think it needs to be something that is ultimately one handed .
38424	0	a	The ball is probably not a good idea .
38425	0	a	And even something that is held like that might be difficult .
38426	1	a	So that I think it still has to be a variation .
38427	1	a	On maybe a a rect on a rectangle but maybe not necessarily as boring , as plain as a rectangle .
38428	0	a	Shall we maybe shoot for a a specific target group ?
38429	0	a	That way we could l
38430	0	a	I mean if it were ,
38431	0	a	if we were shooting for young guys then it is a certain look to the remote .
38432	0	a	Or girls or older people ?
38433	0	a	Would that
38434	0	a	you think that would help us find a specific form ?
38435	0	a	That we would would want to pick out ?
38436	0	a	Kay .
38437	0	a	D
38438	0	a	I do not know if that might cope with like the trend watching .
38439	0	a	I find anything more on that .
38440	0	a	Yeah not yet
38441	0	a	but maybe by the next meeting we will have some info on that .
38442	0	a	So
38443	0	a	we know that the remote is going to have to be
38444	0	a	we will just say we have got a colour scheme for it .
38445	0	a	Yeah .
38446	0	a	yellow and
38447	0	a	you know
38448	0	a	yellow it is nice and bright ,
38449	0	a	with the buttons being grey or black .
38450	1	a	And our slogan pasted somewhere on it , on the the bottom
38451	0	a	or the
38452	0	a	you know .
38453	1	a	Bottom perhaps
38454	0	a	yeah .
38455	1	a	Maybe we could sketch a
38456	0	a	so basically
38457	0	a	all of our remotes all of our typical remotes now are just kind of a rectangular sort .
38458	0	a	You know .
38459	1	a	maybe we could flare it or something .
38460	0	a	You know .
38461	0	a	So it is more
38462	0	a	of course this will look like a bone then .
38463	0	a	go ahead and erase this .
38464	0	a	Hope everyone memorised that
38465	0	a	Yeah .
38466	0	a	You
38467	0	a	I mean
38468	1	a	it might be to look at sort of the the shape and trend of like things like mobile phones , and the shapes that the they have been going .
38469	0	a	Yeah .
38470	0	a	They have gone from big brick block things , which is a remote control is , to sort of slinky small things .
38471	0	a	Yeah
38472	0	a	everybody is got a mobile phone right ?
38473	0	a	Except for me now .
38474	0	a	But they are all ,
38475	0	a	you know ,
38476	0	a	mobile phones they have kind of taken a turn to where they are really small .
38477	0	a	Yeah .
38478	0	a	which may defeat our purpose for being able to locate our remote all the time .
38479	0	a	Right .
38480	0	a	But then again you do not want you know like the first mobile phone
38481	0	a	that was this big and you had a handbag to carry it around in .
38482	0	a	So
38483	0	a	we have got
38484	0	a	basically what remotes look like now is kind of what we are what we are stuck with .
38485	1	a	Maybe we could go with a square or something .
38486	0	a	you know
38487	1	a	with minimal number of buttons .
38488	0	a	Hm .
38489	1	a	I guess you have got you know one through nine .
38490	1	a	For typing in your channels .
38491	1	a	you have got volume , up and down .
38492	1	a	Channel up and down .
38493	1	a	Power .
38494	0	a	Power .
38495	0	a	Usually at the top .
38496	1	a	a mute .
38497	0	a	That is the classical design .
38498	0	a	That is that is pretty much all you need I think .
38499	1	a	A menu button , maybe .
38500	0	a	Right .
38501	0	a	So you know .
38502	0	a	If you ,
38503	1	a	if we want the remote to do other things like or I guess the TV to be able to change the tint and the colour
38504	1	a	and you know all those kind of things that are built into TVs , we just have that under one standard menu button where you go in , press the menu button , scroll up and down to select it .
38505	0	a	Yeah .
38506	0	a	Yeah .
38507	0	a	Kay
38508	0	a	so
38509	1	a	Talking of which maybe a scrolling function is not not too bad .
38510	0	a	It is Talk about maybe f
38511	1	a	look at that from the side , there maybe .
38512	0	a	Which is technically the easiest option .
38513	1	a	Would probably be like a scrolling , little scrolling wheel like this .
38514	0	a	Yeah .
38515	0	a	Yeah .
38516	0	a	Yeah .
38517	0	a	Like a wheel on your mouse .
38518	0	a	So .
38519	0	a	Yeah , sort of like that .
38520	0	a	Sort of .
38521	0	a	You can even
38522	1	a	if we are coming from mice , we can even add a click function , where you , in order to verify the information you just press it down .
38523	0	a	Right .
38524	0	a	Is a good idea .
38525	1	a	Also when it comes to the ergonomics of the whole thing , if you want to make it square for the looks of it , then maybe to make it more comfortable to hold the whole thing , you add a little bulge down here .
38526	0	a	Just
38527	1	a	which maybe from an engineering point this could be holding the the batteries and so on .
38528	0	a	I know .
38529	0	a	You know what I am getting at here ,
38530	0	a	fel look at it from the side .
38531	0	a	Look g
38532	0	a	yeah .
38533	0	a	Looks good .
38534	0	a	It is like that .
38535	0	a	Right .
38536	1	a	Then you hold it in your hand like this .
38537	1	a	And maybe you bring the buttons nearer to the or the imp more important buttons nearer to the to the side .
38538	0	a	Yes
38539	1	a	To the thumb
38540	0	a	yeah .
38541	1	a	To the thumb .
38542	0	a	Yeah .
38543	0	a	Right .
38544	0	a	Maybe the buttons could like decrease in s
38545	1	a	the bigger ones you know they could actually be bigger in size than the ones that are less important , the smaller here .
38546	0	a	Right .
38547	1	a	You can also have it , maybe , talking about mobile phones again , sliding open .
38548	0	a	Yeah .
38549	1	a	With the lesser used functions on this part , and then it slides into that part .
38550	1	a	Behind .
38551	0	a	Definitely .
38552	1	a	And out .
38553	0	a	just like o
38554	1	a	on a sort of side view .
38555	1	a	Something that you know it would sort of fit in the hand better .
38556	0	a	So you know
38557	0	a	you just sort of have your hand
38558	0	a	Yeah .
38559	0	a	well
38560	0	a	I was just thinking , this this of course causes causes a problem for left or right handed people actually .
38561	0	a	Right on the
38562	0	a	and your thumb would be up here type thing .
38563	0	a	Yeah that is also true .
38564	0	a	So .
38565	0	a	instantly sort of always going for the right handed person .
38566	0	a	Right .
38567	0	a	But I mean the older so
38568	0	a	Right handed , yeah .
38569	0	a	Yeah
38570	0	a	is everyone who in here is right handed , left handed ?
38571	0	a	You guys all right handed ?
38572	0	a	Yeah .
38573	0	a	Right .
38574	0	a	Right .
38575	0	a	So
38576	0	a	I am left handed but I , so I can say that most things are designed for right handed people .
38577	0	a	Uh huh .
38578	0	a	That is right .
38579	0	a	Like the written language .
38580	0	a	Or English .
38581	1	a	Maybe you could buy like a special left handed version of the remote .
38582	0	a	Maybe .
38583	0	a	Ow .
38584	1	a	Special order .
38585	0	a	I would say
38586	0	a	I mean
38587	1	a	it should be probably designed for a right handed p person .
38588	0	a	Yeah .
38589	0	a	but that is that is good .
38590	0	a	That is w
38591	0	a	I think we have got a kind of a good plan there .
38592	0	a	At least for what buttons we are going to use .
38593	0	a	So we have got
38594	0	a	I like the scroll , the scroll action
38595	0	a	and the .
38596	1	a	I mean I am just just thinking maybe if it was circular with the sort of that sort of the sort of early idea we had , with the way that was more like that ,
38597	0	a	whereas this is just a one handed thing that you sort of almost wrap round the thumb .
38598	0	a	So you would have your ,
38599	0	a	you would put your hand into there with the thumb there .
38600	0	a	And then your thumb would do
38601	1	a	you would have all the buttons sort of round here .
38602	0	a	And that I think could work .
38603	0	a	Yeah .
38604	0	a	On any hand .
38605	0	a	Kinda like holding a
38606	0	a	Yeah .
38607	0	a	If you just had it like wrapped round there .
38608	0	a	Left or right .
38609	0	a	Right .
38610	0	a	That minimises it size wise as well .
38611	0	a	Minimise its size .
38612	0	a	It could be you know really quite small .
38613	1	a	Then there is maybe another point of making it a two in one kind of thing .
38614	1	a	If we have a smaller a smaller device that actually fits into the big one .
38615	1	a	You give it the full functions in here , and just a couple of functions in there .
38616	0	a	Yeah .
38617	1	a	Like your zap zapping device is just u channels up down , volume , and on off .
38618	1	a	Zapping functions .
38619	1	a	That is it .
38620	0	a	Could be good .
38621	0	a	Maybe .
38622	0	a	So two remotes in one .
38623	0	a	But then would be easier to lose one or the other .
38624	0	a	That is right .
38625	1	a	Means the big one has to be sufficiently big .
38626	1	a	And perhaps heavy ,
38627	0	a	so you ca not move it around .
38628	0	a	Make it a piece of furniture .
38629	0	a	Yeah ,
38630	0	a	yeah .
38631	0	a	It actually is your coffee table .
38632	0	a	yes .
38633	0	a	Yes , there you go .
38634	0	a	Or a statue or something .
38635	0	a	Okay .
38636	0	a	Well
38637	1	a	we need to finish up here .
38638	0	a	So for the next So for the next before the next meeting w sh shall we work on
38639	0	a	you are watching trends to see what what kind of new information we have got going on .
38640	0	a	Yep .
38641	0	a	Manuel you are going to work on the components for for what we are going to use .
38642	0	a	Right .
38643	1	a	Let is go with our our rounded kind of fit in your hand let is explore the the possibility of having the two piece .
38644	0	a	So one for the the quick zapping and possibly one you know with just that rounded part that fits into your hand .
38645	0	a	Alright .
38646	0	a	Yeah .
38647	1	a	And Ryan you work on how how well they will work with the us with the user .
38648	0	a	How well it will work
38649	0	a	yeah .
38650	1	a	So both of those concepts .
38651	0	a	And okay
38652	0	a	I think we made some good progress here .
38653	0	a	Alright .
38654	0	a	see you in
38655	0	a	I dunno .
38656	0	a	I gu
38657	0	a	I guess we will take lunch in
38658	0	a	about half an hour .
38659	0	a	Or I guess we will be taking lunch shortly
38660	0	a	and then then in about half an hour after that we will probably have another meeting .
38661	0	a	 
38662	0	a	Okay .
38663	0	a	Right .
38664	0	a	Okay .
38665	0	a	Alright .
38666	0	a	Is everyone here ?
38667	0	a	Okay .
38668	0	a	Yep .
38669	0	a	Yep .
38670	0	a	This is our conceptual design meeting .
38671	0	a	And
38672	0	a	I will just take a few minutes and go through the previous minutes .
38673	0	a	then each of you will have your presentation , and then we will need to make a decision on the concept for the remote control .
38674	0	a	And then we will have forty minutes for finishing up .
38675	1	a	I will go through the mee through the minutes first .
38676	0	a	, we just refreshed our our goal of making the finest remote control available .
38677	0	a	we decided that , or we know that we need to use company colours , company logo .
38678	0	a	and
38679	0	a	our Marketing Expert gave us some i information from interviews with a hundred different remote users .
38680	0	a	with some statistics that backed basically what we were thinking before .
38681	0	a	People thought their remotes were ugly , that remotes zap a lot .
38682	0	a	they only use a finite amount of buttons .
38683	0	a	and that they often lose the
38684	0	a	it is easy to lose a remote .
38685	0	a	which were all things we were thinking we would want to make it simple .
38686	0	a	And some sort of locator .
38687	0	a	Either a button or tracking device .
38688	0	a	And that it should look different than what is out there .
38689	0	a	Kind of mixed mixed response on the speech recognition .
38690	0	a	The younger people said they wanted it , older people did not .
38691	0	a	I think we decided that the expense was not necessarily worth it , and that it was probably a gimmick , that would increasingly wear on the consumers' nerves .
38692	0	a	Then the User Interface Designer explored some of the technical functions of the remote .
38693	0	a	the simple versus the the complex .
38694	0	a	The simple one being better for a user , the complex better for an engineer .
38695	0	a	and some personal preferences that were found in that would be that it should be a user oriented remote , something simple .
38696	0	a	and that we did not want to go with a universal remote , because increasing cost and increasing complexity .
38697	0	a	we would just have a TV remote .
38698	0	a	and that we should also focus on the appearance of the remote .
38699	0	a	Have it s be something that looks different .
38700	0	a	And finally our Industrial Designer gave us a rundown of how the remote will work .
38701	0	a	from energy source , what we would use .
38702	0	a	Batteries because we do not want to have a a cable .
38703	0	a	How that would power the remote and the lamp .
38704	0	a	If we were to to have one .
38705	0	a	the user interface then would connect to a chip , which would work with the infrared controls to send the signal to the TV .
38706	0	a	I believe then we came up with a couple of ideas for what we think the design of the remote will be .
38707	0	a	something that will fit into easily into someone is hand .
38708	0	a	And with a , just a few buttons .
38709	0	a	Just the basics .
38710	0	a	And with a scrolling function also .
38711	0	a	Okay
38712	0	a	and I will leave that , leave it at that .
38713	0	a	So
38714	1	a	Marketing ?
38715	0	a	We are watching trends .
38716	1	a	Okay .
38717	0	a	Yep .
38718	1	a	Can I have your cable please ?
38719	0	a	Thanks .
38720	0	a	I suppose that you can have this .
38721	0	a	Okay so I was looking at trend watching .
38722	0	a	unfortunately I was not given too much information .
38723	0	a	I was given a brief executive summary , and then an update on some recent fashion trends that we might like to look at .
38724	1	a	And then I will just tell you some personal preferences that I got from that .
38725	0	a	okay the most important finding was that the fancy look and feel seems to be twice as important to the users as the current functional look and feel design , which I think we have kind of already discussed before .
38726	0	a	the second most important finding was that the remote should be technologically innovative .
38727	0	a	And again these are all things we have kind of already come up with on our own , but this just backs it up .
38728	0	a	And thirdly the remote would be easy to use .
38729	0	a	As far as fashion update , we have learned that fruits and vegetables will be the most important theme for cloths , shoes and furniture .
38730	0	a	So that might be a bit of a challenge to incorporate this into our remote ,
38731	1	a	but we can try .
38732	0	a	and also , as opposed to last year , this year the material is expected to be spongy in feel .
38733	0	a	Okay so from that , as we have already said , we need to focus on a fancy look and feel .
38734	0	a	I think we have already discovered that it is kind of hard to go away from the traditional rectangular design .
38735	1	a	But I think that , even if it is very subtle , we need to kind of trick our consumers ,
38736	0	a	so they at least get the idea that they are getting something that is new and modern and sleek and Whether it is through the shape or the colours or all of that .
38737	0	a	for technologically innovative , we have talked about the tracking device .
38738	1	a	We brought up the idea of having two pieces , which we could discuss further .
38739	0	a	And Manuel had suggested the energy source and the user interface , discussing some of those , that we could change a little bit .
38740	0	a	We need to keep it simple , have limited buttons ,
38741	0	a	which I think the two piece idea might be really beneficial for .
38742	0	a	we need to incorporate this fashion trend of fruits and vegetables .
38743	0	a	I do not know ,
38744	1	a	I mean I guess the two options are if we had our remote in the shape of a fruit or vegetable .
38745	1	a	Oh it was sort of banana shaped .
38746	0	a	Yeah .
38747	1	a	A banana shape ?
38748	0	a	So possibly like a ,
38749	0	a	sorry ,
38750	1	a	just to butt in for a second .
38751	0	a	Yeah .
38752	0	a	Right .
38753	1	a	Or with exterior designs .
38754	0	a	But my question is , I mean the stereotypically speaking , you kind of picture males with their remote controls , and I am not sure how they would feel about having fruity logos on the outside .
38755	1	a	So maybe we could have something that is somewhat removable ,
38756	0	a	or I do not know , different options for female , male target groups .
38757	0	a	And then the spongy feel .
38758	1	a	I guess we could look at mobile phones and other technology that is out there .
38759	1	a	C and look at different types of material that might please our users who want spongy feeling remote controls .
38760	0	a	So that is that .
38761	0	a	Alright .
38762	1	a	Possibly like a cover like they have for mobile phones ?
38763	1	a	You have one with a flag , and one with a banana and one that is a spongy
38764	0	a	feel to it .
38765	0	a	That is what I was thinking yeah .
38766	0	a	Those like , yeah , sort of spongy ones .
38767	0	a	Yeah .
38768	0	a	So when you buy your remote you can buy various coverings .
38769	0	a	You can
38770	0	a	various covers .
38771	0	a	What is it called ?
38772	0	a	Cust you
38773	0	a	personalised , yeah .
38774	0	a	Personalise your remote .
38775	0	a	We could leave that to the cover department .
38776	0	a	Yeah .
38777	0	a	We all know they have got nothing to do all day .
38778	0	a	Okay .
38779	0	a	Why ca not I see the
38780	0	a	crazy .
38781	1	a	yeah
38782	1	a	I talking about the interface concept and how the customer relates to , will use the , consumer will use the actual device .
38783	0	a	so I have looked at some of the stuff I was sent , , try and get some inspiration .
38784	0	a	But keep in mind that our own ideas that we had .
38785	0	a	I was sent some information from the company saying that they , the technology department have devised a new speech recognition technology , where you can program questions into such devices .
38786	0	a	They gave an example of a coffee machine where you program a question , you program the answer , and the machine responds accordingly .
38787	0	a	okay .
38788	0	a	There is different ways of a user can use products l like a remote .
38789	0	a	there is a graphical use , where you you look at pictures and well on a screen .
38790	0	a	A command line where you obviously type things in , and you get a response .
38791	0	a	and then it ju that is just to point out the sort of inconsistent u sort of use of interface in remotes .
38792	0	a	You ca not really see that picture well , but there is various different remotes , once again with lots of different buttons on , making it more complicated .
38793	0	a	So , then I had a look at new products that are on the market .
38794	0	a	Not necessarily remote controls but ones that you will recognise .
38795	0	a	this is the voice , there is a voice recognition remote control , which can control mus multiple devices .
38796	0	a	I have a
38797	0	a	there is a picture .
38798	0	a	You surf your favourite channels with your voice .
38799	0	a	Store up to eighty speech samples , controls four devices , TV , cable , satellite , VCR , DVD and audio .
38800	0	a	And you can record your own v verbal labels , that are connected to remote control functions .
38801	0	a	So the technology is there .
38802	0	a	the one on the left is very similar to what we drew up on the board in the previous meeting , where there has scroll down functions on the side .
38803	0	a	You can sort of just make those out .
38804	0	a	And then on the right is obviously an iPod , which is you know possibly one of the simplest things to use out there ,
38805	0	a	and really is ,
38806	0	a	and all that is is just a a nice big scroll menu that y you sort of go through .
38807	0	a	That is a possibility .
38808	0	a	And nothing is simpler really .
38809	0	a	then there is things like this , which is a a a kid is remote , where the the parents have the facility to control and program what children can watch before .
38810	0	a	So the remote control it o only allows them to access the channels that their parents want them to watch .
38811	0	a	And it means that th children have a novelty of having their own remote control .
38812	0	a	So I do not know if there is a possibility of having one remote contr you know like we just had two components ,
38813	1	a	maybe it can have more components you know , different remotes .
38814	0	a	the point made at the end there here is that you have to be sort of be need to be clear on your devices , as to what , you know , things you use .
38815	0	a	Sometimes an arrow pointing down , which may suggest volume down , could become confused just as a V for volume .
38816	0	a	Just little things like that , which would need to be made clear in the design .
38817	1	a	I think , d carrying on from what I have already said , a user friendly remote with minimum buttons .
38818	0	a	Maybe we have so suggested this two part thing , where if it was to have a speech recognition thing ,
38819	1	a	you could maybe control that on the do it or program all that on the control bit .
38820	1	a	And then just have the simple sort of hand held thing that we sort of devised earlier , as the actual remote .
38821	0	a	I do not
38822	1	a	it could be a graphical display , the actual remote contr the actual control port maybe could have like an iPod where you just sort of control through the menus .
38823	0	a	Stuff like gets more and more compli complicated .
38824	0	a	And then the the hand held bit should be ergonomically designed .
38825	0	a	And that is it .
38826	0	a	Why am I
38827	0	a	Oh yeah .
38828	0	a	Just .
38829	0	a	Where are we ? .
38830	1	a	Just to sort of show you .
38831	0	a	M they have even got things like that .
38832	0	a	Huge things .
38833	0	a	Which is just for your gr ninety year old grandma
38834	0	a	yeah ?
38835	0	a	Yeah .
38836	0	a	That is industrial design for cranes , stuff like that .
38837	0	a	Yeah .
38838	0	a	Dunno .
38839	0	a	And that
38840	0	a	yeah .
38841	0	a	Makes sense , makes sense .
38842	0	a	Notice the giant dog bone shape ?
38843	0	a	Also good for animals .
38844	0	a	Yeah .
38845	0	a	See .
38846	0	a	things .
38847	0	a	Why is my screen crazy ?
38848	0	a	Well let is see .
38849	1	a	I am going to bore you with a couple of descriptions of the interior .
38850	0	a	Just to to make it more obvious what we have to fit in there , and that we do have to fit the stuff in there .
38851	0	a	I have more information on possible materials as well .
38852	0	a	What we can and cannot do .
38853	1	a	but let is just wait for this to load up
38854	1	a	and I will show you what we are talking about here .
38855	0	a	Okay .
38856	0	a	The details of the components' design , as you can see there , what we have is the board , main board of the remote control .
38857	0	a	The underside , that is pretty cheap piece of of technology really top left side
38858	0	a	you can see the chip , which is the , what we were talking about , this was is the device to recognise the signals the input , and it passes it on to a row of further transistors and stuff like that on the right side that actually amplify the signal , which later on is being
38859	0	a	, is being transferred to a infrared lamp which then of course shines infrared light onto the television which then will recognise what signal it is getting and will do what you tell it .
38860	0	a	So much for the the workings of the of the remote control itself .
38861	0	a	Its job is to wait for you to press a key , then to translate that key press into infrared light signals , that are received by the television .
38862	0	a	When you press a key you complete a specific connection .
38863	0	a	The chip senses the connection and knows what button you pressed .
38864	0	a	It produces a morse code line signal specific to that button .
38865	0	a	Right .
38866	0	a	Pretty clear .
38867	0	a	Transistor amplifies the signal and then sends the m sends the signal to the LED which translates the signal into infrared light .
38868	0	a	The sensor in the TV can see the infrared light , and seeing the signal reacts appropriately .
38869	0	a	This is the circuit board from the other side .
38870	0	a	the lower part of it ,
38871	0	a	I do not know if you can see that properly ,
38872	0	a	with the green greenish board is is what we what we saw in the first the first slide just flipped over .
38873	0	a	you can see the circuit board itself .
38874	0	a	That is the cheapest way to make electronic connections basically on the market .
38875	0	a	what you do is you have , do not have cables , but you have the connections actually in these in these lines on the on the board .
38876	0	a	These are the actual keys that are being pressed .
38877	0	a	They close the electric circuit .
38878	0	a	That then sends the signal to the chip on the other side .
38879	0	a	That would be behind here .
38880	0	a	which sends it over to the transistors and all that stuff that amplify the signal and all that is being sent to the infrared lamp up there .
38881	0	a	Now as you can see this is the the rubber button version of it .
38882	0	a	the way it works is that you have the keys here .
38883	0	a	The rubber button has a little metal plate on the other side , which closes the circuit here .
38884	0	a	And thus gives on the signal .
38885	0	a	Now this is the simple version .
38886	0	a	we are talking this this the simple and cheapest version at the same time .
38887	0	a	We are talking something more complicated of course , it is going to be more expensive as well .
38888	0	a	And not only that .
38889	0	a	we are also restricted in the use of our outer shell , or in the material that we could use for our outer shell .
38890	0	a	I have gotten some information that we could use for the case material plastic , rubber , as well .
38891	0	a	rubber that is used in these anti stress balls .
38892	0	a	So it is pretty squishy .
38893	0	a	That would that would serve that purpose .
38894	0	a	Spongy ?
38895	0	a	Y probably not
38896	0	a	yeah .
38897	0	a	we could also use wood , or titanium .
38898	0	a	What is the approximate per hundred thousand for the titanium ?
38899	0	a	Works well in Arizona but in Edinburgh
38900	0	a	not so
38901	0	a	No
38902	0	a	I think I think batteries are probably the way to go .
38903	0	a	Oh fya
38904	0	a	I do not have an information on that .
38905	0	a	However our company obviously can provide us with with the titanium , so I assume , I am , I was given an okay to use it .
38906	0	a	It certainly is an expensive material ,
38907	0	a	I am aware of that , but I was given an okay .
38908	0	a	But there are certain restrictions to certain materials .
38909	1	a	Now let is first go through the list with the materials .
38910	0	a	So we what we can use is plastic , rubber , wood and titanium .
38911	0	a	Can also mix these .
38912	0	a	as for the energy source , we were talking about that shortly in the other meeting .
38913	0	a	what we could use is , or what I was offered , or what we could use , is a basic bateer battery .
38914	0	a	Right ?
38915	0	a	a dynamo .
38916	0	a	Interestingly enough .
38917	0	a	we could use solar cells .
38918	0	a	Or a device that was not n not further specified that provides kinetic energy .
38919	0	a	Such as like watches you know .
38920	0	a	Where you just move them m move the the actual device and this pr provides it with with some energy .
38921	0	a	So obviously I personally have to say that dynamo is out of the question really .
38922	0	a	You do not want to wind up your remote control before you can use it
38923	0	a	right ?
38924	0	a	solar cell is interesting .
38925	0	a	May fail though , every here and there .
38926	0	a	Would you have to leave it by the window ?
38927	0	a	yeah .
38928	0	a	Yeah .
38929	0	a	Or you know you lose it , it lies behind the couch for a week
38930	0	a	and yeah .
38931	0	a	Yeah .
38932	0	a	Always the you
38933	0	a	But
38934	0	a	exactly .
38935	0	a	Yeah .
38936	0	a	the kinetic energy thing might work , but the same problem .
38937	0	a	You leave it lying around and you first have to shake it before it it starts to work .
38938	0	a	So I would say what we are stuck with really is the basic battery .
38939	0	a	Which also makes a base station basically obsolete .
38940	0	a	We do not need that then .
38941	0	a	However
38942	0	a	our interface options are push buttons .
38943	0	a	In which in the production of which or in manufacture of which our company is expert .
38944	0	a	However we have discussed that scroll wheels are a better option .
38945	0	a	And they are possible .
38946	0	a	We have an okay for scroll wheels .
38947	0	a	Okay .
38948	0	a	however when it comes to the scroll wheel of the iPod I have one big objection and that is that we have to fit an LCD into the remote control as well .
38949	0	a	This however may exclude certain materials .
38950	0	a	If you have a squishy kind of remote control , then an LCD screen may be affected by the movement .
38951	0	a	Hence we might not be able to put it in there .
38952	0	a	So
38953	0	a	There is also restrictions to , when it comes to the chip .
38954	0	a	If we have a more sophistic sophisticated scroll wheel rather than this very basic set up that we that I have just presented , the chip has to be more s more sophisticated and thus more expensive as well .
38955	0	a	I do not have any details to , when it comes to the cost but it will be a significant difference .
38956	1	a	I would rather say drop the titanium and therefore let is have a more sophisticated chip ,
38957	0	a	but that is not up to me to decide really .
38958	0	a	So that is for the for the scroll wheel .
38959	0	a	it limits our choice
38960	1	a	and squishy is hip , so I would say rather not go for for that .
38961	0	a	Let is see now .
38962	0	a	solar cells cannot be used on a curved or latex surface or remote control .
38963	0	a	But obviously that is not our problem since we have decided or against solar cells , I assume
38964	0	a	right ?
38965	0	a	Or is anybody still
38966	0	a	alright .
38967	0	a	Yeah .
38968	0	a	No .
38969	0	a	Alright .
38970	0	a	Yeah .
38971	0	a	which makes it very conventional but therefore traditional I assume .
38972	0	a	With the titanium we cannot make it a curved design .
38973	0	a	We would just be able to make it flat and
38974	0	a	and yeah
38975	0	a	a straight design pretty much .
38976	0	a	Which I assume would exclude some of the more sophisticated versions .
38977	0	a	Would the sort of spongy and the the plasticky thing
38978	0	a	y
38979	0	a	you can get those mobile phones that initially have a
38980	0	a	it is plastic
38981	0	a	but then they have sort of a
38982	0	a	a s a cover on it which is just sort of soft and stuff .
38983	0	a	Like a covering .
38984	0	a	Yeah .
38985	0	a	So I do not know if that would still be possible to have you know in plastic .
38986	0	a	But then where do people hold it ?
38987	0	a	Just all be sort of spongy .
38988	0	a	Yeah .
38989	1	a	The we can have the fruits and vegetables on the spongy parts , so they can remove it .
38990	0	a	So you
38991	0	a	as the the possibility of having a a graphical display on it , like a screen ?
38992	0	a	Like the iPod ?
38993	0	a	Right .
38994	0	a	You can have an LCD screen .
38995	0	a	but therefore no rubber will be used .
38996	0	a	Alright ?
38997	0	a	So plastic yes , titanium yes , but this will of course influence the form .
38998	0	a	With plastic , as I understand it , you can use any form .
38999	0	a	latex is tricky .
39000	0	a	Or rubber and and titanium also seems to be tricky when it comes to the form .
39001	0	a	So the way to go is if you want a scroll wheel you either make it flat and angular , add an LCD screen , and then you can basically choose either plastic or titanium .
39002	0	a	Yeah .
39003	0	a	Or wood even .
39004	0	a	if you want to make it a particular shape , use plastic .
39005	0	a	Add an LCD screen , add a scroll wheel , that will be fine .
39006	0	a	Yeah .
39007	0	a	Or make it just push buttons .
39008	0	a	Basically plastic gives you the b biggest variety of of options .
39009	0	a	Maybe not the nicest feel .
39010	0	a	Or not much originality really .
39011	0	a	So the ru wait the rubbery we can shape it however we want ?
39012	0	a	Or the rubbery we cannot ?
39013	0	a	Kay .
39014	0	a	With rubber we could sh pretty much shape it the way we wanted it , but we cannot add scroll wheels , and we cannot add an LCD screen .
39015	0	a	That is the tricky thing .
39016	1	a	Could we not you know have a shape with a scroll and the screen , and then j just sort of that initial shape we had , just which is sort of banana esque .
39017	1	a	So that is thing if we did it yellow .
39018	0	a	Yeah .
39019	0	a	And you know you just p stick on just sort of rubber things that that sort of grip the thumb bit .
39020	0	a	They would not have any
39021	0	a	they are just on the exterior .
39022	0	a	They would not be necessary to the actual shape of the thing .
39023	0	a	Is that an option , a plastic shell with a rubbery coating on at certain spots ?
39024	1	a	What about a smell ?
39025	1	a	T to the remote ?
39026	0	a	Yellow and grey .
39027	0	a	S Certainly can be done yes .
39028	0	a	yeah .
39029	0	a	if that does not affect the functional side of it all .
39030	0	a	Yeah .
39031	0	a	Like say just the underside or so then it can be done .
39032	0	a	I assume .
39033	0	a	Yeah .
39034	0	a	So
39035	0	a	The fruit design
39036	1	a	How about affecting the surface of the actual remote control ?
39037	1	a	Say we do not make it p a particular fruit shape obviously , but give it like the surface of an orange , banana , whatever .
39038	1	a	You name it .
39039	0	a	Just design wise .
39040	0	a	Nice one .
39041	1	a	You could just sell it in different colours as well I suppose .
39042	1	a	In different yellows .
39043	0	a	Bright citrus colours
39044	0	a	yeah .
39045	0	a	I do not suppose we have to stick to co
39046	0	a	Stick to the colours
39047	0	a	yeah .
39048	0	a	Well we we are supposed to stick to the company colours though , that is yellow and grey .
39049	0	a	Oh yeah .
39050	0	a	Yellow and grey .
39051	0	a	So what have we ,
39052	0	a	lemon , banana , is
39053	0	a	Grapefruit
39054	1	a	is what we would go for , when it comes to the outer appearance perhaps .
39055	0	a	grapefruit .
39056	0	a	Grapefruit .
39057	0	a	But .
39058	1	a	I would say , if I were to make a decision , I would probably put the fruit aspect at the lower lower end of the spectrum of of importance .
39059	0	a	Yeah .
39060	0	a	Well perhaps the implied shape will be enough to lure that fruit minded remote buyer .
39061	0	a	I think having a shape could be a little ridiculous ,
39062	0	a	like
39063	0	a	Well we kind of do
39064	0	a	yeah .
39065	0	a	Yeah .
39066	0	a	Well we have it banana shaped already , kind of .
39067	0	a	Yeah .
39068	0	a	So
39069	0	a	Right .
39070	0	a	Yeah .
39071	1	a	And if it is yellow ?
39072	1	a	Grey buttons
39073	1	a	yeah .
39074	1	a	and if it if it was done yellow , which is a company colour .
39075	1	a	It is it is yellow .
39076	1	a	I it is yellow .
39077	1	a	It is curved .
39078	1	a	Well so why not add a couple of grey stripes and make it look like a banana ?
39079	0	a	There you go .
39080	0	a	It is sort of
39081	0	a	couple of couple of grey stripes .
39082	0	a	Yeah .
39083	1	a	We could put the grey stripes on the bottom so that that person could turn it over .
39084	0	a	On the the gr
39085	1	a	the rubbery grips could be grey .
39086	0	a	It would look like a banana just sitting on their table .
39087	0	a	Yeah .
39088	0	a	Rather than rather th
39089	1	a	Maybe the holder , if we were to have a holder , it could be shaped like a fruit .
39090	0	a	It could
39091	0	a	and then you could actually h put the banana shaped thing on the fruit bowl , on the coffee table , and then people would always know where it was .
39092	0	a	Oh .
39093	0	a	Nice .
39094	1	a	Could look like a fruit bowl .
39095	0	a	It could be an ape .
39096	0	a	Could be ,
39097	0	a	it could be an ape or a fruit bowl .
39098	0	a	Yeah .
39099	0	a	we could have a variety of options here .
39100	0	a	Yeah .
39101	0	a	Kay .
39102	0	a	Yeah .
39103	0	a	Do you have more to your presentation ?
39104	0	a	Oh .
39105	0	a	That is pretty much it .
39106	0	a	I informed you about the materials , what the interior has to look like , and what the limitations to certain materials are on
39107	0	a	there you go .
39108	0	a	Okay .
39109	1	a	I am going to plug in here real quick .
39110	0	a	Sure .
39111	0	a	If I could .
39112	0	a	Hang on .
39113	0	a	There you go .
39114	0	a	Like I said we have to make a decision on a couple of these items here .
39115	0	a	ow .
39116	0	a	Ow .
39117	0	a	So is the two piece idea out ?
39118	0	a	Or have we not decided ?
39119	0	a	Oh right
39120	0	a	okay .
39121	0	a	Well we sort of rid of that because going to use a battery .
39122	0	a	And the base station might not be necessary .
39123	0	a	Well we can still design a two piece remote without having a base , having one of them be a base station , but just have it be an optional either big remote with lots of functions , or you take out the smaller piece .
39124	0	a	Yeah .
39125	0	a	Yeah .
39126	0	a	We can still do that .
39127	0	a	However of course this would be like designing two remotes pretty much .
39128	0	a	So which then , as I understand it , would probably limit the , limit again the the the use of certain materials , because they would be too expensive .
39129	0	a	Say like have a scroll wheel and on both of them , or have an LCD screen and so on so on .
39130	0	a	You would probably have to stick rather with a just traditional rubber button design which we saw there .
39131	0	a	But could be done , of course .
39132	0	a	Okay .
39133	0	a	so these are the decisions that we do need to make by the end of this meeting .
39134	0	a	for our components concept we need to come up with the energy source , the chip on print , and the case .
39135	0	a	Probably case material .
39136	0	a	And probably a shape also .
39137	0	a	and then for the user interface concept we need to decide what the tape , what , what the type is .
39138	0	a	And what kind of supplements we will have .
39139	0	a	Energy source
39140	0	a	I think we have
39141	0	a	, I think we have decided batteries , although not exciting , are probably our best bet .
39142	0	a	Right .
39143	0	a	And we have five minutes .
39144	0	a	Okay when it comes to the chip on print , as I said , the the more advanced features you want , the fancier the chip has to be and the more expensive .
39145	0	a	if you want just a normal button version , the chip on print is going to be a cheap one .
39146	0	a	Right ?
39147	0	a	Yeah .
39148	0	a	Kay .
39149	0	a	So
39150	1	a	I guess we should pick the case then .
39151	0	a	If we go with the plasticky case , or the the plastic case , then the chip on print is still kind of , we could have either or .
39152	0	a	We could have a complex one or a a non complex .
39153	0	a	But did we decide that the rubbery feel was important enough to us ?
39154	1	a	Well what about what you said , like putting the finger grips just on top of the plastic ?
39155	0	a	Yeah .
39156	0	a	Just just maybe
39157	0	a	yeah .
39158	0	a	Just a little bit of .
39159	0	a	Okay .
39160	0	a	So we would ,
39161	1	a	we would have the LCD screen ?
39162	0	a	Kay .
39163	1	a	as long as the pla the rubber is nowhere near the controls , yes .
39164	1	a	So I guess the case would be plastic ,
39165	0	a	with Perhaps that is not even enough rubber to qualify as being part of it .
39166	0	a	It is more of a su it is more of a supplement maybe .
39167	0	a	Yeah .
39168	0	a	M more of a l lamination perhaps .
39169	0	a	Yeah .
39170	0	a	So then for the scroll , are we going for the iPod type ?
39171	0	a	Yeah ?
39172	0	a	Yeah I think so .
39173	0	a	Which will require a more expensive chip on print right ?
39174	0	a	Kay .
39175	0	a	Yes .
39176	0	a	It does .
39177	0	a	So
39178	0	a	I guess that , is that , is that about it ?
39179	0	a	So we have a good idea of what we are going to need to to do on this ?
39180	0	a	okay so we will have another meeting in thirty minutes .
39181	0	a	Right .
39182	0	a	Here is what is going to be going on .
39183	0	a	Ryan you will be working on the user interface design .
39184	0	a	Manuel you will be working on the look and feel design .
39185	0	a	Corrine we will want a product evaluation .
39186	0	a	And the two of you get to play with the modelling components and maybe and and get us a prototype .
39187	0	a	Which should go along well with your look and feel design and your interface .
39188	0	a	So that
39189	0	a	basically just be working on the prototype , we will accomplish your other two actions .
39190	0	a	Alright .
39191	0	a	Okay .
39192	0	a	 
39193	0	a	Yep .
39194	0	a	Soon as I get this .
39195	0	a	Okay .
39196	0	a	This is our last meeting .
39197	1	a	I will go ahead and go through the minutes from the previous meeting .
39198	1	a	and then we will have a , the prototype presentation .
39199	1	a	then we will do an evaluation .
39200	1	a	or we will see what , what we need to have under the criteria for the evaluation .
39201	1	a	Then we will go through the finance and see if we fall within the budget .
39202	1	a	then we will do the evaluation , and then we can finish up after that with any changes that we will need to make ,
39203	0	a	or hopefully everything will fall right in line .
39204	0	a	let is see ,
39205	0	a	minutes from the last meeting .
39206	0	a	we looked at the the trends .
39207	0	a	We had the fashion trends that people want a fancy look and feel .
39208	0	a	It was twice as important as anything else .
39209	0	a	they liked fruit and vegetables in the new styles .
39210	0	a	and a spongy feel .
39211	0	a	So we were talking about trying to incorporate those into our prototype .
39212	0	a	they wanted limited buttons and simplicity .
39213	0	a	then we looked at the the method for coming up with our own remote .
39214	0	a	looking at other other devices .
39215	0	a	the iPod , we really liked the look of that .
39216	0	a	we also had the kid is remote for a simple idea .
39217	0	a	a two part remote , which was what were were originally looking at .
39218	0	a	and then there was talk of spee speech recognition becoming more predominant and easier to use .
39219	0	a	But I think we have still decided not to go with that .
39220	0	a	Then we looked at the components the materials for the case , the different energy sources , the different types of chips , and made a decision on what we were going to use to make our remote .
39221	0	a	and basically how ,
39222	0	a	what were making for the prototype .
39223	1	a	So I am going to leave it at that
39224	1	a	and let you guys take over .
39225	0	a	The prototype discussion .
39226	0	a	The prototype yeah .
39227	0	a	Do you need a this ?
39228	0	a	Okay .
39229	0	a	No .
39230	0	a	There is our remo the banana .
39231	0	a	Can try to plug that in there
39232	0	a	but
39233	0	a	Right .
39234	0	a	yeah
39235	0	a	basically we we st went with the colour yellow .
39236	0	a	working on the principle of a fruit which was mentioned , it is basically designed around a banana .
39237	0	a	but it would be held in such a fashion ,
39238	0	a	where it is ,
39239	0	a	obviously it would not be that floppy cause this would be hard plastic .
39240	0	a	These would be like the rubber , the rubber grips .
39241	0	a	So that is
39242	0	a	so that would hopefully help with grip , or like the ergonomics of it .
39243	0	a	but all the controlling would be done with this scroll wheel .
39244	0	a	You have to use your imagination a little bit .
39245	0	a	And this here represents the screen , where you , where you would go through .
39246	0	a	Very nice .
39247	0	a	And the the simplest functions would be almost identical to an iPod , where that one way ch through channels , that way th other way through channels .
39248	0	a	Volume up and down .
39249	0	a	And then to access the more complicated functions you would you sorta go , you press that and go through the menus .
39250	0	a	It is that that simple .
39251	0	a	That just represents the infrared beam .
39252	0	a	That is a simple on and off switch .
39253	0	a	I do not know ,
39254	1	a	we could use the voice .
39255	0	a	T that blue bits should be yellow , that that would be where the batteries would be I suppose .
39256	0	a	And
39257	0	a	that is about it .
39258	0	a	It is as simple as you , we could make it really .
39259	1	a	Is there anything you want to add ?
39260	0	a	Yeah .
39261	0	a	That is what we have there .
39262	0	a	That is plastic .
39263	0	a	Plastic covered with rubber .
39264	1	a	We might add some more underneath here .
39265	1	a	Maybe give it , give it a form .
39266	0	a	I mean you are supposed to hold it like that , but just if you grab it , take it from somewhere ,
39267	0	a	so yeah ,
39268	0	a	you have some rub
39269	0	a	yeah .
39270	0	a	Does not make much make much difference .
39271	0	a	You could work left handed or right handed I suppose .
39272	0	a	Exactly ,
39273	0	a	use both .
39274	1	a	Might as well think about Th think about the button as well .
39275	0	a	T the actual thing might be smaller .
39276	0	a	Yeah .
39277	1	a	Like either put either one one on either side or not do it at all .
39278	0	a	What but
39279	0	a	what is that button ?
39280	0	a	, kay .
39281	0	a	Just the on and off .
39282	0	a	It is a quick on off button .
39283	0	a	That is
39284	0	a	yeah
39285	0	a	I think it is pretty important .
39286	0	a	So you do not have to fiddle with that .
39287	0	a	Kay .
39288	0	a	Right ?
39289	0	a	that is not
39290	1	a	I would say a bit smaller would probably be nice .
39291	0	a	Yeah .
39292	1	a	You want to play with that over there .
39293	0	a	There you go .
39294	0	a	It is you know it is flimsy cause it is made out of heavy Play Doh ,
39295	0	a	but
39296	0	a	And whether or not it would fall into the cost everything I suppose .
39297	1	a	Would you like to
39298	0	a	Well done .
39299	0	a	Right .
39300	0	a	Pretty impressive .
39301	0	a	Kind of a banana .
39302	0	a	With the scroll and the LCD .
39303	0	a	Well luckily we are going to find out .
39304	0	a	Or not luckily .
39305	0	a	do you have a marketing presentation for us .
39306	0	a	I do .
39307	0	a	Okay .
39308	1	a	You guys are going to help me do an evaluation of the criteria .
39309	0	a	Okay .
39310	1	a	So first I will just discuss some of the criteria that I found .
39311	0	a	Just based on the past trend reports that I was looking at earlier .
39312	1	a	And then we will do a group evaluation of the prototype .
39313	1	a	And then we will calculate the average score to see how we did .
39314	0	a	so the criteria we are going to be looking at are the complaints that we heard from the users who were interviewed earlier .
39315	0	a	So
39316	0	a	we are going to be doing it based on a seven point scale .
39317	0	a	And one is going to mean true , that we did actually achieve that .
39318	0	a	With seven being false , we did not achieve that .
39319	0	a	Okay .
39320	0	a	So for the first one , we need to decide , did we solved the problem of the users who complained about an ugly remote ?
39321	0	a	I think it is definitely different than anything else out there .
39322	0	a	Yeah .
39323	0	a	So if they think that what is out there is ugly , then yes I would say , I would say most definitely .
39324	0	a	I would .
39325	0	a	It is bright .
39326	0	a	It is bright .
39327	0	a	It is
39328	0	a	It is curved .
39329	0	a	It still has your traditional black .
39330	0	a	It is not
39331	0	a	there is no sharp angles to it .
39332	0	a	Yep , not angular .
39333	0	a	I would say , when it comes to the ergonomics , the form and stuff , yes that is definitely more beautiful than your average .
39334	0	a	However the colour , we do not have a say in that .
39335	0	a	Yeah I think the colours detract a little bit .
39336	0	a	Some people might say it .
39337	0	a	That has been , that has been dictated pretty much by the company .
39338	0	a	Yeah .
39339	0	a	So to answer that honestly I would rather say like , we have not solved the problem completely with the ugly remote because the colour is ugly , definitely .
39340	0	a	That is true .
39341	0	a	Yep .
39342	0	a	Yeah .
39343	0	a	Yeah .
39344	0	a	Is nothing you can say about that .
39345	0	a	I mean I much prefer something like brushed chrome with that form .
39346	0	a	Yeah .
39347	0	a	But
39348	0	a	Right .
39349	0	a	Yeah something more modern to go
39350	0	a	a a modern colour to go with the modern form .
39351	0	a	Right .
39352	0	a	It is different .
39353	0	a	You do not want your three feet huge LCD dis display in your living room that is hanging from the wall to be controlled with something like that .
39354	0	a	okay so ,
39355	0	a	do you think , since we
39356	0	a	This was a a sign criteria , do you think maybe we should put it somewhere in the middle then ?
39357	0	a	Does that sound good ?
39358	0	a	What do you think ?
39359	0	a	Three ?
39360	0	a	Four ?
39361	0	a	Five ?
39362	0	a	Four is fair .
39363	0	a	Yeah .
39364	0	a	Yeah .
39365	0	a	Yeah .
39366	0	a	I would say four .
39367	0	a	Yeah .
39368	0	a	Okay .
39369	0	a	Very non committal , four .
39370	0	a	Okay ,
39371	0	a	the second one .
39372	0	a	Did we make it simple for new users ?
39373	0	a	One ,
39374	0	a	kay .
39375	0	a	It is very intuitive , I think yeah .
39376	0	a	Yeah .
39377	0	a	I think that was the main aim , one of the main aims that we had .
39378	1	a	S give it a one .
39379	0	a	Yeah .
39380	0	a	Okay .
39381	0	a	, do the controls now match the operating behaviour of the users ?
39382	0	a	I would say that
39383	0	a	So one ?
39384	0	a	Yeah ?
39385	0	a	Okay .
39386	0	a	yeah .
39387	0	a	Cause we have we have brought it down to basically four controls most common , which are channel and volume .
39388	0	a	Right .
39389	0	a	And then the other ones are just a matter of just going , just scrolling further .
39390	0	a	S scrolling through and selecting a few .
39391	0	a	Right .
39392	0	a	So that is a one .
39393	0	a	I think that is a one .
39394	0	a	Okay
39395	0	a	the fourth one .
39396	0	a	How about the problem of a remote being easily lost ?
39397	0	a	One of the number one complaints .
39398	0	a	Something that big and that yellow you just do not lose anymore .
39399	0	a	Yeah .
39400	0	a	Whether you want to or not , you are not going to lose it .
39401	0	a	It is bright yellow .
39402	0	a	Bright yellow is hard to lose .
39403	1	a	But if we were to , if we were , that , the speech recognition .
39404	1	a	That , we could maybe just use that solely for the the finding thing .
39405	0	a	That was what we would we would mentioned .
39406	0	a	So if we incorporate speech recognition into it then it could
39407	0	a	And it is quite bright
39408	0	a	and
39409	0	a	Yeah .
39410	0	a	Just just to use , to find it when it was lost .
39411	0	a	But like I said , like I do not think you would lose something so yellow so easily .
39412	0	a	Oops .
39413	0	a	And it is not going to fall , like a rectangle would slip down behind things .
39414	0	a	That is going to be a difficult shape to
39415	0	a	Yeah .
39416	0	a	Well what S
39417	1	a	Maybe in the middle again , three or four or something ?
39418	0	a	I mean you know loo losing things is one of those things that people can lose ,
39419	0	a	I mean a million ways .
39420	0	a	Okay .
39421	0	a	You can pick it up and walk away with it
39422	0	a	and then you have lost it .
39423	0	a	That is true .
39424	0	a	But if we do go with the , with the speech recognition , then it , then our scale goes up quite a bit I think .
39425	0	a	Oh yeah .
39426	0	a	Yeah .
39427	0	a	You probably
39428	0	a	Probably two .
39429	0	a	You know .
39430	0	a	If we eliminate the fact that you know it is impossible to guarantee that it is not going to be lost then
39431	0	a	I would say two .
39432	0	a	Yeah .
39433	0	a	With the speech recognition , which of course may be changed depending on budget .
39434	0	a	Yeah .
39435	1	a	Y you could add an extra feature actually .
39436	0	a	Which makes this thing raise hell when you remove it too far from the television .
39437	0	a	Yeah .
39438	0	a	We could add that
39439	0	a	but that is nothing we have thought of so far .
39440	0	a	Which , which may be cheaper than speech recognition if it were just a Some sort of proximity Pray that you do not accidentally lose that piece .
39441	0	a	Yes .
39442	0	a	Yeah true .
39443	0	a	But I mean d just those whistling , clapping key rings you have .
39444	0	a	Annoying alarm or something ?
39445	0	a	Yeah .
39446	0	a	It is it is
39447	0	a	the
39448	0	a	it is based on this anti anti theft technology for suitcases and stuff , where you have one piece that is attached to your luggage , another piece that starts beeping .
39449	0	a	They are cheap .
39450	0	a	So it ca not be that expensive .
39451	0	a	Yeah .
39452	0	a	That ca not cost much .
39453	0	a	Yeah .
39454	0	a	So that can also easily be integrated because these things are small enough to to hide , so you have one piece , you have to glue somewhere behind your stick it behind your TV and the other
39455	0	a	Right .
39456	0	a	stick it on the TV .
39457	0	a	That would be tough then .
39458	0	a	Well also your remote would alarm you if somebody stole
39459	0	a	you t your television , yeah .
39460	0	a	Ran off with it without taking the beautiful remote control .
39461	0	a	Yeah .
39462	0	a	So .
39463	1	a	Are we adding one of these two features ?
39464	0	a	going to say
39465	0	a	okay .
39466	1	a	Let is add one of those features and say yes .
39467	0	a	Okay .
39468	0	a	So we are back to a one ?
39469	0	a	Or a two ?
39470	0	a	Two , kay .
39471	0	a	Two .
39472	0	a	Two .
39473	0	a	Two .
39474	0	a	Okay .
39475	0	a	Are we technologically innovative ?
39476	0	a	From iPod
39477	0	a	yeah .
39478	0	a	It is all just
39479	0	a	It is all just stolen technology when it comes down to
39480	0	a	right right right right .
39481	0	a	I would say so .
39482	0	a	do not get many mo remote controls with screens on .
39483	0	a	Yeah it is stolen technology .
39484	0	a	It is
39485	0	a	But there is not a lot of yellow , there is not a lotta yellow .
39486	0	a	But we have .
39487	0	a	But for remotes
39488	0	a	yeah .
39489	0	a	Course that was not really
39490	0	a	we were kind of forced to take that colour .
39491	0	a	Fa
39492	0	a	cause it is stolen .
39493	0	a	Two ?
39494	0	a	Three ?
39495	0	a	But how many remotes do you see like this ?
39496	0	a	Not so many .
39497	0	a	I do not know that we are that innovative , to tell you the truth .
39498	0	a	No maybe not .
39499	0	a	Yeah not really .
39500	0	a	If we added the screaming factor then we go up .
39501	0	a	Right .
39502	0	a	I would say we are probably at four .
39503	0	a	Really ?
39504	0	a	Okay .
39505	0	a	That is going to hurt us .
39506	0	a	Okay .
39507	0	a	spongy material ?
39508	0	a	Kay .
39509	0	a	Yeah well you have that , kind of , sort of .
39510	0	a	We have some spongy , yeah .
39511	0	a	Yeah as much as as needed , I think .
39512	0	a	It is not a one though .
39513	0	a	No .
39514	0	a	One would be the whole thing to fold and stuff .
39515	0	a	Yeah .
39516	0	a	Because it is only got what , these parts are the grips and perhaps the back side the bottom the underneath on the back .
39517	0	a	Yeah .
39518	0	a	Yeah .
39519	0	a	So that is a four at most .
39520	0	a	Probably a four at most .
39521	0	a	And lastly ,
39522	0	a	did we put the fashion in electronics ?
39523	0	a	I would say we did .
39524	0	a	Possibly even a five .
39525	0	a	Y yes .
39526	0	a	Yeah .
39527	0	a	If your fashion is b is Carmen Miranda , you betcha .
39528	0	a	More
39529	0	a	Well the recent fashion is rather displayed in the in the LCD and the way you operate it than the form and the colour ,
39530	0	a	but it definitely is .
39531	0	a	Yeah .
39532	0	a	On the
39533	0	a	Yeah .
39534	0	a	It is true .
39535	0	a	Be what we were told , and they would say yeah , definitely .
39536	0	a	Kay .
39537	0	a	Alright .
39538	0	a	Now we just gotta calculate .
39539	0	a	Six eight twelve sixteen .
39540	0	a	Seventeen divided by s Eight .
39541	0	a	Seven is Two point
39542	0	a	two point four ?
39543	0	a	Something .
39544	0	a	Is that some long division ?
39545	0	a	No .
39546	0	a	Well I have not done math in years .
39547	0	a	What two I dunno .
39548	0	a	Just , I am sure there is a .
39549	0	a	Okay we will say two point four two .
39550	0	a	Right ?
39551	0	a	How does that look ?
39552	0	a	It is been a while .
39553	0	a	I am impressed .
39554	0	a	I ca not do that without a calculator .
39555	0	a	No I ca not do long
39556	0	a	very impressive .
39557	0	a	And what what is the acceptable criteria ?
39558	0	a	Is there like a scale that we have to hit ?
39559	0	a	Alright then .
39560	0	a	Oh no .
39561	0	a	They just told me to pick my own criteria and have you guys evaluate it basically .
39562	0	a	So that is that .
39563	0	a	Okay .
39564	0	a	Well , let is see .
39565	0	a	Now we get to do the budget numbers .
39566	0	a	You did not know that you were going to have a budget .
39567	0	a	But we do .
39568	0	a	Okay .
39569	0	a	Yeah .
39570	0	a	Yeah so .
39571	0	a	You would been going a long time dividing that .
39572	0	a	It is two point four two eight five se it just keeps going on .
39573	0	a	Oh my god .
39574	0	a	Okay .
39575	0	a	Two point four two basically .
39576	0	a	Yeah we will go with that .
39577	0	a	Not too shabby .
39578	0	a	So I have here an
39579	0	a	Yeah .
39580	0	a	Fifty percent , you are kidding .
39581	0	a	P
39582	0	a	It is too much .
39583	0	a	We want a fifty percent profit on this .
39584	0	a	Oh you ca not really see that very well .
39585	0	a	Charge about three hundred quid for it .
39586	0	a	Twelve and a half Euros is what supposed to cost us .
39587	0	a	Okay , so
39588	0	a	Well let is see .
39589	0	a	Battery .
39590	0	a	The f the
39591	0	a	Wonder if I can make this What the
39592	0	a	Oh it wo not let me do that .
39593	0	a	Okay .
39594	0	a	Alright so at top , I do not know if you guys can read that or not .
39595	0	a	I ca not cause I do not have my glasses on , but so we have got the energy source .
39596	0	a	There is four , five , six categories .
39597	0	a	We have energy source , electronics , case .
39598	0	a	Then we have case material supplements , interface type , and then button supplements .
39599	0	a	Okay so
39600	0	a	first of all energy source , we picked battery .
39601	0	a	and how many batteries do we think this will probably take ?
39602	0	a	Probably some e either two or four .
39603	0	a	Two .
39604	0	a	Two ?
39605	0	a	Like it .
39606	0	a	At four it is going to be too heavy ,
39607	0	a	so that that is not our problem .
39608	0	a	People can change it every month .
39609	0	a	They wo not know until after they bought it .
39610	0	a	Excellent .
39611	0	a	This is consumerism .
39612	0	a	Alright
39613	0	a	so
39614	0	a	for the electronics our choices are simpl simple chip on print , regular chip on print , advanced chip on print , sample sensor , sample speaker .
39615	0	a	We are advanced chip are we ?
39616	0	a	Yeah yeah .
39617	0	a	That is the advanced chip on print , yeah .
39618	0	a	Kay ,
39619	0	a	we have one of those .
39620	0	a	Kay then the case is a Probably it is double curved .
39621	0	a	Double curved , yes .
39622	0	a	Case materials are
39623	0	a	plastic .
39624	0	a	Plastic .
39625	0	a	I guess it is two , since one for the top , one for the bottom .
39626	0	a	N no .
39627	0	a	Is that right or is it just one ?
39628	0	a	Maybe it is one because of the
39629	0	a	Kay .
39630	0	a	No that is just one .
39631	0	a	It is just one mo single mould , we can do that .
39632	0	a	Right .
39633	0	a	I guess it does not matter cause the price on that one is zero ,
39634	0	a	which is nice .
39635	0	a	Exactly , right .
39636	0	a	Oh .
39637	0	a	Special colour ?
39638	0	a	Interface type .
39639	0	a	That is not a special colour .
39640	0	a	Bright yellow .
39641	0	a	It is a specially ugly colour , but it is not special .
39642	0	a	We have pushbutton , scroll wheel interface , integrated scroll wheel pushbutton , and an LCD display .
39643	0	a	S
39644	0	a	That is
39645	0	a	Yeah .
39646	0	a	S
39647	0	a	Yes unfortunately .
39648	0	a	So we actually have the LCD display
39649	0	a	and then is it the integrated or is it
39650	0	a	Yeah .
39651	0	a	And then
39652	0	a	I would say the integrated .
39653	0	a	Kay .
39654	0	a	Button supplement ?
39655	0	a	Special colour ?
39656	0	a	special form ?
39657	0	a	Special material .
39658	1	a	We could of course make the buttons wood .
39659	1	a	Say mahogany or so
39660	0	a	or titanium .
39661	0	a	It would look really lovely .
39662	1	a	Or titanium .
39663	0	a	Yeah .
39664	0	a	They cost us all the same .
39665	0	a	remote control .
39666	0	a	just
39667	0	a	Yeah that is too much .
39668	0	a	Well we only have one button so really we should not be charged , we should not be charged anything for the the button supplements .
39669	0	a	No
39670	0	a	that is getting a bit tiny .
39671	0	a	Okay .
39672	0	a	Yeah .
39673	1	a	I would ignore that .
39674	1	a	Leave it blank .
39675	0	a	We are going to leave that one blank because we run on a LCD and scroll .
39676	0	a	So our total is fifteen point five .
39677	0	a	Which I believe is by three Euros over .
39678	0	a	It is hard to believe .
39679	1	a	So we will go for the hand dynamo huh ?
39680	0	a	I mean let is let is face it ,
39681	0	a	it also depends on the software on the on the television .
39682	0	a	So the only thing better than a banana shaped remote is one that you shake .
39683	0	a	If it w
39684	1	a	What if we completely took out the the one single button we have got on .
39685	1	a	And just had a scroll wheel interface .
39686	1	a	And the LCD display .
39687	0	a	I suppose the LCD C display is the one that is pushing it up a bit though .
39688	0	a	Yeah
39689	0	a	cause the
39690	0	a	Well cause we have to have both right ?
39691	0	a	Yeah .
39692	0	a	Yeah .
39693	0	a	You can have the the information that this thing transmits be being displayed on the on the screen .
39694	1	a	So s yeah let is take away the
39695	0	a	Yeah .
39696	0	a	Yeah
39697	1	a	you could maybe take out the LCD dis display even ,
39698	0	a	if it if it comes up on the computer itsel on the TV itself .
39699	0	a	Yeah .
39700	0	a	Right .
39701	0	a	So we may not need the LCD display ?
39702	0	a	Well there we go .
39703	0	a	that is possible yeah .
39704	0	a	Right .
39705	0	a	We may not need it .
39706	0	a	There you go .
39707	0	a	Perfect .
39708	0	a	There we go .
39709	0	a	Twelve point five .
39710	0	a	Perfect .
39711	0	a	Okay .
39712	0	a	So we just remove our screen here .
39713	0	a	Screen .
39714	1	a	Make it a bigger dial .
39715	0	a	Easier to use .
39716	0	a	Even easier to use then .
39717	0	a	Besides look at what the LCD does to our lovely remote .
39718	0	a	Okay , the
39719	1	a	So we can just take away a heck of a lot of the
39720	0	a	there you go .
39721	0	a	Back to the design room boys .
39722	0	a	What is the blue part ?
39723	0	a	Oh that is the batteries .
39724	0	a	central ?
39725	0	a	Oh that is just
39726	0	a	yeah .
39727	0	a	That was just
39728	0	a	we ran out of yellow .
39729	0	a	Okay .
39730	0	a	There you go .
39731	0	a	There you go .
39732	0	a	Oops .
39733	0	a	Even simpler .
39734	0	a	Looks more like a banana .
39735	0	a	Yeah .
39736	0	a	For all those fruit lovers out there .
39737	0	a	There you go .
39738	0	a	One more criteria .
39739	0	a	Okay so
39740	0	a	the costs under twelve point five Euro .
39741	0	a	Was no .
39742	0	a	We redesigned it .
39743	0	a	Yeah .
39744	0	a	Now it is yes .
39745	0	a	Next slide .
39746	0	a	Project evaluation .
39747	0	a	project process , satisfaction with , for example , room for creativity , leadership , teamwork , means , new ideas found .
39748	0	a	So
39749	0	a	I guess that
39750	0	a	Let is see here .
39751	0	a	I think that perhaps the project evaluation is just supposed to be completed by me .
39752	0	a	But I would like to hear your thoughts .
39753	0	a	Trying to fill in some time there .
39754	0	a	Fair enough .
39755	0	a	h what did you think of our project process ?
39756	0	a	Good .
39757	0	a	I think we did
39758	0	a	yeah
39759	0	a	I think we did quite well .
39760	0	a	Great .
39761	0	a	Yeah .
39762	0	a	Yeah .
39763	0	a	Good teamwork .
39764	0	a	Just half a day , you have a remote .
39765	0	a	There you go .
39766	0	a	Right from the start of the day .
39767	0	a	Yeah I think
39768	0	a	we st we started off a little little weak .
39769	0	a	We sort of knew where we were going straight away I thought .
39770	0	a	Our leadership was quite weak in the beginning .
39771	0	a	But as the day went along we had more idea of what we were doing .
39772	0	a	room for creativity ?
39773	0	a	There was that .
39774	0	a	I think we tried a lotta different things
39775	0	a	and I think it was interesting as you guys brought up more information and studies that we were right on with a lot of those things .
39776	0	a	you guys worked together well as a team .
39777	0	a	And the means ?
39778	0	a	Which was the whiteboard and the pens .
39779	0	a	Yeah .
39780	0	a	We have used the whiteboard .
39781	0	a	Super super .
39782	0	a	I had some problem with the pen I think ,
39783	0	a	but minus your p
39784	0	a	Well Have a
39785	0	a	we have a list of employees that you would like fired .
39786	0	a	Minus your PowerPoint fiasco .
39787	0	a	Well that is not my fault .
39788	0	a	That is obviously the people I work for that work for me ,
39789	0	a	they have just you know
39790	0	a	Heads are going to roll , believe me .
39791	0	a	No I know .
39792	0	a	I am
39793	0	a	yeah .
39794	0	a	Incom
39795	0	a	Yes yes .
39796	0	a	Okay .
39797	0	a	N new ideas found ?
39798	0	a	Yes for the remote .
39799	0	a	Kinda .
39800	0	a	Maybe no not f for technology .
39801	0	a	Technology used .
39802	0	a	Alright .
39803	0	a	Closing .
39804	0	a	Costs are within the budget .
39805	0	a	Project is evaluated .
39806	0	a	complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary .
39807	0	a	That is it .
39808	1	a	And I still have to do my minutes for the last meeting .
39809	0	a	Actually .
39810	0	a	so there will probably be another questionnaire coming up .
39811	1	a	And then we will have to check with the main boss whether we can , what goes on after that .
39812	0	a	 
39813	0	a	Okay .
39814	0	a	And do not forget the
39815	0	a	I have a copy .
39816	0	a	Oh yeah .
39817	0	a	, so hi everyone .
39818	0	a	Thanks for coming to this meeting .
39819	0	a	well as you all know the topic of this morning is meeting is the fact that we are moving and we are going to get more space .
39820	0	a	So that is a very good piece of news .
39821	0	a	but we also have to find out how we use this space .
39822	1	a	So if you want , I will just give a brief overview of what is happening
39823	1	a	and then we can talk about , well , arranging these new the new office space .
39824	1	a	So in case you have not seen the the documents let me just show you very briefly the the configuration of the the space .
39825	0	a	So well , there is nothing much to say .
39826	0	a	Well you know how many of us are are present and you know that we are a bit tight actually in our present location .
39827	0	a	that is why actually the university finally allocated us this this part of the Unimail building .
39828	0	a	So it is at the sixth floor .
39829	0	a	And it is sort of contiguous rooms as you you can all see from from here .
39830	0	a	so the the the one P , two P , three P means the the number of persons .
39831	0	a	As you can see we have several corridor with a number of of of rooms , of one person rooms , two person room and and three person rooms .
39832	0	a	actually I think Agnes did this nice drawing
39833	0	a	so she even put the the view , so we have the old town on one side , and the mountains on the other two sides .
39834	0	a	we have some bathrooms for us .
39835	0	a	and a courtyard which actually means a sort of shaft , because the court is down at the first floor .
39836	1	a	Andre , just , yeah , just a a clarification question ,
39837	0	a	are they number of people per room indicated strict , or can we play around with ?
39838	0	a	I mean if there are two people , is it really that you ca not put three or two and a half or how how was it calculated ?
39839	0	a	Kay .
39840	0	a	Well , it is a bit difficult to say , because in fact we have some constraints in terms of furniture .
39841	0	a	they are here .
39842	0	a	So well , your your person Your your question actually is answered maybe by the third item .
39843	0	a	So each person should get , well , it is a sort of desk , it is made of two pieces and it looks like a corner .
39844	0	a	With , of course , a chair .
39845	0	a	a filing cabinet that goes under the desk
39846	1	a	and , well , we can put hanging shelves over the the desks .
39847	0	a	So I am not really sure it is possible to get three three desks in a two person office .
39848	1	a	But we could try .
39849	0	a	What is What should be said here , I do not know if , well , you
39850	1	a	I I will maybe distribute now documents if you do not have them .
39851	0	a	Maybe it is easier .
39852	0	a	Do you need something , Martin ?
39853	1	a	, I can keep this for you .
39854	0	a	I have everything .
39855	0	a	Okay , so
39856	0	a	Are you sure of that ?
39857	0	a	so it is it is
39858	0	a	Yeah ,
39859	0	a	you have a copy , Susan .
39860	0	a	You too David , I think .
39861	0	a	So in fact there are more places than people , so we wo not be that constrained .
39862	0	a	as you know some of us and some of you here actually , Martin and David are part time .
39863	0	a	So it it is for the moment quite comfortable .
39864	0	a	Normally we should even get an extra an extra place for , you know , temporary people coming to work on on projects .
39865	0	a	yeah ,
39866	0	a	I
39867	0	a	yeah ,
39868	0	a	I counted
39869	0	a	so we have fifteen pers physical persons and about sixteen , I think , persons
39870	0	a	oh , actually , eighteen persons in the offices .
39871	0	a	Two Six seven eight nine ten eleven
39872	0	a	twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen .
39873	0	a	Yeah ,
39874	0	a	but counting the rea the the reading room .
39875	0	a	Exactly ,
39876	0	a	it so one of the issues here , it is probably not on the slides , is that we would like to have , unlike what had until now , a lounge or reading room in one of the the offices .
39877	0	a	So in one of the rooms .
39878	0	a	Do we really need that ?
39879	0	a	Okay .
39880	0	a	, I think quite a lot of people e expressed the need for that .
39881	0	a	So if we could do it , then I think it would be much nicer .
39882	0	a	let me also st say something
39883	0	a	Yep .
39884	0	a	And Susan , do not forget the time we spend to for discussions about that room , so you should be able to valorize this if possible .
39885	0	a	Yeah , I I think so .
39886	0	a	But I still agree with you that the b the we are not so we are not so large , as far as space is concerned .
39887	0	a	Yeah .
39888	0	a	because fifteen people to put in there eighteen positions ,
39889	1	a	so to the best if you take two people room for the reading room , then you have sixteen places .
39890	0	a	Well , sixteen slots for fifteen people .
39891	0	a	So it is still should be feasible .
39892	0	a	Yeah , that that also means that the growth will be zero .
39893	0	a	That is
39894	0	a	Yeah ,
39895	0	a	I think that is quite important to manage some space .
39896	1	a	Maybe we can think of , yeah , some two or three , yeah , for visiting people .
39897	1	a	Visiting visiti visiting researchers , students coming for exchange students et cetera .
39898	0	a	Correct .
39899	0	a	Yeah .
39900	1	a	Okay , so let me finish with the the constraints which are almost done .
39901	0	a	So we also need to to find the a spot for the photocopier , the fax machine , and the printer .
39902	0	a	The fax , you know , is very small , but the photocopier is quite huge , and the printer is well ab this size .
39903	0	a	okay ,
39904	0	a	the offices comes with white boards .
39905	0	a	Not very very important .
39906	0	a	the furniture that w each each person has and you have a list of people .
39907	0	a	So the thing you you ought to know is that we are not the only ones that w we are thin that that are thinking about for well , about putting people i in these rooms .
39908	0	a	there is another group that is also having discussions .
39909	0	a	So the idea is that today we will just try to f
39910	0	a	start seeing the main constraints and then you have time to to go and think about it
39911	1	a	ask the people you know , your assistants , for instance , and at the next meeting we will try to to come with one solution .
39912	0	a	, the other group will also propose a solution and then there will be another negotiation .
39913	0	a	if i if we do not get these ?
39914	0	a	, well basically they are promised to us so
39915	0	a	Do do you think there are chances that they take from us one of the rooms or
39916	0	a	Yeah ,
39917	0	a	I
39918	0	a	I
39919	0	a	I think it is , yeah .
39920	0	a	And if we do not get this space then what happens ?
39921	0	a	These , yeah .
39922	0	a	We j we stay where we are .
39923	0	a	Okay .
39924	0	a	No the the the chances might be that there are more people to put in that space .
39925	0	a	Yeah i yeah ,
39926	0	a	that is one of the the problems .
39927	1	a	I think maybe we should take this into account and maybe think of some of the bigger rooms with four people ,
39928	0	a	one being temporary or or part time .
39929	1	a	okay , so maybe we could try to to see now what would be the main options .
39930	0	a	Say the general , well , arrangement options .
39931	1	a	Do you think that we should put people , say , according to projects for instance ?
39932	0	a	In in the table that that we have , we also have the the p the main projects on which the people are working .
39933	0	a	So how
39934	0	a	Yeah .
39935	0	a	Andre , sorry for interrupting ,
39936	1	a	but one again clarification question ,
39937	0	a	what is the real margin of manoeuvre that we have for these discussions ,
39938	0	a	because at least we are half per cent fifty per cent of from EPFL and sometimes you have meetings where w y the the decision is already taken , so you can spend quite a lot of time discussing things ,
39939	0	a	so what what will be the impact of what we will come out come up with ?
39940	0	a	So , another way of a
39941	0	a	Another way of asking the question , is there any other group already working on on the how this should be should be allocated ?
39942	0	a	Or are we the the one that is supposed to do the p the the p position for it ?
39943	0	a	But wha why why do not they have any representative here .
39944	0	a	Oh , actually what is fixed is the n the number of rooms .
39945	0	a	This we cannot really change .
39946	0	a	I mean at least not us , it would be much more difficult to get another another room for instance .
39947	0	a	But what is absolutely n not fixed is the arrangement of the people in the rooms .
39948	0	a	So basically we are all the permutations are possible at the moment .
39949	0	a	Well , what we are looking for is a solution that suits everyone and that makes the maximum of people happy .
39950	0	a	So the other group is , I do not think we have to see them as competitors , but they are just trying to to find another local optimum .
39951	0	a	Or l
39952	0	a	Yeah .
39953	0	a	I mean
39954	0	a	Yeah ,
39955	0	a	why do we do it separately ?
39956	0	a	Okay .
39957	0	a	Yeah ,
39958	0	a	why did not we have a meeting together ?
39959	0	a	Well , certainly we have to ask Pierrette and and Maggie , since they are not here , because they also have a lot of students that they have to see as we do , and so that is another consideration , too .
39960	0	a	, they have another group and then Andre and Agnes will discuss about it with .
39961	0	a	You are the rep representative of this group actually .
39962	0	a	Yeah we
39963	0	a	Yeah .
39964	0	a	I
39965	0	a	I think that is
39966	0	a	Yeah , there is no real competition between the two , but we will just try to find at least two solutions and see how how close they are , actually .
39967	0	a	It is it is
39968	0	a	I think well the m the people who who decided this thought it was the best solution to , well , you know , find two two kinds of opinions .
39969	0	a	Yeah .
39970	0	a	Well , we could have been eight h sitting around here and and talking ,
39971	0	a	but I think it is it is more difficult .
39972	0	a	No ,
39973	0	a	but you know that that is a standard thing .
39974	0	a	It is
39975	0	a	Suppose that somebody for some strange reasons want to be in the corner and we do not know about that , we will put them put her or him somewhere else , then we will do plenty of work for nothing , because we will not have this constraint .
39976	0	a	We will not be aware of this constraint .
39977	0	a	Well
39978	0	a	Exactly ,
39979	0	a	I think
39980	0	a	So so today the goal is not to to find the solution today , but to set some constraints and then go and see the people and find out if they have any preferences .
39981	0	a	Oh , okay .
39982	0	a	Okay .
39983	0	a	Obviously we wo not be able to accommodate all the the preferences , but at least we will find the most the most important ones .
39984	0	a	P s
39985	0	a	I think
39986	0	a	Yeah .
39987	0	a	Yeah .
39988	0	a	Yeah ,
39989	0	a	I think so that is one of the things I think we know that they have students , we do not know exactly if they prefer for instance to be alone , or to well , to be with their assistant , or even with another person working on the project .
39990	1	a	So that would have been maybe , yeah
39991	1	a	, another solution is to ask everyone to provide an arrangement ,
39992	0	a	but I think that is a bit a bit hard then to to work out .
39993	1	a	so since all of you have a copy of the , well , of the drawing , I think for the next time , m maybe you could come with a concrete proposal with names on it .
39994	0	a	But let us try to see today whether we prefer to organise people , say , by projects or just professor and assistant .
39995	0	a	So what would be f , say , first your preferences ,
39996	0	a	since
39997	1	a	Let is let is start with us , maybe today .
39998	0	a	what do you think about it ?
39999	0	a	Would you prefer to be alone , would you prefer to be with your assistant .
40000	0	a	You who are part time , do you think you can come here on a very w well regular schedule or is it part time , but variable during the week ?
40001	0	a	Uh huh .
40002	1	a	Yeah , okay ,
40003	0	a	me personally I would like to to to share the other peopl n the room with assistants as when you have problems of normal life , like the printer does not work , I do not want to ask this to my supervisor , so it is better to to be with a with an assistant to share the room .
40004	0	a	And since you are coming on the half time , do you think you will be able to group your presence here , say Monday , Tuesday and Wednesday morning , or is it going to be m much more random ?
40005	0	a	Okay .
40006	0	a	What I do not think it is a good idea to share t to ha to share the same desk .
40007	0	a	I still would like to have my drawers and these things .
40008	0	a	Yeah , I think so too .
40009	0	a	so Martin , you are also half time
40010	0	a	and , well , the third person is Gisella .
40011	0	a	I think it is quite clear that each person should have their own desk and
40012	0	a	Yeah .
40013	0	a	I agree with that .
40014	0	a	That is
40015	0	a	Whe whe where part time is important is that it is n an overlo load on a room , so for sure if you have a part time person , it reduces the the ranges of time where too many people in the room .
40016	0	a	It is no no way we we could put two persons at the same desk .
40017	0	a	Yeah ,
40018	0	a	I think grouping
40019	1	a	As far as I am concerned I probably might be able to have a kind of a regular presence here .
40020	0	a	, the the thing that f in my case has to be taken into account is that I will have a lot of phone calls .
40021	0	a	So I will be talking
40022	0	a	o o o over the phone all the time .
40023	0	a	Oh great .
40024	0	a	So that is not necessary
40025	0	a	Well , it depends on
40026	0	a	I I have nothing against sharing a a an office with somebody .
40027	0	a	I d already did it before , so
40028	0	a	and it was perfectly fine .
40029	1	a	It just has to be somebody who can work while somebody else is having phone calls in the in the room , which is very d much dependent on people .
40030	0	a	Some people are not disturb at all by this .
40031	0	a	Some people just ca not work .
40032	0	a	Are you disturbed by the phone calls of other people ?
40033	0	a	Okay .
40034	0	a	I am not .
40035	0	a	But and what might happen , but it it will not be so heavy here at ISSCO is visitors .
40036	0	a	So that I will have more at EPFL , typically students coming in or asking for things .
40037	0	a	As I am not teaching here , I am teaching at EPFL , this should should not be a such a big load .
40038	0	a	So for me it it will be essentially I will not be I will not be able to be silent in the room , because I will be communicating also through vocal means , so
40039	1	a	before talking more about individual preferences , is there any possibility , what they have done in the faculty of law , for example , that they actually split rooms ?
40040	1	a	And so we would take one of the two people rooms and split it .
40041	0	a	And you would see that you would have the same size office , but that would give the privacy .
40042	0	a	Yeah .
40043	0	a	insofar as in just about every other faculty in the building , every professor has their own office .
40044	0	a	And it is it is really
40045	0	a	it goes a bit far that we have to have this all this sharing .
40046	1	a	So one option and that but that we would need to ask about if we could split one of the rooms
40047	0	a	That does not really solve it
40048	0	a	I mean there is there is really a difference to having to have your own
40049	0	a	Yeah ,
40050	0	a	and sometimes you have you need to have private discussions with somebody or whatever ,
40051	0	a	so
40052	0	a	Well , I I think it is really a matter of personal preference .
40053	1	a	Do you go for boxes for instance ?
40054	1	a	In the in the bigger rooms where ,
40055	1	a	yeah
40056	1	a	You know like cubicles ?
40057	1	a	Yeah
40058	1	a	Like cubicles .
40059	0	a	You mean , you really want to have walls .
40060	0	a	Four walls .
40061	0	a	Yeah .
40062	0	a	Yeah , sure sure .
40063	1	a	Yeah ,
40064	1	a	I
40065	1	a	I
40066	1	a	I will try to find out whether we can separate .
40067	0	a	I think for the moment the answer at least is no , because it is not only , well , making a wall , but also b making a new door .
40068	0	a	So it is quite a lot of of work ,
40069	1	a	but I will try to find this out for the next time .
40070	1	a	, so at least for the moment , as you can see there are I can show them here on the screen .
40071	0	a	So there are these two rooms on the left that accommodate one person .
40072	1	a	So at least some of the professors , since you are four , could could go well , could take these these rooms .
40073	0	a	Yeah .
40074	0	a	And quite a lot of rooms with two persons .
40075	0	a	how do you feel Susan about the professor sharing the room with her assistants or the one which is the most involved in in the teaching ?
40076	0	a	As you know , I prefer to have my own office .
40077	0	a	, I also have a lot of phone calls and y you know , have to see people , and with the other work that I am doing with the rectorate , that is really confidential information that I am treating .
40078	0	a	Yeah .
40079	0	a	So I
40080	0	a	That I have to be really careful about too .
40081	0	a	Yeah .
40082	0	a	But it is a personal preference .
40083	0	a	Insofar as what we have had up until now , both Maggie and Pierrette have been happy to share with others .
40084	1	a	So I mean I think that we should still check with them
40085	0	a	Well , not sharing with each other .
40086	0	a	I fully agree with that .
40087	0	a	That is it is much easier to me to to foresee having two people of the same position sharing a room , than
40088	0	a	Oh sharing with their students .
40089	0	a	They each share with an assistant .
40090	0	a	Yeah .
40091	0	a	Oh sorry ,
40092	0	a	because but that that is it is it is tricky because of confidentiality reasons , as you said .
40093	0	a	Yeah .
40094	0	a	Yeah , you you you are discussing a budget on the on the project , you over the phone typically you do not necessary want to have somebody who will be dependent on that budget being part of the discussion , so
40095	0	a	No .
40096	0	a	Paid on that
40097	0	a	Yeah , that is that is true .
40098	0	a	, okay .
40099	1	a	, maybe we could s look a bit at the projects .
40100	0	a	Do you think it is a good idea to put together in the same room as much as possible people from the same project ,
40101	0	a	since they talk quite a lot of to each other ?
40102	0	a	No ,
40103	0	a	because pro project does not last in time .
40104	0	a	They will change .
40105	0	a	That is what
40106	0	a	The only thing that will not or that will change only progressively in time is the status of the people .
40107	0	a	Okay .
40108	0	a	Well , yeah ,
40109	0	a	and some of the PHD students will hopefully finish their PHD at some point .
40110	0	a	Yeah ,
40111	0	a	they will promote that .
40112	0	a	But still , th some things
40113	0	a	Well ,
40114	0	a	yeah .
40115	0	a	Yeah , and also some of our the people mentioned here are working on more than one project too .
40116	0	a	Yeah .
40117	0	a	So For example , Marianne de , she is also working with me on the virtual campus project ,
40118	0	a	so she
40119	0	a	that one was not mentioned , but I am not saying that I necessarily want to be with her in the office , but it is just to say people are working on sometimes more than one project
40120	0	a	Yeah .
40121	0	a	Uh huh .
40122	0	a	Okay , yeah .
40123	1	a	If if it if i if projects are what you have in mind , I think that meeting room is the the tool for that .
40124	0	a	If you need to have people in a projects talking together , they just have a meeting room
40125	0	a	if it is not too far away then then it is a very good good practice .
40126	0	a	Yeah .
40127	0	a	Yep .
40128	0	a	Yeah .
40129	0	a	Well , actually , so the lounge could serve as some kind of meeting room ,
40130	0	a	but there are also more formal meeting rooms available in in the building , as we now know .
40131	0	a	Yes .
40132	0	a	That is why I was quite receptive to Susan is remark at the beginning is I would not formulate it in a such a an extreme way as , do we really need the lounge ?
40133	0	a	But I would p probably formulate it in the way that , do we want to have only a lounge or s something that can be used only as a reading room ?
40134	0	a	Because because meeting rooms to me are very important tools to do collaborative work .
40135	0	a	But on the other hand we also have to relax , so that is
40136	0	a	Yes .
40137	0	a	So I think we need a
40138	0	a	Yeah ,
40139	1	a	and and I think also we need a separate discussion on the furnishing of the lounge ,
40140	0	a	which is a whole other topic .
40141	0	a	Well , yeah ,
40142	1	a	we will skip that for now .
40143	0	a	Yes .
40144	0	a	No
40145	0	a	I d
40146	0	a	the lounge okay ,
40147	1	a	but I think we need to also see it as a overflow place when we have visitors for any length of time , so they actually have a place to work .
40148	0	a	Yeah .
40149	0	a	Yeah .
40150	0	a	Cause that is really my one of my worries with the plan that we have here is that it is it pr provides no possible possibilities of expansion .
40151	0	a	Uh huh .
40152	0	a	And this will happen .
40153	0	a	Yeah , yeah ,
40154	0	a	for the moment actually I think only one slot would be fully free .
40155	0	a	I mean you ca not you ca not prevent having visitors .
40156	0	a	And you should not .
40157	0	a	No ,
40158	0	a	you want to have visitors .
40159	0	a	Yeah .
40160	0	a	that is
40161	0	a	Yeah .
40162	0	a	Which for for fifteen people it is not enough .
40163	0	a	Yeah ,
40164	0	a	that means one visitor at a time .
40165	0	a	I mean Yeah it is
40166	0	a	We have we have four professors here and and and two researchers .
40167	0	a	Yeah .
40168	0	a	Or one intern .
40169	0	a	Yeah , that is .
40170	0	a	It is
40171	0	a	It is funny that we move to another building because we run out of space and we will have the same problem .
40172	0	a	Yes ,
40173	0	a	but we have more space here than what we currently have ,
40174	0	a	so it is at least some
40175	0	a	okay .
40176	0	a	Yeah ,
40177	0	a	it is already in progress .
40178	0	a	It is bad it is bad .
40179	0	a	And you are you are working
40180	0	a	I think , yeah , w
40181	0	a	Okay ,
40182	1	a	so one of the things I have to do for the next time is fin find out about the separations between rooms and
40183	0	a	Yeah ,
40184	0	a	I think it is quite a heavy transformation of the building .
40185	0	a	Because this is really related with security regulation as well .
40186	0	a	I mean you ca not just put walls in in rooms without any specific authoris
40187	0	a	Yeah .
40188	0	a	it is not necessary heavy in terms of work .
40189	0	a	It is heavy in terms of administrative authorisation .
40190	0	a	And okay ,
40191	1	a	I will try to find out .
40192	0	a	At least at EPFL .
40193	1	a	And the other question is , can we squeeze maybe four people in the or at least four places in the three three P room ?
40194	0	a	Yeah ,
40195	0	a	hopefully visitors do not need as much say filing space , or
40196	0	a	Yeah , they do not have that many papers .
40197	0	a	I think so .
40198	0	a	If you organise the desks in a in a intelligent way .
40199	0	a	Yep .
40200	0	a	Yeah , right , that is the point .
40201	0	a	okay .
40202	0	a	So that is I have to to ask ,
40203	0	a	so you do not really feel very strongly attached to this grouping by projects idea ?
40204	0	a	No .
40205	0	a	No .
40206	0	a	No ,
40207	1	a	because they can share their ideas across the project ,
40208	1	a	yeah , I would say .
40209	0	a	Yeah , exactly .
40210	0	a	Coffee machines are that made for that .
40211	0	a	But usually , whe when new assistants come , they would like to share the room with someone that knows l it is related with the project ,
40212	0	a	so he can
40213	0	a	No ,
40214	0	a	that is that is proximity does not play a big role there .
40215	0	a	We can discuss with people that
40216	0	a	the the space is very small ,
40217	0	a	I mean , altogether it is
40218	0	a	And you do not y
40219	0	a	you do not need to discuss about the projects , you f more need about th to discuss about where is the printer , how do I get furniture ,
40220	0	a	I am I do not have a a pencil , where is the the box with the pencils , and so on .
40221	0	a	Yeah , they they can change .
40222	0	a	No , okay .
40223	0	a	This is not project related .
40224	0	a	No ,
40225	0	a	and if you look now at their the the current division of the offices , for example , Bruno and Agnes are sharing an office and they are working on totally different projects and and they are they are just fine with that .
40226	0	a	Yeah .
40227	1	a	Yeah , I think that is that is going to be one of the the main things we will have to ask is whether people have strong preferences either in staying with someone or in not staying .
40228	0	a	, are you aware f of any strong constraints right now ?
40229	0	a	Oh .
40230	0	a	Well , there there were , but they sort of disappeared as of October when the no smoking rule came in , because before we were grouping the smokers and now that there is no smoking
40231	0	a	, I guess that is not very important option , though
40232	1	a	Well , except for that maybe you do not even want anybody smoking on your balcony , so
40233	0	a	No .
40234	0	a	Yeah , that is true .
40235	0	a	Okay ,
40236	0	a	yeah , that is true .
40237	0	a	So smoking is now no longer a constraint .
40238	0	a	Yeah .
40239	0	a	Is it allowed to smoke inside an office , if it is a one person
40240	0	a	No , not any more .
40241	0	a	No .
40242	0	a	No ,
40243	0	a	n it is in in principle
40244	0	a	it is a it is a no smoking building .
40245	0	a	It is non smoking campus .
40246	0	a	You can smoke outside .
40247	0	a	So you can go outside onto the balcony to smoke .
40248	0	a	Not even in the cafeteria ?
40249	0	a	Downstairs ?
40250	0	a	Okay .
40251	0	a	Not even in the cafeteria .
40252	0	a	No .
40253	0	a	Full no smoking building for all of the six thousand students .
40254	0	a	Yeah .
40255	0	a	That is the new regulation .
40256	0	a	Wow .
40257	1	a	On the roof maybe .
40258	0	a	on the balcony , actually .
40259	0	a	Yeah .
40260	0	a	The balcony , okay .
40261	0	a	Yep .
40262	0	a	Yeah .
40263	0	a	Normally .
40264	0	a	There is the there is that terrace .
40265	0	a	But Andre , just a
40266	0	a	Still some places where smokers can survive .
40267	0	a	Wow ,
40268	0	a	there there is no place in inside the building ?
40269	0	a	Wow ,
40270	0	a	ETPFL is a c it is a non smoking campus , but there are some places tha
40271	0	a	Yeah
40272	0	a	yeah
40273	0	a	yeah .
40274	0	a	No .
40275	1	a	But Andre , just a comment abou about your your previous request .
40276	0	a	Yeah .
40277	0	a	I I do not think that anyone will provide you information such as who does not want to be with whom .
40278	0	a	That is a typical output of ex research in expert systems .
40279	0	a	These are the rules that you never get .
40280	0	a	But you can get them through a proposal .
40281	0	a	The other way .
40282	1	a	So you propose a set up , where people are with other peoples and they will find politically correct ways to tell you that they do not want to have a view on the mountains , but they prefer to have view on the old town , so they would be in the toilets .
40283	1	a	O on the toilets or
40284	1	a	They would p prefer to be in another room .
40285	0	a	No ,
40286	0	a	we we do have one constraint that is difficult , which is Gisella , because when she is there she is very noisy .
40287	0	a	Yeah .
40288	0	a	Yeah .
40289	0	a	Yeah .
40290	0	a	She is on the phone a lot
40291	0	a	It is just it is by
40292	0	a	Yeah .
40293	0	a	But that is a sec s
40294	0	a	that is the admin that is the admin so it is part of the work .
40295	0	a	It is by nat by the nature of her work that a lot of it is communication .
40296	0	a	Yeah .
40297	0	a	Yes , Martin said also for him and , yeah , especially for her .
40298	0	a	Yeah .
40299	0	a	Yep .
40300	0	a	Yeah the in she is the interface .
40301	0	a	And that that is a problem , you are right , because because we do not have a one person we d we do not have enough one person rooms for accommodating the the admin place .
40302	0	a	So
40303	0	a	Yep .
40304	0	a	And if you put two person persons or three persons for the admin space , who who who else would you put in there ?
40305	0	a	Because we do not have any assistant manager or we do not have
40306	0	a	We have only one half part half time admin and no other non researcher positions , if I am not mistaken .
40307	0	a	And this is really a piece of a problem .
40308	0	a	Yep .
40309	1	a	Maybe you could put some visitors , but I know .
40310	0	a	Yeah .
40311	0	a	Yeah , I think
40312	0	a	Yeah .
40313	1	a	It is not very realistic in a in a in an admin room , but
40314	0	a	Yeah , because You ca not put a researcher there .
40315	0	a	I think putting Gisella with the other admin of the school is not an option , because we were not offered
40316	0	a	Yeah , it would be nice ,
40317	0	a	but
40318	1	a	Okay , I will try to find out ,
40319	0	a	but I th
40320	0	a	Yeah .
40321	0	a	I think that is a excellent idea .
40322	1	a	Why do not we ask about that ?
40323	0	a	I mean there is certainly enough space down the hall , wi if all of those offices that are , where half of them are also half time , and they are very under used .
40324	0	a	That is just
40325	0	a	Either you lose one position or you find another admin or assistant manager .
40326	0	a	Yeah .
40327	0	a	So And Pierrette too .
40328	0	a	Okay , we will try , but all these , yeah , are say sort of difficult questions because they involve changing also the offices of the school and , you know , people just do not want to change in general .
40329	0	a	Yep .
40330	1	a	, let is see , maybe we can find some temporary well , at least a proposal for Gisella .
40331	0	a	So , since the one person rooms are quite , well , sort of desired by a lot of people , she should probably
40332	0	a	No , y
40333	0	a	Yeah .
40334	0	a	No that is not sure that is not sure .
40335	0	a	the there are To me there are two options possible
40336	1	a	is either you we can take one of the one person rooms for the admin ,
40337	0	a	because some of , typically , the professors have good reasons for sharing .
40338	0	a	Okay .
40339	0	a	Sharing either with a colleague or sharing with some of their one of their PHD students .
40340	0	a	In that case it is it is realistic .
40341	0	a	Then we could very very simply allocate the one pers one of the one person rooms for the admin .
40342	0	a	And that would solve the problem .
40343	1	a	The other thing is to take a two person room for the admin .
40344	1	a	That could be the one close to the close to the here in the centre so the
40345	0	a	Yeah .
40346	0	a	, the the middle one here ?
40347	0	a	Okay .
40348	0	a	But tha No no no , the other one , the the one op
40349	0	a	Yeah , here , this one .
40350	0	a	This one .
40351	0	a	Okay .
40352	0	a	But then that the the question of what do we do with the second position there remains fully open .
40353	1	a	So I would be I would be more of the opinion to to see whether it is it is so evident that , let is say the at least the two full full time professors that are here on the list , we have one here , but Maggie is is not present .
40354	0	a	Well
40355	0	a	Yeah .
40356	1	a	If they really Yeah , and Pierrette .
40357	0	a	Yeah .
40358	1	a	If if if because of personal preferences they would be happy with a two person room , which might or might not be the case .
40359	0	a	Yeah , well .
40360	0	a	I mean it is it is certainly not something that we should impose ,
40361	1	a	but we can ask .
40362	0	a	Yeah .
40363	1	a	Yeah , because in this case , yeah , Gisella could take one of the the two person rooms and the other place would be for some kind of visitor ,
40364	0	a	that I or
40365	0	a	Yeah , but that is not realistic either .
40366	0	a	I mean , you have you have a fore foreign researcher coming visiting you and you will put put him in the admin office ?
40367	0	a	you will not do that .
40368	0	a	Okay .
40369	1	a	I mean , maybe you can do that with an exchange student , that is
40370	0	a	But you ca not take a senior visitor and him in the in the secretary .
40371	0	a	Yeah ,
40372	1	a	with with younger people ,
40373	0	a	yeah .
40374	0	a	Yeah ,
40375	1	a	or an intern .
40376	0	a	No .
40377	0	a	So we we invite invite and
40378	0	a	then we say , okay you can sit with Gisella .
40379	0	a	you are here .
40380	0	a	Yeah .
40381	0	a	Okay .
40382	0	a	Okay so this sets a bit the stage for for Gisella then .
40383	0	a	yeah we will try to to find out .
40384	0	a	, actually , yeah , maybe we should remind that quite a lot of professors at the at the school actually share their office with their assistant .
40385	0	a	So b it looks like sort of an implicit tradition .
40386	0	a	Except for in every other faculty .
40387	1	a	Maybe not to be followed .
40388	0	a	As Susan said , p
40389	0	a	Yeah ?
40390	0	a	Is that so ?
40391	0	a	Oh .
40392	0	a	Okay .
40393	0	a	Yes , it is so .
40394	0	a	Every other faculty as far as I have seen their offices and the people that I know and that is in in law , socio economics , okay ?
40395	0	a	It is a They all have their own office .
40396	0	a	Yeah .
40397	0	a	Okay .
40398	0	a	I mean in in the in the law faculty they are at best there half time .
40399	0	a	No no , that is it .
40400	0	a	As we said , it is it is really a matter of personal preference , it cannot be something else .
40401	0	a	It cannot be imposed for sure .
40402	0	a	Yeah .
40403	0	a	It is job .
40404	0	a	, okay so I think Well , this sets a bit the stage .
40405	0	a	could we try
40406	0	a	So could you try please to
40407	0	a	Do you want an extra piece of paper ?
40408	1	a	Maybe try to , well , think on your own and then talk a little bit just to the people around you .
40409	0	a	Again , Andre , I think that the only realistic way we can do is to speak for our for ourselves .
40410	0	a	I can tell you according to what I know now where I would like or would be ready to be , but I really do not see how I could decide for Maggie or Pierrette or whoever else on the list , that they should be there .
40411	0	a	Yeah .
40412	0	a	No the point was to try to , well , just talk to them , to David , or
40413	0	a	We are going to have to .
40414	1	a	Yeah , b why why could not we do like could not we do it like for for the the set up of meetings .
40415	0	a	You you
40416	0	a	everyone received that and should provide
40417	0	a	Yeah , I would like to be here .
40418	0	a	And then you will have this multi constraint problem and you work during two hours and you come up with the optimal solution .
40419	0	a	Yeah .
40420	0	a	So w w w
40421	0	a	will you ask people just for their place or also for the other people is place ?
40422	0	a	Because
40423	0	a	Uh huh .
40424	0	a	Yeah , I would I would ask for their place .
40425	0	a	I mean that is that is that is the important thing you want to know .
40426	0	a	Well , but that is
40427	0	a	W what abou what about the the the cafeteria ?
40428	0	a	I mean , we are going to purchase a cafeteria with a projector and all this altogether or
40429	0	a	Reading room , yeah .
40430	0	a	it is a reading room .
40431	0	a	It is altogether .
40432	0	a	Reading room , it is not a cafeteria .
40433	0	a	So in the living room
40434	0	a	Bu I ju just before finishing
40435	0	a	, I mean , we have a cafeteria or we do not eat at all ?
40436	0	a	A place n what we can take a coffee also .
40437	0	a	But that that is an open question whether it is a
40438	0	a	it is a
40439	0	a	it is a it
40440	0	a	At the origin it was supposed to be a f pure reading room for relaxing , reading the newspapers , et cetera , et cetera .
40441	0	a	there has been a very long discussion about that .
40442	0	a	I stinct this discussion is still vivid , that some of the people , I bel belong to these people , would like to have a mixed room where you can have a reading room for sure , but also meeting room if necessary .
40443	0	a	Or , as Susan said , a room an emergency room where you can put some visitors in a decent environment for for for for work , because you do not have any other place to do it .
40444	0	a	But that is that is really an open discussion and that d I think no decision , no final decision has been taken about that .
40445	0	a	Yeah .
40446	0	a	Okay , th then
40447	1	a	Okay then for the next time , try to come up either with your own preferences ,
40448	0	a	that is quite easy probably to state now that you know the constraints ,
40449	1	a	or if you can poll a little bit the people around you ,
40450	0	a	that would be I mean , even
40451	0	a	Well , just discuss i
40452	0	a	Yeah ,
40453	0	a	for instance , I mean
40454	0	a	No , no ,
40455	1	a	I was thinking just ask people around you what they think about this .
40456	0	a	Yes .
40457	0	a	Yes .
40458	1	a	The one that I do not want to have in the next room ?
40459	0	a	Okay .
40460	1	a	And I think , yeah , it will be nice to to come with maybe a sketch of of these .
40461	1	a	If you can do slides , it is even better , but do not be that formal .
40462	0	a	And we will try to at least build up one coherent proposal , and we will merge it with the other one when the other one is available .
40463	0	a	Okay .
40464	0	a	Okay ,
40465	1	a	I will ask Maggie and Pierrette if they have any preferences .
40466	0	a	That would be great .
40467	0	a	Oh , great .
40468	0	a	That would be great .
40469	0	a	Perfect .
40470	0	a	C that that of course is one of the main well not main but one of the important features that we need to know about .
40471	0	a	Yeah .
40472	0	a	Yeah .
40473	0	a	No .
40474	0	a	Yeah , since they are not at the meeting I think it is in out of courtesy we should first ask them .
40475	0	a	Yes .
40476	0	a	And I will try to
40477	0	a	Fine .
40478	0	a	Yes .
40479	0	a	We do not have cafeteria .
40480	0	a	What do you mean by cafeteria exactly ?
40481	0	a	What
40482	0	a	Yeah , w we can bring your coffee in the reading room ,
40483	0	a	but
40484	0	a	So so since maybe , you are a part time here , and part ti part time at EPFL , there are at least two coffee machines in the building , one at the third floor , one at the first floor .
40485	0	a	He means reading room .
40486	0	a	No , there is no coffee in the reading room .
40487	0	a	No ?
40488	0	a	But they close at five or ?
40489	0	a	okay .
40490	0	a	That was the wrong
40491	0	a	We we did not have any money for buying the coffee machines , so Five .
40492	0	a	And we can bring our coffee .
40493	0	a	No automatic coffee machines .
40494	0	a	No .
40495	0	a	Coffee machines .
40496	0	a	Okay , okay .
40497	0	a	So yeah .
40498	0	a	No , there is the cafeteria is downstairs , but they close at five .
40499	0	a	But , in
40500	0	a	Uh huh .
40501	0	a	Yeah , yeah , this .
40502	0	a	that is the main problem .
40503	0	a	Yeah ,
40504	0	a	but there is the two machines , and they are the vending machines where you just put the money
40505	0	a	and and you can get
40506	0	a	Yeah .
40507	0	a	Yeah , vending machines .
40508	0	a	And you can bring your coffee in the reading room .
40509	0	a	Okay .
40510	0	a	Okay .
40511	0	a	Yeah .
40512	0	a	Yeah , maybe this is not a very bad timing .
40513	1	a	Could we try to meet next Tuesday ? , next Tuesday maybe at t maybe a bit later ?
40514	1	a	Maybe at eleven o'clock ?
40515	1	a	Come on , try try to be nice .

40527	0	a	Next Tuesday we have a meeting , yeah .

40529	0	a	Yeah , for me it is a good timing .
40530	0	a	Uh huh , okay .
40531	0	a	Yeah .
40532	0	a	Exactly .
40533	0	a	That might be

40536	0	a	Okay , so , yeah

40539	0	a	yeah .
40540	0	a	Yeah .
40541	0	a	At nine thirty ,
40542	1	a	but we could do we could have this meeting then in the afternoon .
40543	0	a	That that would be great ,
40544	0	a	because that would allow us not to move , or not to travel twice .
40545	0	a	Okay .
40546	0	a	Nah ?
40547	0	a	Yep .
40548	0	a	Very well .

40562	0	a	Okay .
40563	0	a	Or you get it .
40564	0	a	Okay .
40565	0	a	No I do not think so
40566	1	a	it has to be like that
40567	0	a	yeah
40568	1	a	and you have to adjust the length .
40569	0	a	Okay , and then .
40570	0	a	So

40622	0	a	So .
40623	0	a	Yes .
40624	0	a	So
40625	1	a	w we will try to structure this meeting with an a with an agenda as presented here .
40626	0	a	after the opening we will tr get acquainted to each other .
40627	0	a	See what our roles are in this project .
40628	0	a	So ,
40629	0	a	We have been provided with some w technical tools to to communicate and to well , learn from each other is plans
40630	1	a	as I can say
40631	0	a	so
40632	0	a	w we will also try to to get acquainted to this tools
40633	0	a	so
40634	0	a	they are also new to me
40635	0	a	I do not know whether you worked with them before .
40636	0	a	then we will come to the to the to the actual project plan .
40637	0	a	You all know I hope how it is about the new r remote control we are going going to design .
40638	0	a	Total .
40639	0	a	then we will discuss
40640	1	a	, well , how it should be and wh what what our new product should look lite like .
40641	0	a	And well then after some twenty five minutes I hope we can end this meeting .
40642	0	a	So .
40643	0	a	basically this is about a a new c remote control .
40644	0	a	We
40645	0	a	When you design a new product you of you of course want it to be original .
40646	0	a	Be
40647	0	a	we want to be distinguished ,
40648	0	a	People want to when they look at the shelf want to think , well that is the product
40649	0	a	I I need .
40650	1	a	So it needs to be trendy .
40651	0	a	I mean trendy is what people want , so
40652	0	a	then I w they will buy our product .
40653	1	a	But then , , it also should work user friendly
40654	0	a	and otherwise people well it will not be be rated very well in consumer articles and like that .
40655	0	a	So ,
40656	0	a	the general outline of new project will be we first go through a functional design phase .
40657	0	a	You all get certain task in this in this phase and then we will meet again and discuss this functional design .
40658	0	a	And the same holds for the ph two phases after this , the conceptual design and after that a a more detailed design in which the the final project should get its definite shape .
40659	0	a	Alright ,
40660	1	a	but first we will do some tool training .
40661	0	a	In all in front of you you see the notebooks and w n note blocks and we have here a a a a white board .
40662	0	a	Whitebo
40663	0	a	Yeah ,
40664	1	a	you can start it you know .
40665	0	a	And well it should work
40666	0	a	I have read it from my from some colleague that it should work with some kind of toolbar .
40667	0	a	I did not find out yet how it work ,
40668	0	a	but maybe one of you did , so
40669	0	a	Yes .
40670	0	a	Under documents in the shared folder .
40671	0	a	Okay .
40672	0	a	Do Do we have to say something about that ?
40673	0	a	I I
40674	0	a	I am not fully updated about this shared folder .
40675	0	a	Yeah ,
40676	0	a	I guess we will have a shared folder with documents that we can share .
40677	0	a	And , yeah .
40678	0	a	Yes well
40679	1	a	we will then find out ho how it works .
40680	0	a	Yes .
40681	0	a	Well ,
40682	0	a	this seems to me , yes , some computer program
40683	0	a	but I did not find it yet .
40684	0	a	So ,
40685	1	a	we will come to that later .
40686	0	a	So ,
40687	1	a	now we will try out the white board we have here .
40688	0	a	So ,
40689	1	a	I would suggest
40690	0	a	Well ,
40691	0	a	yes ,
40692	1	a	we we should try to t to draw on it
40693	0	a	and then well it should be smart some way .
40694	1	a	Each of us is going .
40695	0	a	I
40696	0	a	I am not really sure how this works , but
40697	0	a	Yes , a good idea Mael .
40698	0	a	Okay ,
40699	1	a	shall I start ?
40700	0	a	So ,
40701	0	a	i But it is
40702	0	a	Actually , I think I cannot go with
40703	0	a	Yeah .
40704	0	a	Yeah .
40705	0	a	I think for us it is just like a normal whiteboard , but they will be recording what we write down .
40706	0	a	No
40707	0	a	they will record through that .
40708	0	a	There is a sensor over there which is going to record the strokes that you make .
40709	0	a	But for us it is just like a normal whiteboard .
40710	0	a	Okay .
40711	0	a	Yeah .
40712	0	a	Kay .
40713	0	a	You you
40714	0	a	D does not it work ?
40715	0	a	Maybe someo
40716	1	a	Maybe maybe Anna , maybe you can start .
40717	0	a	Then he can maybe find out to get his cord right .
40718	0	a	I have to draw .
40719	0	a	So

40856	0	a	Thank you , Matthew .
40857	0	a	It is a very big rat .
40858	0	a	Perfect .
40859	0	a	Or a very small cat .
40860	0	a	Oh
40861	0	a	a rat , okay .
40862	0	a	Yes , this is certain some contribution to our project .
40863	0	a	And you ,
40864	1	a	A bird .
40865	0	a	kay .
40866	1	a	Your turn .
40867	0	a	So .
40868	0	a	Let is see .
40869	0	a	Which animal has not been drawn yet .
40870	0	a	So
40871	0	a	you have all drawn land animals ,
40872	1	a	so why not draw an animal from the water .
40873	0	a	Okay , in the water .
40874	0	a	I do not know what that is .
40875	0	a	It is a bit
40876	0	a	It is a bit hard to guess .
40877	0	a	Yeah .
40878	0	a	So
40879	0	a	The cat is going to eat the fish or the rat ?
40880	0	a	it is a baby shark , it looks to me ,
40881	0	a	you know it is going to eat the cat rather than the cat eating the fish , no ?
40882	1	a	You should go for the next one it seems to me .
40883	1	a	Put it colours .
40884	0	a	Maybe it would help us .
40885	0	a	Yeah .
40886	0	a	Yes .
40887	1	a	With different pen widths .
40888	0	a	Oh ,
40889	0	a	it is a shark now .
40890	0	a	So
40891	0	a	Oh ,
40892	0	a	yes , why not ?
40893	0	a	Good idea .
40894	0	a	it is a shark ,
40895	0	a	yeah .
40896	0	a	Oh .
40897	0	a	Now it is a swordfish .
40898	0	a	Why not .
40899	0	a	You have some in in Australia ,
40900	0	a	right ?
40901	0	a	Yeah .
40902	0	a	A swordfish .
40903	0	a	Swordfish .
40904	0	a	, maybe .
40905	0	a	I dunno .
40906	0	a	I have never seen one , no .
40907	0	a	Oh well .
40908	0	a	Yeah .
40909	0	a	I hope it still works .
40910	0	a	Perfect .
40911	0	a	So W Well ,
40912	0	a	this this tool seemed to work .
40913	0	a	So
40914	0	a	I dunno if we need to spend time on that , actually
40915	0	a	But
40916	0	a	Yeah , exactly
40917	0	a	, yeah .
40918	1	a	Let is continue to to the real stuff .
40919	0	a	Wow .
40920	0	a	our project finance thing .
40921	0	a	when we are and when w you are going to design w
40922	0	a	we must keep in mind that the selling price of the product will be about twenty five Euros ,
40923	1	a	so when designing a project I also look at you Mael , keep in mind People want to get the feeling this is a twenty five Euro project pr product .
40924	0	a	Twenty four .
40925	0	a	Yeah .
40926	0	a	Per remote control ,
40927	0	a	yeah ?
40928	0	a	Per project .
40929	0	a	Yes .
40930	0	a	Okay .
40931	0	a	more interesting for our company of course , p profit aim , about fifty million Euro .
40932	0	a	So
40933	1	a	we have to sell quite a lot of this things .
40934	0	a	we will try to to get at a international market
40935	0	a	so
40936	0	a	it will be I think mainly
40937	0	a	Europe and Northern America , maybe some Asian countries .
40938	0	a	yeah ,
40939	0	a	the sale man , four million .
40940	0	a	also important for you all is the the product production cost must be maximal twelve twelve Euro and fifty cents .
40941	0	a	So it is half of the selling price , if I am good in mathematics .
40942	0	a	Yes , of course .
40943	0	a	I mean
40944	0	a	we still have to to make a profit ,
40945	0	a	huh ?
40946	0	a	You all have to be paid .
40947	0	a	Of course .
40948	0	a	They have to sell at least four million to make a profit
40949	0	a	we have to make
40950	0	a	we have to sell at least four million to make our own profit .
40951	0	a	Excuse me ?
40952	0	a	Yes , indeed .
40953	0	a	Oh
40954	0	a	you are g very good in mathematics .
40955	0	a	Fifty mill
40956	1	a	Of course it should have a on off button .
40957	0	a	Yes .
40958	0	a	Four million .
40959	0	a	So well
40960	0	a	I think w when we are working on the international market , in principle it has enough customers
40961	0	a	so
40962	0	a	when we have a good product we we could meet this this aim , I think .
40963	0	a	Yeah .
40964	0	a	So ,
40965	0	a	that about finance .
40966	1	a	And now just let have some discussion about what is a good remote control
40967	0	a	and well keep in mind this this first point , it has to be original , it has to be trendy , it has to be user friendly .
40968	1	a	, maybe someone can mention some additional prerequisites for a good remote control .
40969	0	a	Yes , well
40970	1	a	i it should have the the the the expected functionality of a remote control .
40971	0	a	Yeah .
40972	0	a	Yeah ,
40973	0	a	s
40974	0	a	and it depends what application you are using it for .
40975	0	a	You might need
40976	0	a	We are targ targeting the television set .
40977	0	a	We wer we were thinking television .
40978	0	a	So ,
40979	1	a	you need to record the channels .
40980	0	a	Yeah .
40981	1	a	You need to browse the browse the channels in upward downward way ,
40982	0	a	And , and
40983	0	a	Marketing .
40984	0	a	Yes , yes .
40985	0	a	Th th that is very handy
40986	0	a	I I always miss it and on some remote controls that you can go channel up or down ins instead of retyping the number , especially when you have a lot of channels .
40987	0	a	And just before starting the detailed discussion , maybe we
40988	0	a	are the marketing guy ?
40989	0	a	Or
40990	0	a	th
40991	0	a	So you are the marketing .
40992	0	a	I am marketing .
40993	0	a	Yep .
40994	0	a	And you are in the u use user interface design .
40995	0	a	Yeah .
40996	0	a	Yes .
40997	0	a	So just yeah
40998	0	a	I wanted to to be sure .
40999	0	a	Yeah .
41000	0	a	Sure .
41001	0	a	And I I am the the industrial designer
41002	0	a	okay .
41003	0	a	Yes .
41004	0	a	Because I I do not know you very well , actually ,
41005	0	a	but yeah .
41006	0	a	Oh .
41007	0	a	I am Matthew .
41008	0	a	Okay .
41009	0	a	You know .
41010	0	a	Mael .
41011	0	a	Matth s
41012	0	a	Anna .
41013	0	a	Happy to meet you .
41014	0	a	Anna .
41015	0	a	Okay .
41016	0	a	It is very
41017	0	a	so
41018	0	a	yeah
41019	0	a	Just on your web page
41020	0	a	but yeah not not face to face .
41021	0	a	And
41022	0	a	Matthew , yeah .
41023	0	a	A
41024	0	a	and I am Nanne .
41025	0	a	I thi think you know me ,
41026	0	a	yeah ?
41027	0	a	right
41028	0	a	yeah .
41029	0	a	So
41030	0	a	Yes .
41031	0	a	So .
41032	0	a	S S s
41033	0	a	Are there some other very important things to to do well , to specify in this first phase of of the project .
41034	0	a	So .
41035	0	a	So So
41036	0	a	I
41037	0	a	Like what ?
41038	0	a	Like internet on the on TV ?
41039	0	a	Yeah .
41040	0	a	So
41041	1	a	And , you would need the usual ones , like the changing the volume , changing the the channel
41042	0	a	and then you
41043	0	a	Today we have teletext and all those things .
41044	0	a	So
41045	0	a	the browse function , as you m mentioned .
41046	0	a	Yeah .
41047	0	a	Oth yeah .
41048	0	a	Yes .
41049	0	a	Yeah .
41050	0	a	Tomorrow you might have a some more functions which might come through that , so Yeah IPO or .
41051	0	a	Yes .
41052	0	a	Now we are looking for television things or IP .
41053	0	a	For example personal video recorder and all those stuffs are coming up .
41054	0	a	But we ca not really design for something that has not been invented yet .
41055	0	a	Yeah .
41056	0	a	it is it is it is it is coming up , actually .
41057	0	a	The personal video recorder and all those things it is coming up .
41058	0	a	, well
41059	0	a	I I think
41060	1	a	w y you two should should , I think , think this over w espec
41061	1	a	what , what functionality .
41062	0	a	Actually , yeah
41063	0	a	w
41064	0	a	Of course ,
41065	0	a	and first before designing the func
41066	0	a	well
41067	1	a	thinking about the functionalities , we need to know what are the user requirements .
41068	0	a	Let is Let is take
41069	0	a	Oh
41070	1	a	in that case you can you always hook up with someone who is providing that
41071	1	a	and you know , you you sell their product as well as your product with them , you know .
41072	0	a	Yeah .
41073	0	a	then if they need internet , then we would be able to to p to propose something with TV over IP .
41074	0	a	Yeah .
41075	0	a	Yeah .
41076	0	a	Yeah ,
41077	0	a	but w w we want to design a new one .
41078	0	a	But Ninety percent of the time , ninety nine percent of the time , people will be using the main functions , the volume , the different channels ,
41079	0	a	so
41080	1	a	we can have all the fancy things as well but the main controls need to be very obvious and very easy to use .
41081	0	a	Keep k keep in mind i it is a it is a twenty five Euro unit ,
41082	1	a	so the the very fancy stuff w we can leave that out , I think .
41083	0	a	So
41084	0	a	twenty five Euro you expect a quite , well normal but good functioning user friendly remote control .
41085	1	a	So try and get TV manufacturers to
41086	0	a	Yeah .
41087	0	a	No ,
41088	0	a	it is okay ,
41089	0	a	yeah
41090	0	a	I understand .
41091	1	a	So we need some numbering buttons , some teletext things
41092	0	a	and then
41093	0	a	Yeah .
41094	0	a	Yeah .
41095	0	a	The
41096	0	a	Yeah ,
41097	0	a	the main is browsing .
41098	0	a	Yes ,
41099	1	a	but but but ab about the spec the buttons , the buttons that will be on it .
41100	0	a	Yeah .
41101	1	a	I I think we can discuss that in the in the next meeting .
41102	0	a	Yeah .
41103	1	a	I would like to get this wrapped up and go to an end of this meeting .
41104	0	a	Okay .
41105	0	a	So So
41106	0	a	you know now the basic the basic things .
41107	0	a	Okay ,
41108	0	a	we are alread .
41109	0	a	Okay .
41110	0	a	Yeah .
41111	0	a	well
41112	1	a	just just for the next meeting , well , , you wor yes , work on a design , keep it general ,
41113	0	a	I mean so w we will be still fle flexible with maybe adding some functions .
41114	0	a	L
41115	0	a	Yeah , sure .
41116	0	a	So
41117	0	a	you will be working on on technical function design , so
41118	1	a	And you and you and well , think about requirements ,
41119	0	a	eh ?
41120	0	a	Does it need internet , or or do do we stay at basic basic television interface .
41121	0	a	Stam .
41122	0	a	Yeah .
41123	0	a	So ,
41124	1	a	I think we should now all go work at this
41125	0	a	and you will be informed via email and other kind of communication .
41126	0	a	So
41127	0	a	next meeting will be in in thirty minutes .
41128	0	a	 
41129	0	a	Okay .
41130	0	a	So
41131	0	a	I see all everybody is here ,
41132	0	a	kay .
41133	0	a	Yep .
41134	1	a	And we can start meeting .
41135	0	a	Okay .
41136	0	a	What is the agenda for this meeting ?
41137	0	a	Okay .
41138	0	a	The
41139	1	a	I will present here agenda with with with with slides to you .
41140	0	a	as you can see here .
41141	0	a	Perfect .
41142	0	a	So
41143	0	a	first just to mention I will take notes of this meeting
41144	1	a	and I will try to work them out and give them to you .
41145	0	a	I have also made notes of the previous meeting and I was about to send them you
41146	0	a	but then I had to go to this meeting
41147	1	a	so you will get them too
41148	0	a	Next .
41149	0	a	So y you are the secretary also .
41150	0	a	Yes .
41151	0	a	Right ?
41152	0	a	Okay .
41153	0	a	Indeed .
41154	0	a	Then I hope you all have worked out some some some some presentations about about well you the the task given to you in the previous meeting .
41155	0	a	Perfectly yeah
41156	0	a	yeah
41157	0	a	of course uh huh .
41158	1	a	W We will in a minute we will start with them .
41159	1	a	, we will see in which order we will handle them of .
41160	0	a	then I will bring in some some some new requirements I I got from the account manager ,
41161	1	a	I try to work them out ,
41162	0	a	they were quite abstract ,
41163	0	a	and we can have maybe have com some discussion about it .
41164	0	a	about the functions
41165	0	a	and
41166	0	a	Well
41167	0	a	in this meeting we should really try to reach a decision about the target group and the functionality of
41168	0	a	the Yes
41169	0	a	I mean well yes w who are we going to to well to sell this ,
41170	0	a	the customers , indeed yes .
41171	0	a	You mean the social target group who we wants to target ?
41172	0	a	Oh the customers , okay .
41173	0	a	Yeah .
41174	0	a	Think that is that is important matter .
41175	0	a	That is the big question
41176	0	a	yeah .
41177	0	a	So
41178	0	a	And then we will close this meeting and after this meeting we will we will have a lunch .
41179	0	a	Good .
41180	0	a	Maybe
41181	0	a	why
41182	0	a	Anna can you c do you have a presentations ?
41183	0	a	You do not have presentation ?
41184	0	a	you want a table to to
41185	0	a	Yes yes maybe maybe you can can just talk about it
41186	1	a	or maybe you can use the whiteboard if necessary .
41187	0	a	No , I do not .
41188	0	a	I was not .
41189	0	a	No .
41190	1	a	I c
41191	1	a	I can talk about it
41192	0	a	but I have no slides or anything .
41193	0	a	Well
41194	0	a	I have just been presented with some research we have done in a small focus group
41195	0	a	so ,
41196	0	a	a hundred people , just asked them about their remote control usage habits and what they want in a remote control .
41197	0	a	It is
41198	0	a	probably ca not email this to you , I have just got a web page with some data on it .
41199	0	a	basically it is saying that users generally dislike the look and feel of their remote controls .
41200	0	a	seventy five u seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly .
41201	0	a	Eighty percent of users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy .
41202	0	a	Current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour of the user .
41203	0	a	seventy five percent of users said they zap a lot , so they use their remote control quite frequently while they are watching television .
41204	0	a	Fifty percent of users say that they only use ten percent of the buttons , so they have got a remote control with a lot of functionality but really most of the time they only use a small part of that .
41205	0	a	Do you Do you have this information on the web page you said ?
41206	0	a	Yes ,
41207	1	a	mayb maybe you can can send an email to me later .
41208	0	a	I have an a web page yes .
41209	0	a	Yep .
41210	0	a	Yep , sure .
41211	1	a	about this .
41212	0	a	So basically
41213	0	a	there is a breakdown of how much they use the different functions on a rem remote control .
41214	0	a	, power and volume selection are only used a few times within this per hour .
41215	0	a	, channel selection is used a hundred and sixty eight times and then there is things like channel settings , audio settings , which are only used very infrequently .
41216	0	a	Teletext is used fourteen times in the hour , so it is used but not nearly as much as the channel selection is used .
41217	0	a	An interesting thing that this report has brought up
41218	0	a	is that fifty fifty percent of users report that the remote control gets lost a lot of the time in the room ,
41219	0	a	so some way of some way of locating the remote control would be very useful to a lot of users .
41220	0	a	Yes yes ,
41221	0	a	I have that too .
41222	0	a	Thirty four percent said it takes too long to learn to use a remote control , they want something that is easier to use straight away , more intuitive perhaps .
41223	0	a	It is it is easy to learn or how do you say it is
41224	0	a	Okay too much time to learn .
41225	0	a	Thirty four percent said it took too much time to learn to use a new one .
41226	0	a	Yep .
41227	0	a	Okay .
41228	0	a	Not enough
41229	0	a	Maybe y y you cannot put this webpage online on the
41230	0	a	it is it
41231	0	a	okay
41232	0	a	it is a webpage on the C it is a file
41233	0	a	okay .
41234	0	a	And thirty twenty six percent said remote controls are bad for RSI .
41235	1	a	I do not know how we would go about combating that .
41236	0	a	What do you mean there ?
41237	0	a	Okay .
41238	0	a	For RSI ?
41239	0	a	Respet Repetitive strain injury .
41240	0	a	So .
41241	0	a	But
41242	0	a	They think that or do their doctor the doctor says ?
41243	0	a	But it is it is the opinion of the of the users huh ?
41244	0	a	So .
41245	0	a	Yeah .
41246	0	a	That is what the report says yeah .
41247	0	a	and then it is got a demographic breakdown
41248	0	a	on
41249	0	a	I should be able to actually , if I email it to you now .
41250	1	a	You can disconnect it there
41251	0	a	no ?
41252	1	a	Then you can connect this one or this one
41253	0	a	yeah .
41254	0	a	You can maybe just just
41255	0	a	Oh no , yeah .
41256	0	a	Yeah .
41257	1	a	O otherwise you
41258	1	a	yeah .
41259	1	a	, s hang on .
41260	1	a	You can connect this one .
41261	0	a	All to your computer .
41262	0	a	Yeah .
41263	0	a	Well .
41264	0	a	So
41265	0	a	these are important numbers
41266	1	a	that Matthew and I need to take into account for our functional
41267	0	a	Yeah
41268	0	a	Yeah
41269	1	a	these numbers have have to be have to be taken into account for the both
41270	1	a	yeah
41271	1	a	user interface and functional design .
41272	0	a	Oh yeah .
41273	0	a	Oh
41274	0	a	I need to muck around with this .
41275	1	a	It is probably easier if you put it on yours
41276	1	a	and then I will just email it to you .
41277	0	a	It is just a web link .
41278	0	a	Okay .
41279	0	a	Yeah .
41280	0	a	One thing it goes on to talk about , which is interesting ,
41281	0	a	is the
41282	1	a	hang on a minute .
41283	0	a	Because if there are many numbers
41284	1	a	and we need to select to to constraint our design based on what is more important .
41285	0	a	Yep .
41286	0	a	, one thing is interesting is talking about speech recognition in a remote control .
41287	0	a	Speech recognition in okay .
41288	0	a	And who would pay more for that and whether people would find it useful .
41289	0	a	D do you have numbers o o on that ?
41290	0	a	Well
41291	1	a	it would it would be a solution for when your remote control is lost ,
41292	0	a	I mean when it has speech recognition then i then it does not matter where it is ,
41293	0	a	my well it is we should be in range ,
41294	1	a	or maybe it can respond and produce sound , so say where it is .
41295	0	a	Yes ,
41296	1	a	I will just get this up .
41297	0	a	So that we do not
41298	0	a	Do we not need any button on the remote control it would be all based on speech .
41299	0	a	Well
41300	0	a	potentially yeah ,
41301	0	a	I think even for interesti
41302	0	a	yeah
41303	0	a	I think that would not work so well .
41304	0	a	Okay .
41305	0	a	Interesting idea .
41306	1	a	You want to have both options .
41307	0	a	Okay .
41308	0	a	Yeah .
41309	0	a	Yeah .
41310	0	a	But the these are all quite fancy features I am not sure whether we will we can make this for for twelve Euro fi and fifty cents .
41311	0	a	Well
41312	0	a	it would be f
41313	0	a	No you ca not .
41314	0	a	Yeah .
41315	0	a	Yeah .
41316	0	a	And we do not know where the state of the art of speech recognition is ,
41317	0	a	maybe you know ?
41318	0	a	But it is quite noisy if there is the TV shouting .
41319	0	a	Oh .
41320	0	a	Well ,
41321	0	a	it depends
41322	0	a	you know like
41323	0	a	there is it is a very small vocabulary that you want to do the operations like you want to say on , off , one , two , twenty three ,
41324	0	a	yeah .
41325	0	a	Yeah .
41326	0	a	It is it is going to be li
41327	0	a	it is not going to be s so easy
41328	0	a	but u usually it is going to be more of an isolated case
41329	0	a	but it is
41330	0	a	but I do not know with twenty fi
41331	0	a	Okay
41332	0	a	it is decline .
41333	0	a	Yes ,
41334	0	a	that that that that is .
41335	0	a	Do you have some more important facts
41336	0	a	or can we go to the next presentation ?
41337	0	a	Okay .
41338	0	a	Well
41339	0	a	This is now talking about who would pay for speech recognition in a remote control , who would pay more for it , .
41340	0	a	So
41341	1	a	you had to to to summarise maybe the
41342	0	a	Ninety percent of the fifteen to twenty five year old market said that they would pay more , it goes down from there , seventy six percent for twenty five to thirty five , thirty five percent for thirty five to forty five , twenty two percent for forty five to fifty five and then eight percent for fifty five to sixty five .
41343	0	a	Okay .
41344	0	a	Yeah .
41345	0	a	But we sh
41346	0	a	Yeah ,
41347	0	a	it really depends where we are going to be targeting this product , , which we will be talking about later I think .
41348	0	a	Decline with age , .
41349	0	a	Yes .
41350	0	a	We will talk about it later .
41351	0	a	Did you get the email ?
41352	0	a	Yep , that one .
41353	0	a	Okay .
41354	1	a	Just follow that link .
41355	0	a	I thi You us
41356	0	a	yeah yeah .
41357	0	a	It will be in a different window , yep .
41358	0	a	That is
41359	1	a	left
41360	0	a	that one .
41361	0	a	Yep .
41362	0	a	Okay perfect .
41363	0	a	So
41364	0	a	that is the figure that I was just talking about there , with the different demographics .
41365	0	a	Okay .
41366	0	a	Another thing it is talking about there is the LCD screen but there is no figures apparently on that .
41367	0	a	kay .
41368	0	a	Okay .
41369	0	a	maybe Mael c c can you give your presentation ?
41370	0	a	Oh ,
41371	0	a	this is
41372	0	a	, y y you can move , .
41373	0	a	Yeah .
41374	0	a	I okay
41375	1	a	I stay
41376	0	a	I can move as far as
41377	0	a	Maybe I take your chair ?
41378	0	a	I
41379	0	a	okay .
41380	0	a	Now you can move I think
41381	0	a	yeah .
41382	0	a	Yes .
41383	0	a	You can you can sa take my chair .
41384	1	a	It is a channel selection , a module , this and this function , go to the .
41385	0	a	Sorry ?
41386	0	a	Oh .
41387	0	a	Yeah .
41388	0	a	So
41389	0	a	I think as everybody knows I am the Industrial Designer .
41390	1	a	And in this presentation this group presentation is going to focus on the working design of the the remote control .
41391	1	a	I would like first to give a quick a very simple introduction , how does it work ,
41392	0	a	so that everybody knows even if you do not have a very technical background what is it because I think in the product it is important .
41393	0	a	So basically
41394	0	a	the basic function of a remote control is to send messages to another system that is fixed .
41395	0	a	And so
41396	0	a	an energy source feeds an integrated circuit , the chip , that can compose messages , usually through a infrared bit and the user interface controls the chip and accordingly the the messages ,
41397	0	a	alright .
41398	0	a	So
41399	0	a	my method for designing the yeah the work design
41400	0	a	yeah
41401	0	a	first
41402	0	a	the
41403	1	a	the main point is that I would wish to to make a really functional product .
41404	1	a	I would prefer to have very functional capabilities rather than fancy stuff that in fact is not used and does not work .
41405	0	a	So
41406	0	a	for that yeah
41407	1	a	as it is important to take into account the user requirements from the Marketing Expert Anna
41408	0	a	and w to to
41409	1	a	we should agree on what are the technical functions for this remote control
41410	1	a	and I show you the the working design .
41411	0	a	So basically
41412	0	a	here is a really large view of what we want .
41413	0	a	we want an on off button ,
41414	0	a	it can be
41415	0	a	it is simple but it is it is important , and also the to both channels as well as other buttons that come after ,
41416	0	a	right .
41417	0	a	So
41418	0	a	the components I quickly draw here ,
41419	0	a	is that
41420	0	a	in this part you have the remote control the the sender and on the other part the receiver
41421	0	a	so that is my method is will be to
41422	0	a	well
41423	1	a	my aim would be to design the and choose the chips and the infrared components to build the remote control
41424	0	a	right .
41425	0	a	So
41426	0	a	of course we need energy sources and the receiver a a receiver .
41427	0	a	This is very quick design ,
41428	1	a	you stop me or interrupt me if you do not agree on it on that .
41429	0	a	And so
41430	0	a	what I have found and after a lot of work actually
41431	0	a	I
41432	0	a	I draw this
41433	0	a	I draw for you this schema that can be maybe too technical for you
41434	0	a	but is very important for me
41435	0	a	you know .
41436	0	a	Well .
41437	0	a	Uh huh .
41438	0	a	You drew it a long time ago ?
41439	0	a	Ninety one .
41440	0	a	Is huh
41441	0	a	overwhelming .
41442	1	a	And that is it
41443	1	a	so I wo not go into details about that
41444	0	a	but these are my preferences to use that kind of components .
41445	0	a	No .
41446	0	a	And and why do you want these kind of component ?
41447	0	a	I mean , are they cheap , or are they reliable ?
41448	0	a	What were your
41449	0	a	So .
41450	0	a	So
41451	0	a	found and yeah th
41452	0	a	you have always a compromise with reliability
41453	0	a	and
41454	0	a	i if it is expensive ,
41455	0	a	but this one was not
41456	0	a	this one also really reliable
41457	0	a	so yeah
41458	0	a	that is it for the working design ,
41459	0	a	I hope you get clearer view on what what a remote control is in terms of technical components
41460	0	a	but maybe
41461	0	a	yeah
41462	0	a	No no no no
41463	0	a	we we will
41464	0	a	This is a preference but we can always change
41465	0	a	Yeah .
41466	0	a	Yes .
41467	0	a	It it it is more clear now I think .
41468	0	a	So
41469	0	a	But is it
41470	0	a	can you just buy it on the market and f plug it in
41471	0	a	or you want to ma
41472	0	a	Well
41473	0	a	it to du
41474	0	a	it is just you had to change the frequencies .
41475	0	a	What I w what I was thinking about the the the schema about the sender and the receiver ,
41476	0	a	I mean
41477	0	a	can you can you get back to it ?
41478	0	a	Yeah ,
41479	0	a	the receiver is of course already in the television and we are not able to change it .
41480	0	a	Of course yeah .
41481	0	a	So we we must adapt to the to the receiver .
41482	0	a	I I suppose there is a standard way of communicating to televisions .
41483	0	a	Yeah .
41484	0	a	We will use infrared protocol using yeah infrared
41485	0	a	and
41486	0	a	and of course we need to adapt to that protocol that already exists
41487	0	a	and
41488	1	a	but we what we can do is adapting the the chips inside to the best chips and infrared bubbles .
41489	0	a	Yes .
41490	0	a	Okay .
41491	0	a	Okay .
41492	0	a	Thank you .
41493	0	a	The frequencies ?
41494	0	a	Yeah yeah .
41495	0	a	Yeah .
41496	0	a	Of course yeah
41497	0	a	in the chip you have it
41498	0	a	yeah .
41499	1	a	But you should be careful ,
41500	0	a	people are sometime becoming problem , like a guy has recently designed a remote which could switch off any other TVs , so basically through all the things .
41501	0	a	That can control o other things .
41502	0	a	Yeah .
41503	0	a	So maybe we should think of
41504	0	a	yeah .
41505	0	a	Of course yeah
41506	1	a	we should take that into account
41507	0	a	in the
41508	0	a	Yes .
41509	0	a	Yeah yes
41510	0	a	I I
41511	0	a	I
41512	0	a	I
41513	0	a	I feel
41514	0	a	I
41515	0	a	I
41516	1	a	I think M Mael will will consider this th these things .
41517	0	a	That is handy .
41518	0	a	So if the b TV in the next apartment is really loud , you can just turn it off .
41519	0	a	Yeah
41520	0	a	so you can just go on the street and then switch off everyone is TV and you can just walk away
41521	0	a	You do not have to be near the TV at all .
41522	0	a	Yeah .
41523	0	a	I like that idea .
41524	1	a	Maybe Maybe we can go to to your presentation Matthew .
41525	0	a	Yeah
41526	0	a	so .
41527	0	a	I
41528	0	a	I
41529	0	a	I assume you were finished here .
41530	0	a	okay .
41531	0	a	Okay .
41532	0	a	So
41533	1	a	I can take I think mine now there .
41534	0	a	Okay .
41535	0	a	Okay so
41536	0	a	voila .
41537	0	a	I can take mine
41538	0	a	it is okay ,
41539	0	a	voila ,
41540	0	a	so .
41541	0	a	Okay .
41542	0	a	Oh .
41543	0	a	I , sorry ?
41544	0	a	I know where it is .
41545	0	a	It is on the desktop .
41546	0	a	It is
41547	0	a	Yes .
41548	0	a	Technical function .
41549	0	a	Okay .
41550	0	a	It is
41551	0	a	Like so .
41552	0	a	Well .
41553	0	a	So
41554	1	a	I am going to talk a little bit about the technical function
41555	0	a	so wha what actually it is about what is the user going to do , I think my last presented what is going inside , so what is the user is going to see from the outside and how he is going to use it .
41556	0	a	Yep .
41557	0	a	So well
41558	0	a	the approach is that
41559	0	a	basically the idea is to send a message to the TV set , as Mael has pointed , and it will be decoded by the TV and
41560	0	a	usually we it is easier to have keys or buttons with which people can press and then changing a button will basically change the message which is being sent to the TV
41561	0	a	and
41562	0	a	a and basically it sends an internal signal and decoded by the receiver .
41563	0	a	So
41564	0	a	p
41565	0	a	as Anna has said that this ki people are interested in things which are you do not need to k press the keys ,
41566	1	a	people are can have a speech recognition but this is s a question which will we have to see later .
41567	0	a	But in the present scenario is that you have certain keys and you press it like your mobile phone , and it sends a message to the TV .
41568	0	a	Yep .
41569	0	a	And so generally
41570	0	a	I do not have some figures
41571	0	a	sorry
41572	0	a	but so
41573	0	a	there are two kinds of remote if you popularly in the household ,
41574	0	a	actually so
41575	0	a	you have a standard TV remote where you have just a on , off button and play , volume change and keys for the number and more than one digit option .
41576	0	a	And if you see for example righ right now even the one on more than one digit option is for two digit channel which is like ninety nine , but tomorrow you might have one fifty channels you know to browse or two hundred channels to browse who knows ,
41577	0	a	but .
41578	0	a	Then there is
41579	0	a	this is the standard one with without any fancy thing
41580	0	a	you know
41581	0	a	like i it does not have teletext option ,
41582	0	a	it can without any ,
41583	0	a	it is a very simple thing , which which you can vouch .
41584	0	a	And then you have what is the v video remote file
41585	0	a	which is like
41586	0	a	usually it has almost all the keys over there
41587	0	a	and ,
41588	0	a	but it then it has other options like stop
41589	0	a	and then you play the movie or or fo fast forward the movie
41590	0	a	or something like that
41591	0	a	so i
41592	0	a	it has those
41593	0	a	so
41594	0	a	these are the standard commonly found remote controls in the market .
41595	0	a	And then whi
41596	0	a	which is generally used by the people .
41597	0	a	And then
41598	0	a	well
41599	1	a	personal preferences
41600	1	a	I would basically think of having a kind of aim for the next generation thing where the we could have both the the f a TV and the remote video remote control because some of the keys in the video is remote control and the TV they could be integrated together
41601	0	a	so that we could aim for the like in the f coming future that type of applications with
41602	0	a	Yeah .
41603	0	a	Okay .
41604	0	a	How would that work ?
41605	0	a	So
41606	0	a	you have got say maybe a VCR and a TV which are separate ,
41607	0	a	so you
41608	0	a	on my one at home
41609	0	a	I have got a VCR remote which then changes the channel on the VCR and does not do anything on the TV ,
41610	0	a	so is it going to be like a switch on the remote that says t use the TV or use the VCR ?
41611	0	a	or does it know which one you want to use ?
41612	0	a	Yeah .
41613	0	a	actually
41614	0	a	you could you could think of having s a y
41615	1	a	you can have a key which could tell y it could go to the video thing
41616	0	a	but
41617	0	a	yo you you
41618	0	a	you still ca not
41619	1	a	in that case when it you use that the function should be able to take up the VCR option and you could play it or
41620	0	a	You can also think about having
41621	0	a	like
41622	0	a	I in a few days you will be ha
41623	0	a	in in few coming years you might even have a system where you have a separate sitting setup box
41624	0	a	and you have something like you
41625	0	a	do you do you
41626	0	a	suppose you are not able to watch some programme and actually it downloading all the time for you
41627	0	a	and you can just you know
41628	0	a	when you come back you could just switch on that thing and watch a program .
41629	1	a	In that case you want to browse faster , browse slow , you want to have those kind of functionalities .
41630	0	a	These are kind of next generation functionalities .
41631	0	a	It is the next generation thing ,
41632	0	a	but it is going to come in couple of years .
41633	0	a	yes ,
41634	0	a	but I think it is i
41635	0	a	i
41636	0	a	it is already there ,
41637	0	a	I mean the hard disk recorders
41638	0	a	I
41639	0	a	I have seen them in the shop .
41640	0	a	It is goi
41641	0	a	Yeah
41642	0	a	it is
41643	0	a	Yeah .
41644	0	a	Yeah .
41645	0	a	Yeah .
41646	0	a	kay .
41647	0	a	So
41648	0	a	it is going to record your things and you
41649	0	a	and you you need basically the functionalities what you need in both video as well as in the standard TV thing .
41650	0	a	Yeah .
41651	0	a	That is fair enough .
41652	0	a	But I do not think we are trying to make a universal remote here .
41653	0	a	No no we are not making a universal remote ,
41654	0	a	we are just looking at giving a scenario , I have a TV and tomorrow I am going to have set up box which is going to sit there
41655	0	a	and it is going to do that job for me .
41656	0	a	That is ,
41657	0	a	yeah .
41658	0	a	Because y
41659	1	a	W w w w we need to decide on on on on in how far we go to in this .
41660	0	a	Mean , you can go pretty far
41661	0	a	I
41662	0	a	f
41663	0	a	I think with with with functions and possible future p prospects
41664	0	a	yes .
41665	0	a	Yep .
41666	0	a	Yeah .
41667	0	a	So Okay
41668	0	a	so
41669	0	a	that p ends my presentation .
41670	0	a	But it is good to keep in mind .
41671	0	a	Very well .
41672	0	a	Well .
41673	0	a	So
41674	1	a	we can always discuss about it
41675	0	a	for example the presently the video market actually this demand , video over demand or what we call it as , it is presently booming up actually
41676	0	a	so
41677	0	a	it i
41678	0	a	like people are providing like things like movies , you can select actually
41679	0	a	so
41680	0	a	you want to watch a movie and your p your provider gives a list of movies , and then you select those list .
41681	0	a	Yeah .
41682	0	a	Yeah .
41683	0	a	And it
41684	0	a	basically
41685	0	a	you go off , it downloads the movie , it gives for you and then when you come you want to loo watch it on your TV .
41686	0	a	Yeah .
41687	0	a	And thi this is going to come .
41688	0	a	Good .
41689	0	a	Or even you do not need to download it , it is streamed online
41690	0	a	yeah .
41691	0	a	Yeah it can be streamed online for you
41692	0	a	and you can say what time I want to watch the movie
41693	0	a	and
41694	0	a	Yeah
41695	0	a	so .
41696	0	a	Yeah .
41697	0	a	Yeah .
41698	0	a	, so u
41699	0	a	I have received some some some some well points of of thinking over of my account manager
41700	1	a	and I would like to share them with you .
41701	0	a	Yeah .
41702	0	a	first thing is teletext is a well known feature of televisions but it is it is getting used less and less .
41703	0	a	Yeah .
41704	0	a	That is that is especially because of the internet of course .
41705	1	a	So we should think about it .
41706	0	a	Do we include it , and do we give it a prominent prominent place on on on the on well huh on the remote mot control itself .
41707	0	a	as a in any case it is it is not used , well very much , but it is it is still used .
41708	0	a	further yes we must think , do we stay to to television only , the television as we as we all know it with with broadcasting signals and you ca not go back
41709	0	a	huh ,
41710	0	a	or do we go further as Matthew indicated by supporting recording devices ?
41711	0	a	indeed indeed .
41712	0	a	So
41713	0	a	DVDs and VCRs ?
41714	0	a	And and and the hard disk recorders .
41715	0	a	, furthermore , , w we need really need to interest y younger customers and then with younger customers
41716	0	a	I mean people below the age of forty , and our our current customers are mainly forty plus
41717	0	a	which
41718	0	a	well
41719	0	a	Forty .
41720	0	a	Fourteen
41721	0	a	or for O
41722	0	a	okay .
41723	0	a	So
41724	0	a	So
41725	0	a	that is to that is
41726	0	a	I mean there is a market
41727	0	a	but they will grow older older
41728	0	a	and you will al always need to have the the future with younger people .
41729	0	a	therefore ,
41730	0	a	younger people like trendy trendy designs ,
41731	1	a	so that is w we should make our our our RC as trendy as possible but it should also be have a reliable image ,
41732	0	a	so when it looks too too spacey or too fancy people will think well does it work at all .
41733	0	a	Yeah
41734	0	a	it is
41735	0	a	well
41736	1	a	you you can follow the ideas how you want to keep the keys ,
41737	0	a	you know
41738	0	a	right now if you take it you have like zero , one , two , three like a keys separately ,
41739	1	a	but suppose if you take the the present trend of mobile phones there are like big thick keys
41740	0	a	you press on the top , it takes one number , you press on the bottom it takes another number , and basically
41741	0	a	so the space covered
41742	0	a	so that you do not see two separate keys there actually
41743	0	a	so it it is like i
41744	0	a	i
41745	0	a	it is like
41746	0	a	Yeah
41747	0	a	so .
41748	1	a	Ma
41749	1	a	Maybe Maybe you can draw it on the on the board
41750	0	a	But I think taking the idea of getting inspiration from mobile phones is interesting , especially if we are going after a younger market ,
41751	0	a	that is the the the the new and the funky things ,
41752	0	a	that is ,
41753	0	a	yeah , there is lot there is lots of pretty mobile phones , not too many pretty remote controls .
41754	0	a	Yeah .
41755	0	a	Yes yes
41756	0	a	mo
41757	0	a	Yes
41758	0	a	it is recognisable
41759	0	a	Because they are already used to that , you know , product .
41760	0	a	Yeah .
41761	0	a	That is
41762	0	a	And and they are skilled by using it .
41763	0	a	So for example
41764	0	a	Well
41765	0	a	Okay , it works .
41766	0	a	Fine .
41767	0	a	So ,
41768	0	a	for example you have presently keys like one , two , three like this , actually , and four five six like that
41769	0	a	and you can have keys like this in form like keys like that
41770	0	a	Forty minutes ?
41771	0	a	Yeah
41772	0	a	so
41773	1	a	you you you can have keys like which are which are like so .
41774	0	a	Mael can you hand me over this ?
41775	0	a	thank you .
41776	0	a	Yes .
41777	0	a	Okay .
41778	0	a	How much longer have we got for the meeting by the way ?
41779	0	a	Cause we have not talked about demographic at all
41780	0	a	and it is a very important issue .
41781	0	a	well
41782	0	a	I think fi five min
41783	0	a	too sorry ,
41784	1	a	so we basically do not change the original order of them
41785	0	a	but then the keys are more spacious ,
41786	0	a	they do not look so there there is a very sligh thing ,
41787	0	a	so if you press on the top it takes the one , it takes the three , four , sorry four here five and six ,
41788	0	a	so the keys can be it looks you know not very much cluttered
41789	0	a	but it looks nice
41790	0	a	for you do not have too many keys
41791	1	a	but you can have a lot of options t if you press on the to
41792	0	a	Yeah .
41793	0	a	Okay .
41794	0	a	Kay
41795	0	a	I I think now that the idea is clear .
41796	0	a	Yep .
41797	1	a	we should now try to decide on our target group .
41798	0	a	Yeah .
41799	0	a	Which I think is quite tricky .
41800	0	a	Yeah .
41801	0	a	, basically we are trying to get people to buy a remote control
41802	0	a	would not they already have a remote control with their television when they buy one ?
41803	0	a	But it is not going to have more functionality , cause it is only a low market , it is a cheap end remote control , we ca not beat modern functionality , we might we will be able to beat them on th the look of it , th the design of it
41804	0	a	but that is not a big seller ,
41805	0	a	if
41806	0	a	they are not just going to buy a new remote control just cause it looks pretty , they have to actually need it as well .
41807	0	a	Of course they have already one .
41808	1	a	So our our our remote control has to be better .
41809	1	a	So I am not sure how we can get people to buy this thing .
41810	0	a	I well
41811	0	a	I think many people said in your in in your research the appearance of the RC is is important when they are buying one
41812	0	a	but
41813	0	a	Indeed .
41814	0	a	Yeah .
41815	0	a	But why are they buying one in the first place ?
41816	0	a	So
41817	0	a	that will be about functionality
41818	0	a	But if people are buying a new remote control for functionality they will buy a universal remote .
41819	0	a	I have got friends who have got so many things they need a universal remote , otherwise they are using five different remotes for their all their things .
41820	0	a	In that case they would not buy our product , because it does not give them what they need in terms of functionality .
41821	0	a	So your you think we should go for a more u universal high performance
41822	1	a	What do What do you think about
41823	0	a	What componen
41824	0	a	I do not know .
41825	0	a	Well ,
41826	0	a	we ca not , with the price range .
41827	0	a	We We are not building a universal remote , we are not building a high end product .
41828	0	a	Yeah
41829	0	a	we have
41830	0	a	yeah
41831	0	a	twelve point five Euros per per R s RC
41832	0	a	and I think with this
41833	0	a	now you know that chips are very cheaps
41834	1	a	and we can include it in our control some new new features .
41835	0	a	Yeah .
41836	0	a	And But yeah
41837	0	a	that is
41838	0	a	I do not think LCD is not necessary well , th for long term .
41839	0	a	But
41840	0	a	yeah .
41841	1	a	If we are getting into universal remote territory , we are getting to LCD screens and things like that
41842	0	a	which would drive the cost up a lot .
41843	0	a	I do not know whether that is necessary .
41844	0	a	Is the LCD screen
41845	0	a	I think thi this could be this could be a market because universal remote controls tend to be quite expensive .
41846	0	a	For universal remotes
41847	0	a	If you .
41848	0	a	And quite complicated to use ,
41849	0	a	yes .
41850	1	a	S
41851	1	a	so we can try to go in between , and offer a product which is not as expensive and not as complicated but but still but still people have the idea
41852	1	a	this is more functional than a normal RC
41853	0	a	because it has more it
41854	0	a	it is in some kind universal .
41855	1	a	Not as flexible maybe ,
41856	0	a	yeah ,
41857	0	a	but s
41858	0	a	yeah .
41859	0	a	Yeah .
41860	0	a	Universal .
41861	0	a	Yeah .
41862	0	a	But if we are going for the say fifteen to twenty five age group then not many of them would actually own TVs to use a remote control on .
41863	0	a	yes
41864	0	a	but w we are targeting I think on more on the on the twenty to forty group .
41865	0	a	Okay .
41866	0	a	So
41867	0	a	they are
41868	0	a	yeah .
41869	1	a	People yes .
41870	1	a	Who just have or already have a job and have the money but may not want to spend that much money on a on a universal universal control .
41871	0	a	Yep .
41872	0	a	I do not know really what the the price range for remote controls is .
41873	0	a	Are we going to be at the very bottom of the price range , or are we kind of middle to bottom ?
41874	0	a	I do not know .
41875	0	a	well
41876	0	a	I think
41877	0	a	when we think it over
41878	0	a	I thi
41879	0	a	I think we are trying to offer the a kind of universal control for for less money .
41880	0	a	Yeah .
41881	0	a	So
41882	0	a	d Do you agree ?
41883	0	a	Well Well I it is fine with me like the price as long as it is not too expensive .
41884	0	a	Yeah
41885	0	a	because we have to take into account that we are going to b we are going to sell four aro around four million
41886	0	a	so when we speak about these numbers the price of a chip is price of a chip is very cheap .
41887	0	a	and it d Our provin
41888	0	a	So
41889	0	a	I am okay for designing a ne less
41890	0	a	yeah
41891	0	a	a a kind of universal RC
41892	0	a	yeah .
41893	0	a	You think it is possible for the twelve Euro fifty ?
41894	0	a	Okay .
41895	0	a	Yeah .
41896	0	a	so
41897	0	a	then we we decide on on on going to this more universal kind of control .
41898	0	a	yeah ,
41899	0	a	that is that is what we needed basically .
41900	0	a	Okay .
41901	0	a	that is needed right now .
41902	0	a	And basically you can look to the standards of other Actu
41903	0	a	Yeah .
41904	0	a	Yeah that is needed , yeah .
41905	1	a	And if we want to get the market , we really need that .
41906	0	a	Yeah .
41907	0	a	Yeah .
41908	0	a	So
41909	1	a	I guess what I would like from a universal remote is maybe choosing between three devices , being able to switch between them , there may be stereo , VCR and TV .
41910	0	a	Yes .
41911	0	a	Exactly .
41912	1	a	And just be able to s use them all from the same remote , but not at the same time .
41913	0	a	Yes .
41914	0	a	Yeah
41915	1	a	you can also browse through all the standards you know , where are the limit of standards for all of them and you can just browse through them .
41916	0	a	Is that okay for you ?
41917	0	a	Yeah .
41918	0	a	Yeah .
41919	0	a	Yeah .
41920	0	a	So
41921	0	a	given we are going for this universal type m maybe it is good when you try to find out which components you therefore need and
41922	0	a	y you will try to get more specific user interface content
41923	0	a	and maybe you can look on on what trends are in this in this type of market .
41924	0	a	Yes .
41925	0	a	Okay .
41926	0	a	Okay .
41927	0	a	yep .
41928	0	a	Voila .
41929	0	a	So
41930	0	a	anyone has a point to bring in
41931	0	a	or shall we
41932	0	a	no .
41933	0	a	So .
41934	0	a	Well .
41935	0	a	Oh
41936	0	a	I do not have anything right now .
41937	1	a	We can we will we will go and we will I am sure we will up something good
41938	0	a	for the
41939	0	a	Yeah
41940	0	a	so
41941	0	a	we meet in well what are our
41942	0	a	Okay .
41943	0	a	Oh
41944	0	a	that is that is fine then .
41945	0	a	Okay .
41946	0	a	W
41947	0	a	yes ,
41948	1	a	we we can have lunch now .
41949	0	a	Yeah .
41950	0	a	So
41951	0	a	Then th th the next meeting
41952	0	a	will
41953	0	a	after lunch you have we have thirty minutes of work and then we have the next meeting .
41954	0	a	But you will be informed via the computer .
41955	0	a	Cool .
41956	0	a	 
41957	0	a	Right first time this time .
41958	0	a	Nu There we go .
41959	0	a	It is not that complicated , but I get it wrong every time .
41960	0	a	Okay so
41961	0	a	we are just waiting for Matthew .
41962	0	a	For Matthew , yep .
41963	0	a	So
41964	1	a	I suggest we start the meeting without Matthew
41965	0	a	he is obviously late for some reason .
41966	0	a	kay .
41967	0	a	Good .
41968	0	a	Today we will talk about conceptual design .
41969	0	a	I hope you both did some some work concerning a conceptual design .
41970	0	a	this will be the agenda for the meeting .
41971	0	a	I will take some minutes again .
41972	0	a	we will have the presentations of y of you different team members , and then try to come to decisions about the concepts you have presented .
41973	0	a	Yep .
41974	0	a	Yep .
41975	0	a	So
41976	0	a	and that will
41977	0	a	we have some forty minutes to complete this .
41978	0	a	So
41979	0	a	who has the fir
41980	0	a	do you ha
41981	0	a	Anna do you have your presentation ready ?
41982	0	a	Okay .
41983	0	a	I have a presentation ,

41985	0	a	Okay
41986	1	a	I will just email you this file , my presentation .
41987	0	a	Yeah
41988	0	a	I think yeah
41989	0	a	the Matthew
41990	0	a	it is it is important that Matthew yeah is here
41991	0	a	because it is really a a team project with a team
41992	1	a	and if someone is not here then we cannot
41993	0	a	but it is okay
41994	0	a	it is good .
41995	0	a	there is Matthew .
41996	0	a	Sorry .
41997	0	a	So .
41998	0	a	Good .
41999	0	a	Do presentation ready ?
42000	0	a	Oh okay .
42001	0	a	I am just emailing it to you .
42002	0	a	So
42003	0	a	Yeah I sent you the slides ,
42004	0	a	you did not see them ?
42005	0	a	Okay .
42006	0	a	So
42007	0	a	did you manage
42008	0	a	Oh yes I see him , good yes .
42009	0	a	No .
42010	0	a	So Kay .
42011	0	a	Okay it should have gone through to you .
42012	0	a	Okay yes I have it .
42013	0	a	Okay so
42014	0	a	this is just a presentation on the trends that we are going to use to make the product stand out from the rest of the products out there at the moment .
42015	0	a	can I just put this on ?
42016	0	a	So
42017	1	a	we have to work out a way what we can do with our product to make it stand out and make it so people want to buy it .
42018	0	a	This is to do this I will not remove my microphone .
42019	0	a	We basically used some focus group surveys which I went through with you last time , the main results of that , and some research on the current design and fashion trends that are out there at the moment ,
42020	0	a	and as part of this
42021	0	a	The important aspects that came out were things that we have already discussed really .
42022	0	a	The most important by far was the look and feel of it .
42023	1	a	It needs to be something that is very different from everything else out there .
42024	1	a	It needs to stand out .
42025	1	a	It needs to be not functional like the rest of the things out there at the moment .
42026	0	a	Most people find remote controls boring at the moment , we need to have something that looks interesting , that looks exciting , that will stand out .
42027	0	a	People will want to buy it .
42028	0	a	That was twice as i important as the next item on here which is that it has to be technologically innovative
42029	1	a	has to have something else , apart from just the look of it .
42030	0	a	People have to then think about it and say got something there that I want .
42031	0	a	That is a really cool feature ,
42032	1	a	and it has to make them want to buy it again .
42033	0	a	Third on the list , and again innovative was twice as important as this last aspect , it has to be easy to use .
42034	1	a	So they have to be able to be able to look at it and have some intuitive idea of how to use it .
42035	0	a	Drawing on the fashion trends at the moment , fruit and vegetables .
42036	0	a	This is basically talking about just the the feel of it , so probably not the smell of it , but the bright colours , eye catching , really bold designs , and a spongy feel .
42037	0	a	I had a talk to the design people about this ,
42038	0	a	but having a remote that is tactile , that feels different , that would be really cool .
42039	0	a	That would make it stand out .
42040	0	a	So
42041	0	a	can you repeat and be more precise about what you just said ?
42042	0	a	about the feeling
42043	0	a	yeah
42044	0	a	yo
42045	0	a	Okay .
42046	0	a	Spongy feel ?
42047	0	a	Well
42048	0	a	ma make it not necessar sp
42049	0	a	spongy is the current thing .
42050	0	a	You can
42051	0	a	Yeah .
42052	0	a	Spongy is the current texture , but basically there are no reports no remotes at the moment which are spongy or tactile at all ,
42053	1	a	so if we make it like maybe furry or soft or something , that will be something that sets it apart ,
42054	0	a	rather than just bare plastic which they all are at the moment .
42055	0	a	Yeah .
42056	0	a	Okay .
42057	0	a	So
42058	0	a	as far as the design goes , the very most important aspect was the design , to the customers .
42059	0	a	So
42060	0	a	going with the fruit and vegetable idea , we have got the bright colours , so makes it stand out , the oranges and the the bright yellows and the florescent colours , part of the fruit and vegetables .
42061	0	a	Going back to the idea of taking inspiration from mobile phones ,
42062	0	a	they have all got those
42063	0	a	a lot of them have the changeable covers , so they can choose what colour the outside is .
42064	1	a	That is one way of looking at it .
42065	0	a	Textured feel we just talked about .
42066	1	a	Maybe it is another way of doing that .
42067	1	a	So if it is part of the the changeable covers then may maybe they can choose a different texture , a spongy one or a soft one or something like that .
42068	1	a	So they can choose it li as they want to to maybe to fit in with their decor in their living room , or just what they like , their sports team or whatever .
42069	0	a	Yeah that is a very good idea , yeah .
42070	0	a	Yeah .
42071	0	a	and yeah ,
42072	1	a	still taking the inspiration from the mobile phone design so functionality , the way the mobile phones work , the way the keypad looks .
42073	0	a	Also just the way that a lot of industrial design is going into mobile phones at the moment .
42074	0	a	They are big selling items .
42075	0	a	People put a lot of thought into that
42076	1	a	so we can leverage off that , and we can start using some of their ideas .
42077	0	a	back to technological in in innovation , not quite as important , but still a big issue .
42078	0	a	we talked about having a way of finding a remote control if it is been lost ,
42079	1	a	that is one thing we could look at .
42080	0	a	There are other aspects like LCD screens and speech recognition which were not I do not think , in my personal opinion , going to be worth the extra expense and the extra effort that will go into them .
42081	0	a	I think we are better doing something basic like this which is very important and very will be a really cool feature to put in .
42082	0	a	And use .
42083	0	a	I had no real specific ideas for this ,
42084	1	a	maybe we just , the basic idea of having your core functions big and at the top maybe , by themselves ,
42085	0	a	and then
42086	0	a	yeah
42087	1	a	and then th th the finer details of buttons you do not use as much either hidden away or completely separate .
42088	0	a	Yes well
42089	1	a	maybe Matthew can can give some more information on the
42090	0	a	Voila .
42091	0	a	Yep and that is the presentation .
42092	0	a	Okay good ,
42093	0	a	that is very clear .
42094	0	a	Yeah very clear .
42095	0	a	Yeah .
42096	0	a	Kay .
42097	0	a	So
42098	0	a	does anyone have any comments or ideas on that ?
42099	0	a	I think you
42100	1	a	Maybe we yes well we maybe can decide later on the l the the look and feel
42101	0	a	of I have
42102	0	a	it was a good idea maybe to to
42103	0	a	Yes the the the there are changeable covers , but on the other hand I I do not know whether my superiors would be so glad with it because you have to introduce a complete new l line of of supplies it would be very complicated organisational
42104	0	a	To let the people choose , you mean ?
42105	0	a	Yeah .
42106	0	a	Well
42107	0	a	we are selling so many units of this .
42108	0	a	This is going to be a mass marketed product , we can afford to have two or three different designs at least .
42109	0	a	Yeah a range of yeah , a set of three , four different aspects .
42110	0	a	Yes .
42111	0	a	Sure that fits the
42112	0	a	Yeah .
42113	0	a	Yes
42114	0	a	and of course it will be a we we get a
42115	0	a	if it works we can get after sales
42116	0	a	I mean that would would be very good
42117	1	a	I mean those covers could go for for three , five Euro .
42118	0	a	That is a very good idea
42119	1	a	And then maybe we can go a th Matthew is presentation
42120	0	a	because the
42121	0	a	Together indeed ,
42122	0	a	because you ma might have some some information on the the easy to use , what you were already mentioning .
42123	0	a	Yeah
42124	0	a	s
42125	1	a	then we could discuss later
42126	0	a	like
42127	1	a	we can put all ideas together .
42128	0	a	Yeah
42129	0	a	yeah
42130	0	a	I agree .
42131	0	a	It should be easier with that .
42132	0	a	Yeah .
42133	0	a	, yeah .
42134	0	a	Yeah .
42135	0	a	And your part is very related to mine because when you suggest something then it has to be integrated inside .
42136	0	a	So
42137	0	a	Yeah .
42138	0	a	Yeah
42139	0	a	so
42140	1	a	I will I will go with that actually
42141	0	a	so Okay so m
42142	0	a	so
42143	0	a	then the the idea of having a remote is generally you have different keys and different structures , different forms , and they could be like buttons and they could be of a varying sizes if you want to to basically emphasize a particular key more than the other , and maybe like you can have different colours for example having the r red for the on off switching on and off the button .
42144	0	a	So this this is the general trend to ha the method they do .
42145	0	a	Yeah .
42146	0	a	So what I have found was that currently the they are mostly that the TV , VCR , music system operated ones actually , and they are very specific to each other , but there are some common keys
42147	1	a	for example if you want to follow the VCR and if you want to follow the g
42148	1	a	s some soundtrack on the w
42149	1	a	w see they have the common thing actually
42150	1	a	you can have
42151	0	a	and
42152	0	a	There is also a speech recognition to store channel information , names ,
42153	0	a	like You can basically
42154	0	a	if you have a multiple functionality , say TV , VCR or something
42155	0	a	I say it to the TV and the TV , and you can programme the keys if you want to , certain keys are even the channel information .
42156	0	a	I like the idea though of having speech recognition for like the n the name of a channel like BBC , rather than having to remember the the number of it on the keypad .
42157	0	a	Yeah yeah
42158	0	a	so you you
42159	0	a	you can just
42160	0	a	because as more and more channels come then you have more and more problems to remember the v v exact channel numbers ex exactly , even if you arrange it by however you arrange it , you still have the problem to remember exactly which channel you want to
42161	0	a	So
42162	0	a	it it
42163	0	a	it is like
42164	0	a	it limited one .
42165	0	a	That is a good idea .
42166	0	a	Yeah .
42167	0	a	Yeah I really like that idea .
42168	0	a	So
42169	1	a	what functionalities do you suggest for that ?
42170	1	a	For facing this problem ?
42171	0	a	Okay .
42172	0	a	In the present market I saw it that says something like they are looking for eighty word thing , eighty word , which should not be th that difficult to implement , like eighty to hundred word .
42173	1	a	Basically you want you do not want to store all the channels in the remote control , you want to st store your favourite channel .
42174	1	a	Maybe ten channels , yeah at the most .
42175	0	a	Yeah some ten twelve channel information .
42176	0	a	You know
42177	1	a	you do not want to st store all the hundred channel information into that .
42178	0	a	And basically
42179	0	a	it depends
42180	1	a	like the remote with LCD display for browsing
42181	0	a	because you have multiple functionalities for example you are watching a movie , and you are having a universal remote control and you want to you do not know really which functionality is now ,
42182	0	a	so I am using the TV
42183	0	a	so every time I use it , it could be like ,
42184	1	a	for example I can use a simple toggle switch , and a display , so I press it
42185	1	a	so the display says , okay , I am in TV or DVD or whatever it is , instead of having three keys separately for four keys ,
42186	0	a	to model the functionalities will increase actually ,
42187	0	a	and for you and you might want
42188	0	a	you do not want separate keys for all of them .
42189	0	a	Oh yeah
42190	0	a	yeah
42191	0	a	yeah .
42192	0	a	You ca not .
42193	0	a	And well
42194	0	a	there can be children friendly where you can programme your remote so that they they are not allowed to browse certain channels which you can block them , and you can operate them .
42195	0	a	So these are the things presently which are seen in the market scenarios at present .
42196	1	a	I personally would look at things like having a u universal remote ,
42197	0	a	is is a good idea ,
42198	0	a	like
42199	1	a	instead of having unusual ones for all of them you can think of having , with multiple functionality possibly with speech recognition .
42200	0	a	I got a mail from the the coffee machine interface unit that they have integrated the s speech recognition into a into the coffee machine , and so if you say hello coffee machine , it say hi Joe , or something like that ,
42201	0	a	you know , and
42202	0	a	Yeah
42203	0	a	you you wo not be using it , so it is a limited vocabulary thing , and very isolated word
42204	0	a	and it is it is interesting , and basically storing the channel through voice or other ways of programming your keys , on the display for the browsing
42205	0	a	which is again
42206	1	a	and maybe having something like a blinking thing , like it could indicate you are it it could indicate what is cal like the whether you you have enough battery in your in your remote , the blinking .
42207	0	a	b
42208	0	a	But a coffee machine , there is not too many words they would be using with that it is a
42209	0	a	it is a small vocabulary .
42210	0	a	Yeah .
42211	1	a	At the same time , if it is a dark room , it can be used to locate the remote also
42212	0	a	or
42213	0	a	Yeah you can let them to do that .
42214	0	a	And you want
42215	0	a	okay
42216	0	a	for
42217	1	a	coming back to one point
42218	0	a	y you want to let the user to programming the keys ?
42219	0	a	Some of them ?
42220	0	a	And is not that too difficult
42221	0	a	for the we want w
42222	0	a	I do not know if we still want the RC to be easy to use ,
42223	0	a	that is the compromise .
42224	0	a	Two thirty five supposed to finish .
42225	0	a	N no
42226	0	a	but the if you give
42227	0	a	it d depends on the easiness like the user how much effort he can put .
42228	0	a	Yeah .
42229	0	a	Like for example I would like to store in certain way ,
42230	1	a	so if you want to give the full freedom to the user or you want to keep some constraints and let the user use it with that constraint .
42231	0	a	Yeah .
42232	0	a	Yeah .
42233	0	a	Yeah .
42234	1	a	I think you can do it both ways .
42235	0	a	So it de
42236	0	a	So So
42237	0	a	Yeah .
42238	1	a	You can have it so it is easy they can pick it up and use it straight away without doing anythi without customizing it , or if they want to they have the option of using these extra features .
42239	1	a	A standard .
42240	0	a	Yeah .
42241	0	a	yes
42242	0	a	but but I do
42243	1	a	maybe you can give a hand to us
42244	0	a	because I I am not sure whether that that we can implement that for twelve Euro and fifty cents .
42245	0	a	Yeah .
42246	0	a	I am sorry to have Every time I have to come down on this price again
42247	0	a	to
42248	0	a	so this might be a little limiting for your creativity ,
42249	0	a	but it is it is it is the real
42250	1	a	We have to consider it .
42251	0	a	S
42252	0	a	so
42253	0	a	do we think these ideas an and my sp speech recognition , I mean maybe it is possible for for twelve Euro
42254	0	a	but then then it will be at cost of other functionality
42255	0	a	we might implement like the the the the furry case of the
42256	0	a	Yeah .
42257	0	a	yeah like
42258	0	a	I would say that for programming keys , you said , it could be easily done within the the package of twel twelve Euros ,
42259	0	a	but for the ASR system , I am not sure if it is feasible to have this
42260	0	a	We
42261	0	a	Exactly yeah
42262	1	a	i if if it is a low vocabulary it is already implemented , and w how much it is cost , maybe with a f cheap chip .
42263	0	a	Yeah .
42264	0	a	We well
42265	0	a	we can still look at
42266	1	a	we can talk with the coffee unit
42267	0	a	and you can check how much how much they
42268	0	a	yeah
42269	0	a	yeah
42270	0	a	yeah .
42271	1	a	Maybe we can come we
42272	1	a	we can talk to them , and we can come with that ,
42273	0	a	you know .
42274	0	a	Yeah .
42275	0	a	And also well you can think of having since you have a
42276	0	a	you know something
42277	1	a	maybe if you added little bit of display ,
42278	0	a	you might need the to che keep checking the battery ,
42279	1	a	so you really need a some kind of indicator , so it could be a blinking option of LED it could actually be used to detect also .
42280	0	a	Yeah .
42281	0	a	If it is in a dark room you can basically detect it also .
42282	0	a	Yeah .
42283	0	a	So
42284	0	a	No
42285	0	a	actually
42286	0	a	i if i it is like
42287	0	a	you know
42288	0	a	it tells you ,
42289	1	a	it can be for two purposes ,
42290	0	a	like if you have an LCD display and all those things it is not going to be the standard remote ,
42291	0	a	which is having
42292	0	a	which need just six six volt th sorry three volts of DC .
42293	0	a	I like the idea too of being able to use the remote in the dark ,
42294	1	a	so either having the buttons so you can feel the difference between them or if they if they light up or something .
42295	0	a	It may need more actually , so y you you may need to check your battery usage
42296	0	a	it
42297	0	a	and then you need that , some functionality to indicate the battery limit .
42298	0	a	It is true .
42299	1	a	And then if the battery limit is indicated , if it could be ind indicated through a blinking something and it can change the colour depending on your how much is the battery ,
42300	0	a	well
42301	1	a	that is good enough to even locate even if you want to .
42302	0	a	You know .
42303	0	a	Kay good .
42304	0	a	Yeah
42305	0	a	so
42306	0	a	You you have time some more ?
42307	0	a	Yep .
42308	0	a	I do not know how if if I have time to talk about the
42309	0	a	Okay .
42310	0	a	yes
42311	0	a	I would
42312	0	a	Yes yes
42313	0	a	you
42314	0	a	can you can still .
42315	0	a	We have time .
42316	0	a	Sure you can you know .
42317	0	a	So
42318	1	a	what I am going to present here is very
42319	1	a	yeah
42320	1	a	basic knowledge about the all the the components that are inside a a RC a remote control , and how is it manufactured h what is the process , just to explain you .
42321	0	a	So
42322	0	a	the method is ther
42323	0	a	there is a a set of components in a in a remote control
42324	0	a	like , and what cost
42325	0	a	the the components in themself do not cost a lot but the the way to assemble everything costs obviously ,
42326	1	a	and I will show you my preferences at the end .
42327	0	a	So
42328	0	a	there are two different types of Two different ways of using the the components for making a a remote control .
42329	0	a	Nice .
42330	0	a	the basic way is to use a an integrated circuit and some transistors with an that aims at communicating the message and to to send the message to the to the led that will transmit to the receiver .
42331	0	a	And yeah
42332	0	a	the other components and the circuit board buttons , infrared , led , etcetera , for the components
42333	0	a	So
42334	0	a	you finding ,
42335	0	a	just to say that the chip can detect when a key is pressed , and then it translate to the key , to a sequence , something like morse code , as you know , with a different sequence for each key ,
42336	0	a	and
42337	0	a	that is ,
42338	0	a	with the components we will use , we will have different messages , different sequences , and the chips sends that signal signal to the transistor that amplify to make it stronger
42339	0	a	So
42340	0	a	electronic parts are assembled onto printed boards because it is easier to mass produce and assemble .
42341	0	a	And so
42342	1	a	I think for our design we want some b programmable you know V VLSI or FPGA high technology ,
42343	0	a	and this is important ,
42344	1	a	and also we will use yeah like in any high tech devices a chip of fi fibreglass to them and connect them .
42345	0	a	Yeah .
42346	0	a	So
42347	1	a	my personal design
42348	1	a	we need to find a solution what what is the material of the cover we want to use .
42349	1	a	If it is plastic
42350	0	a	or you said that yeah you had some ideas like fruit , veg or
42351	0	a	I dunno .
42352	0	a	Well well
42353	1	a	m m maybe m maybe we can give the the the case a very normal a v very normal case but , with the changeable covers to fancy it up .
42354	0	a	Yes .
42355	0	a	Yes .
42356	1	a	So like a normal cheap plastic case which can be covered up in , for instance , a wooden case .
42357	0	a	Yeah .
42358	0	a	Yes .
42359	0	a	just have a yeah
42360	0	a	Just the veneer on it ,
42361	0	a	yeah .
42362	0	a	Yeah
42363	0	a	like they do in with cars
42364	0	a	I think .
42365	0	a	Yeah inside the car
42366	0	a	yeah .
42367	0	a	So
42368	0	a	they also emailed me that they have available a bunch of different buttons , a scroll wheels , integrated push buttons s such as a computer mouse .
42369	0	a	Yeah .
42370	0	a	And very cheap LCDs , so liquid crystal displays ,
42371	1	a	so I am wondering , I think we might be able to integrate LCD into our RC .
42372	1	a	And the final point okay is we have
42373	1	a	yeah
42374	1	a	there are some compromise to to do .
42375	0	a	So
42376	0	a	we have to know that the push button requires a simple chip , but the scroll wheel and that kind of higher high tech stuff needs more money which is a higher price range
42377	0	a	alright .
42378	0	a	And the display requires an advanced chip , which in turns is more expensive than the regular chip , but I think with twelve Euros and if it is made for four million items , then I think w we could be able to handle that .
42379	0	a	So
42380	1	a	to to sum up
42381	0	a	we need
42382	0	a	yeah
42383	0	a	so
42384	0	a	I
42385	0	a	I just said that the components the list of components has to be yeah listed and and assembly is a an important process
42386	1	a	that has to be taken into account .
42387	1	a	And for the designing of the cove cover layout then it is better to to to maybe see that with the the UR exp URI Expert so that we can it is really a team working
42388	0	a	Sorry .
42389	0	a	So
42390	0	a	I I cannot design something without your agreement ,
42391	0	a	right ?
42392	0	a	Yes .
42393	0	a	Yeah
42394	0	a	so
42395	0	a	of course
42396	0	a	for example I wanted to know like if you want to have a a fo if you want to have the LCD display over there , or if you want to store a programmes with a keys
42397	1	a	What kind of things you will need inside your thin inside
42398	0	a	W wh what W
42399	0	a	what
42400	0	a	Okay .
42401	0	a	No of course .
42402	0	a	Yeah
42403	1	a	it is kind of simple pro progra programmable device , and we have to insert .
42404	1	a	I think we could insert one that could underlie several functions
42405	0	a	of
42406	0	a	Exactly yeah , for customizing
42407	0	a	and
42408	0	a	yeah .
42409	0	a	Okay .
42410	0	a	Okay so
42411	1	a	in that case you can even look at the technology what the mobile phone is trying to use with the card .
42412	0	a	Yeah
42413	0	a	where they do all the wi with with them actually .
42414	0	a	Okay .
42415	1	a	How f cost effective it would be to put that car chip into it and do the programmable things .
42416	0	a	Yeah .
42417	0	a	So So
42418	0	a	I f
42419	1	a	I think we we should come to some decisions now a about this .
42420	0	a	Yeah good idea .
42421	0	a	Yeah .
42422	0	a	so
42423	0	a	I understand when we want a display we need a expensive chip , but when we want a scrolling wheel w we also need the expensive chip ,
42424	1	a	so can we use same chip ,
42425	0	a	so with one expensive chip we can implement several complicated or advanced features .
42426	0	a	Exactly yeah that is a very good idea ,
42427	1	a	we could have one main chip that could handle , it is called FPGA chip , that could handle both like scrolling wheels as well as LCD
42428	0	a	and
42429	0	a	yeah .
42430	0	a	Yes .
42431	0	a	So
42432	1	a	when the more expensive chip you mentioned there is is possible in the in the given budget , maybe we should go for for the more expensive chip ,
42433	0	a	so all features which you mentioned can be implemented based on the same chip .
42434	0	a	Yes .
42435	0	a	D
42436	0	a	well Well
42437	0	a	I do not know if it will fit into our cost of twelve point five Euro you know .
42438	0	a	Do you think that is feasible ?
42439	0	a	You th you think it is possible .
42440	0	a	Is it possible to fit in to that ?
42441	0	a	Sorry .
42442	0	a	Yeah
42443	0	a	also thinking ,
42444	0	a	I think both if we had a budget of twenty twenty Euros , it will be okay ,
42445	0	a	but .
42446	0	a	Well
42447	0	a	maybe we need specific costings then .
42448	0	a	Actually
42449	1	a	do maybe two designs and then cost them out and see which one is going to fit in our budget better .
42450	0	a	Yeah that is an excellent idea .
42451	0	a	yes
42452	1	a	wh when you make a a design ca you can next meeting you can give an quite an exact cost price .
42453	0	a	Yeah yeah .
42454	0	a	That w that would be a very good idea .
42455	0	a	Yeah
42456	0	a	because right now I do not have price in in head
42457	1	a	but for next meeting I am sure yeah be able to do that .
42458	0	a	Good good .
42459	0	a	Yeah
42460	0	a	that is that is something which I wanted to ask you also ,
42461	0	a	like what will be the each individually the cost of it .
42462	0	a	Yeah .
42463	1	a	For example if f if you want to put wood I would not suggest for wood cause it is
42464	1	a	I think it is m much easier to use a plastic or a rubber rather than wood .
42465	0	a	Okay .
42466	0	a	I agree on that .
42467	0	a	Yeah .
42468	0	a	It will be much ch much expensive th though it is the most natural thing ,
42469	0	a	but
42470	0	a	Yeah .
42471	0	a	Yes
42472	0	a	but I can
42473	1	a	I think I think we can just use more cheap plastic for a kind of basic edition , and then people can fancy it up with with more expensive materials which which come with a with another price .
42474	0	a	Yeah
42475	0	a	it is
42476	0	a	Yeah we we can give a preference to them ,
42477	0	a	but it is
42478	0	a	but with plastic or the rubber or whatever it is it is much better with that rather than going for
42479	0	a	Yeah .
42480	0	a	Do do you agree ?
42481	0	a	Ma I
42482	1	a	I think for next meeting we c
42483	1	a	you two can present a real design .
42484	0	a	Yeah
42485	0	a	but i it is a detailed yeah
42486	0	a	yeah
42487	0	a	plastic versus wood ,
42488	1	a	and we need maybe to centre our description on the the really the what buttons what functionality we want to offer to the user , and maybe with graphs
42489	1	a	or I do not know User Interface Designer
42490	1	a	you could maybe help us on that .
42491	0	a	yeah sure .
42492	0	a	Yeah .
42493	0	a	Yeah .
42494	0	a	Yea
42495	0	a	Okay .
42496	1	a	so drawing it on the board .
42497	0	a	Perfect
42498	0	a	yeah .
42499	1	a	And then we now sh only have to t to decide the general function .
42500	0	a	So
42501	1	a	Let let is say next meeting w you produce two designs , one one one less advanced and one more advanced and with the cost price .
42502	0	a	Yeah sure .
42503	0	a	Yeah
42504	0	a	we will
42505	0	a	Yeah .
42506	0	a	Yeah .
42507	0	a	furthermore we go for the for the basic plastic case which can be later fancied up with with addit additional , how do you call them , these like like mobile telephones you can put a cover over it .
42508	0	a	Yeah .
42509	1	a	But that that that that can be done later .
42510	0	a	Yeah customized .
42511	1	a	We now can concentrate on the on the basic remote control .
42512	0	a	Okay .
42513	1	a	We can give them smooth keys ,
42514	0	a	you know .
42515	0	a	Smooth keys with bigger s
42516	0	a	So that you know
42517	0	a	The the problem most of the time we have seen , the keys is that it is small ,
42518	0	a	and every time we have to be very
42519	0	a	but if i
42520	0	a	the if we
42521	1	a	if we go to a different ways of designing those keys , then you can merge them together
42522	0	a	to
42523	0	a	Oh
42524	0	a	you can actually , for example , if you see , they are they are they are quite small over here ,
42525	0	a	and now you can ,
42526	1	a	for example , as I was if you make them big , it may change the look of the thing also to the people .
42527	0	a	Yeah .
42528	0	a	So
42529	0	a	is there any of these that you are looking at particularly or is this just ideas ?
42530	0	a	At the same time , it is m more like it would be more interesting for people who are having this RSI and all problem .
42531	0	a	yeah .
42532	0	a	Yes yes yes bi big keys is is good thing I think .
42533	0	a	big keys may better for them actually and
42534	0	a	Yeah .
42535	0	a	You see ?
42536	0	a	Yeah .
42537	0	a	I agree
42538	0	a	yeah ,
42539	1	a	and not too m too many keys of course
42540	1	a	yeah .
42541	0	a	No no .
42542	0	a	well
42543	0	a	one I have had before , a r r remote control we have at home is one that is actually got a cover on the bottom
42544	0	a	so the bottom bit is just , covers half the keys most of the time , and then you can slide the cover back to get to the the more advanced keys .
42545	0	a	w
42546	0	a	but then you have still have
42547	0	a	when you do not use it you have such a a an extent of your remote control which you do not use .
42548	0	a	Yeah .
42549	1	a	So maybe it is possible , I do not know whether you can can indicate this , that you can elsewhere open your remote control and on the inside are buttons you do not use that much .
42550	0	a	Yeah .
42551	0	a	Yeah .
42552	0	a	yeah
42553	0	a	I have seen that before too .
42554	0	a	Yeah .
42555	0	a	Anoth another like b
42556	0	a	it flips up and then you have got another layer of buttons underneath .
42557	0	a	Yes .
42558	0	a	Yes .
42559	0	a	Yeah
42560	0	a	so it is something like this , the model here
42561	0	a	s you can put the keys
42562	0	a	Yeah .
42563	0	a	But I have seen also with keys and buttons on the top of here as well .
42564	0	a	That is what you mean ?
42565	0	a	Yeah I like also this one .
42566	0	a	Yes I
42567	0	a	I th
42568	0	a	that is what I mean
42569	1	a	so I mean something like like a book .
42570	0	a	Yeah .
42571	0	a	I like this one .
42572	0	a	I like the shape of this one .
42573	0	a	Yeah .
42574	0	a	Can we have
42575	0	a	can we think about maybe having a a non recta non non rectangular one , so with not just the straight little box
42576	0	a	that is a
42577	1	a	maybe curved or something .
42578	0	a	Yeah ,
42579	0	a	the point is w
42580	1	a	maybe we need to also to make a decision on how how how big we want to be and how many buttons like n we should dec decide numbers or
42581	0	a	Okay .
42582	0	a	Yeah , .
42583	0	a	kay .
42584	0	a	We should make a
42585	0	a	Yeah
42586	0	a	that yeah
42587	0	a	next meeting
42588	0	a	we should be
42589	0	a	Yeah
42590	0	a	that would depend upon us actually .
42591	0	a	Is this for the next meeting though ?
42592	0	a	I think we might be out of time out of time for this meeting .
42593	1	a	Ju just make two designs , and the we we can decide decide between th those designs .
42594	0	a	Yeah
42595	0	a	yeah
42596	0	a	yeah .
42597	0	a	Yep .
42598	0	a	Yeah okay .
42599	0	a	I think that would be a good idea .
42600	0	a	Perfect .
42601	0	a	So
42602	0	a	anyone any questions for now ?
42603	0	a	yes
42604	1	a	I come to that
42605	0	a	Yes well
42606	0	a	m maybe
42607	0	a	, I do not know whether that is possible ,
42608	1	a	maybe you can start evaluating their work somehow .
42609	0	a	No no .
42610	0	a	No .
42611	0	a	I do not have .
42612	0	a	So
42613	0	a	is this
42614	1	a	is there anything else I need to do from a marketing point of view for the next meeting ?
42615	1	a	Maybe it would be interesting if you could look for the cost inventories of other devices , if you are using speech recognition or something like that .
42616	0	a	Okay
42617	0	a	well
42618	0	a	is this me designing a way to evaluate it
42619	0	a	so
42620	0	a	Thinking about how to set up test groups and things ?
42621	0	a	I do not know whether that is possible in the given time
42622	0	a	but a as far as possible .
42623	0	a	Okay .
42624	0	a	So
42625	0	a	you two will be together w working on a o on two prototypes and further instructions will be will be sent to you by by email .
42626	0	a	Yep .
42627	0	a	Exactly .
42628	0	a	Yeah .
42629	1	a	Two or three prototypes ?
42630	0	a	Two ?
42631	0	a	Okay .
42632	1	a	Two .
42633	1	a	Two .
42634	1	a	One for like cost and the one with like higher end
42635	0	a	so that then we can be easily comparing them or you know find a compromise between both of them ,
42636	0	a	yeah that is how it is .
42637	0	a	I and then
42638	0	a	Yeah
42639	0	a	and find maybe a compromise .
42640	0	a	Yes okay .
42641	0	a	Perfect
42642	0	a	yeah .
42643	0	a	Yep .
42644	0	a	Okay
42645	0	a	kay .
42646	0	a	Okay .
42647	0	a	So
42648	0	a	we are done for now .
42649	0	a	 
42650	0	a	Did you get my email with the slides ?
42651	0	a	Tricky .
42652	1	a	I guess I have to change the pen
42653	0	a	otherwise .
42654	0	a	Will be completely different .
42655	0	a	Dunno .
42656	0	a	Maybe they are supposed the pen is supposed to go over the seats .
42657	0	a	Might be seat floor rather than person .
42658	0	a	Yeah ,
42659	1	a	put it back .
42660	0	a	Yeah .
42661	0	a	And do you think it is .
42662	0	a	Yep .
42663	0	a	Yeah .
42664	0	a	Jo is making faces at me .
42665	0	a	Okay .
42666	0	a	Yeah .
42667	0	a	So .
42668	0	a	Matthew is late again .
42669	0	a	Probably an important man .
42670	0	a	So well
42671	0	a	it is important for him to be here .
42672	0	a	Yeah .
42673	0	a	So what can you ?
42674	0	a	Yeah we will
42675	0	a	yeah ,
42676	0	a	so I will be able to to summarize our meeting ,
42677	0	a	but still I think it would be in very important if the as main designer .
42678	0	a	He he he
42679	0	a	You did work together did not you ?
42680	0	a	Yes .
42681	0	a	I think we can put on the here .
42682	0	a	Yes .
42683	0	a	Yes .
42684	0	a	basically w yeah
42685	0	a	we we designed the two items .
42686	0	a	yes
42687	0	a	but w we
42688	0	a	Yes , maybe we should phone him .
42689	0	a	, can we have a phone ,
42690	0	a	can someone
42691	0	a	it is really w well designed .
42692	0	a	well ,
42693	0	a	when he is not here
42694	1	a	we will just we just have to continue .
42695	0	a	, object tracking .
42696	0	a	so
42697	0	a	just for record
42698	0	a	I
42699	0	a	I will take notes again .
42700	0	a	Yeah .
42701	0	a	Okay .
42702	0	a	And well
42703	0	a	first thing I was
42704	0	a	I got an email from from my superior again that we really should stay within the budget of the twelve Euro and fifty cents .
42705	0	a	Kay .
42706	0	a	when you stay in it is good ,
42707	0	a	when you do not stay in you have to redesign .
42708	0	a	There is no no negotiation possible in this matter .
42709	1	a	So we have to consider that .
42710	0	a	Yep .
42711	0	a	Good .
42712	0	a	so
42713	1	a	maybe Anna , you can have your presentation .
42714	0	a	Well
42715	0	a	we ca not no
42716	0	a	we ca not do evaluation until we have a design .
42717	0	a	Okay
42718	0	a	Matthew .
42719	0	a	Nice you are here .
42720	0	a	Great .
42721	0	a	Great .
42722	0	a	Great .
42723	0	a	Oh
42724	1	a	ma maybe then you can start now with presenting your your designs .
42725	0	a	Yep .
42726	0	a	So
42727	1	a	I will start by the the basic one
42728	0	a	that fits into eight Euros actually , right , seven eight Euros ,
42729	0	a	and well
42730	0	a	first for both they have a special shape ,
42731	0	a	maybe the designer can explain better than me ,
42732	0	a	but it is like a surf board .
42733	1	a	And you you are supposed to surf to browse to surf TV , maybe the web ,
42734	0	a	and it is kind of interesting shape
42735	0	a	because unconsciously people want to s to surf when they see this stuff .
42736	0	a	kay .
42737	0	a	Or browse .
42738	0	a	And also it is not too far from a mobile .
42739	0	a	So people are used to that kind of shape ,
42740	0	a	right .
42741	1	a	Do not take care too much about the colour
42742	0	a	because w
42743	0	a	yeah
42744	0	a	we do not take
42745	0	a	yeah .
42746	0	a	Now we are supposed to give some oper offers right now .
42747	0	a	So
42748	0	a	here would be basically the the the infrared led
42749	0	a	yeah
42750	0	a	LA LA LED ,
42751	0	a	the on off button , in red .
42752	0	a	Eye .
42753	0	a	I yeah .
42754	0	a	LED .
42755	0	a	Here would be the volume .
42756	0	a	Oh yeah .
42757	0	a	On the on the left ,
42758	0	a	okay , so
42759	0	a	easy to turn on t and off .
42760	0	a	Uh huh .
42761	0	a	Yes .
42762	0	a	And so
42763	0	a	this is a very cheap version
42764	0	a	so there are
42765	1	a	maybe you can carry on Matthew .
42766	0	a	Also so you have browsing the channels , actually so you can go up and down the channels , , if you have a video or something you can forward , back .
42767	0	a	Yeah .
42768	0	a	How can you change from VCR to TV , by the way ?
42769	0	a	Okay yeah .
42770	0	a	Oh
42771	0	a	no no no ,
42772	0	a	this is a single this
42773	0	a	this is a model with just the TV one .
42774	0	a	No no
42775	0	a	just
42776	0	a	sorry ,
42777	0	a	this is a standard TV one , we are not talking about that .
42778	0	a	Yeah yeah .
42779	0	a	, okay .
42780	0	a	So
42781	0	a	and then we have usually there twelve keys
42782	0	a	but we know that we rel that we have only ten digits .
42783	0	a	The extra two are for having or giving an option for having more than one channel .
42784	0	a	And the other one is for the teletext or something you want to browse through from that .
42785	0	a	Yeah .
42786	0	a	Okay so
42787	0	a	it is it is t a very basic remote then ,
42788	0	a	it is only
42789	0	a	Actually .
42790	0	a	It is a very basic minimal thing
42791	0	a	which you can
42792	0	a	which is which is also available in the market ,
42793	0	a	actually that is what it that
42794	0	a	it i
42795	0	a	and would cost us to build it about eight Euros .
42796	0	a	Yeah .
42797	0	a	Yeah .
42798	0	a	Yeah .
42799	0	a	Seven , eight , ei eight Euros .
42800	0	a	Exce except for the for the special shape , the surfing board , it has a quite a a conventional layout of buttons .
42801	0	a	Yeah .
42802	0	a	Yeah .
42803	0	a	Yeah .
42804	0	a	So
42805	0	a	this one model
42806	0	a	and
42807	0	a	yeah .
42808	0	a	Can I see ?
42809	0	a	Thanks .
42810	0	a	Sure .
42811	0	a	Okay
42812	0	a	I like the volume control , that is good .
42813	0	a	Th this is a magic one
42814	0	a	but I know we do not want to talk about that ,
42815	0	a	you know like
42816	0	a	i i i
42817	0	a	it is a very futuristic , it is like it is like a brain machine interface and all this stuff we are thinking about in the future , it can come .
42818	0	a	Uh huh .
42819	0	a	Yeah .
42820	0	a	So it does not actually have buttons .
42821	0	a	So that then what we look t
42822	0	a	yeah .
42823	0	a	Did you want to see ?
42824	0	a	Yeah no
42825	1	a	you can carry on ,
42826	0	a	I just look how it feels all .
42827	0	a	This is a model ,
42828	0	a	yeah .
42829	0	a	Yes it really feels like like like a mobile phone .
42830	0	a	Yeah .
42831	0	a	Yep .
42832	0	a	Just I am
42833	0	a	I really want to talk to it .
42834	0	a	Yeah actually , yeah .
42835	0	a	But .
42836	0	a	It wo not talk back .
42837	0	a	So
42838	1	a	but but continue with your
42839	0	a	so well
42840	0	a	then the this is the a more a little smooth and it gives a lot of functionality , in this way ,
42841	0	a	so all we have
42842	0	a	th you see there are only six keys ,
42843	1	a	but do not worry
42844	0	a	they are ma they are doing the job of twelve keys actually here .
42845	0	a	Right .
42846	0	a	And so they have more space actually
42847	0	a	and it is easy to use this
42848	0	a	and you have
42849	0	a	so
42850	0	a	this is a standard infrared eye , and then you have a power button , which l volume , what you have , and then other than that you have channel up and down and f slow pause or s slow lo
42851	0	a	yeah s pause or stop ,
42852	0	a	and then you can
42853	0	a	you have a LCD display , here and
42854	0	a	y this is a functional thing
42855	0	a	which can change
42856	0	a	like
42857	0	a	it is a toggle switch which could change the function
42858	0	a	say , y you press it
42859	0	a	Yeah .
42860	0	a	Play , pause .
42861	0	a	From DVD player to television or something .
42862	0	a	Exactly yeah .
42863	0	a	I really can change it ,
42864	0	a	so
42865	0	a	Instead of having many switches , y
42866	0	a	The LCD can display what is that on that ,
42867	0	a	and well
42868	0	a	you can have a integrated microphone over here ,
42869	0	a	or in the button th here ,
42870	0	a	so which can
42871	0	a	basically
42872	0	a	you want to do a speech recognition and that channel a lot of information can be di displayed here directly on the on your on your display .
42873	0	a	Yes .
42874	0	a	To audio and to video on demand .
42875	0	a	Yes
42876	0	a	and and and then you get feedback via the LCD
42877	0	a	yeah .
42878	0	a	Yes .
42879	0	a	This is the orange button , the microphone .
42880	0	a	An
42881	0	a	yeah .
42882	0	a	And here is a small LED which is like blinking one , which tells you like are you running out of the battery , and which is can be useful for the locating as I was talking earlier
42883	0	a	okay .
42884	0	a	Yeah .
42885	0	a	And well
42886	0	a	then we have a cover
42887	0	a	basically , basically
42888	0	a	you do not need much of the time this , when you need you can use it , and this gives additional functionality
42889	1	a	that tomorrow you want you can add a tactile thing to this cover
42890	0	a	you know .
42891	0	a	Yeah .
42892	0	a	Crazy dis designer ,
42893	0	a	okay .
42894	0	a	Design enter .
42895	0	a	Yeah
42896	0	a	but but
42897	0	a	but but i in there when this is closed , will it also cover up the LCD screen ?
42898	0	a	But but the LCD screen I mean is a very well an eye attracting feature
42899	1	a	which should not be should not be
42900	0	a	That th that is true .
42901	0	a	Yeah .
42902	0	a	Yeah
42903	0	a	yeah
42904	0	a	yeah
42905	0	a	yeah .
42906	0	a	Yeah .
42907	0	a	It is basically to do that .
42908	0	a	Yeah .
42909	0	a	Actually when you are watching the TV , when you are watching anything or listening to them , you hardly care about what is getting displayed here ,
42910	0	a	you know ,
42911	0	a	you want to
42912	0	a	and this gives a protection to the LCD actually , giving a cover to that actually .
42913	0	a	Oh actually well .
42914	0	a	Gives a protection because when it falls down or something it it is it is is is it gives a protec
42915	0	a	it is more robust that way .
42916	0	a	Yes .
42917	0	a	Yes ,
42918	0	a	more robust .
42919	0	a	Yes okay .
42920	0	a	yeah .
42921	0	a	And you have very good chances
42922	0	a	Yeah .
42923	0	a	It is low weight .
42924	0	a	You have to see
42925	0	a	yeah
42926	0	a	yeah
42927	0	a	the the components we put inside is very low weight .
42928	0	a	Yeah .
42929	0	a	So the the cost is actually a bit more , it is it is
42930	0	a	it is sixteen Francs .
42931	0	a	It
42932	0	a	Sixteen Euros .
42933	0	a	Sixteen Euros
42934	0	a	sorry .
42935	0	a	Okay .
42936	0	a	So it is well outside the budget then .
42937	0	a	Then it is out of budget .
42938	0	a	But the the main point we we talk about that with our manufacturer .
42939	0	a	But w
42940	0	a	kay .
42941	0	a	And they say basically that the SR system would be something like three Francs per item
42942	0	a	so
42943	0	a	three Euros
42944	0	a	sorry .
42945	0	a	Yeah .
42946	0	a	Three Euros .
42947	0	a	And
42948	0	a	No no no , part of that ,
42949	0	a	yeah .
42950	0	a	That is on top of the sixteen , or is it part of that ?
42951	0	a	So that takes it down to thirteen Euros without the speech recognition .
42952	0	a	Part of that .
42953	0	a	Yeah ,
42954	0	a	yeah .
42955	0	a	Yeah .
42956	0	a	Well
42957	0	a	if you we can have
42958	1	a	if you have new more ideas we can add
42959	1	a	new more some more keys
42960	0	a	if you want to
42961	0	a	you know
42962	0	a	Yeah
42963	1	a	it it should not be cluttering up everything .
42964	0	a	Well
42965	0	a	I think th th
42966	0	a	yeah
42967	1	a	we should stick with a number of keys
42968	0	a	because if we add too much then it is too
42969	0	a	Locati .
42970	0	a	What is this one on the side ?
42971	0	a	okay .
42972	0	a	that is for the
42973	0	a	it is kind of a LED for indicating your battery and as well as it is like a blinking one
42974	0	a	you know
42975	0	a	you can keep it aside .
42976	0	a	Location .
42977	0	a	Yeah .
42978	0	a	kay .
42979	0	a	I like the shape of them , I do like the the size and the the shape .
42980	0	a	Yeah .
42981	0	a	Well well .
42982	1	a	Be before ta talking about the money and what is possible and what is not possible , maybe Anna you can give our give us your
42983	0	a	Yes .
42984	0	a	Okay .
42985	1	a	And maybe we run the evaluation on both of the products , both of these two .
42986	0	a	Evalua evaluation
42987	1	a	and also the evaluation criteria , so what what is important to look at .
42988	0	a	Okay .
42989	0	a	Basically this is what we have talked about already , , from the marketing point of view .
42990	0	a	We just want to make sure that we have taken into account
42991	0	a	Yep .
42992	0	a	Well
42993	1	a	just do it quickly
42994	0	a	if if we al already .
42995	0	a	So
42996	0	a	it is just a shortlist of criteria on the things that we have identified as being important to selling the product .
42997	0	a	we just go through these and rate them as a group and then at the end we will make an evaluation based on that , so just average the score of those items ,
42998	0	a	so
42999	0	a	These are the things we identified as being important .
43000	0	a	the three things were look and feel , innovation and ease of use , were the three important components appealing to the correct demographic so using those things in the right way to appeal to our demographic .
43001	0	a	And then goin following the company motto , following the fashion trends and putting that into the product as well .
43002	0	a	So well
43003	0	a	do you want to go through and put through those on the the two products now or do we want to discuss them further and then evaluate them ?
43004	0	a	Okay .
43005	0	a	, n no why not why not discuss discuss it now ,
43006	0	a	, well
43007	1	a	my my personal view is w when when this one is eight Euros we must think how can we improve it .
43008	0	a	So
43009	0	a	f
43010	1	a	just go through onto the whiteboard I guess .
43011	0	a	Not sure how this is going to come out .
43012	0	a	So
43013	0	a	the first one was really very far below budget ,
43014	0	a	would you want to take the price down of the end product according to that or just have the high profit on it ?
43015	0	a	Cause if we are only going to make it for eight Euros then we have a
43016	0	a	And then I mean w w w you must just see it
43017	1	a	we can still spend this four and a half Euro
43018	0	a	and to r
43019	0	a	because th th th the the selling price is already prite fik quite fixed on twenty five Euros
43020	1	a	so we just have to offer as much as as well value for the for the customer he can have for twenty five Euro .
43021	0	a	Yep .
43022	0	a	Functionality .
43023	0	a	Okay so
43024	0	a	look and feel , innovation
43025	0	a	And now it easy to use .
43026	0	a	Easy to use .
43027	0	a	target .
43028	0	a	And trends .
43029	0	a	Oh ,
43030	0	a	you following the idea of using the removable covers on these ?
43031	0	a	Is that part of both of them or ?
43032	0	a	Okay .
43033	0	a	well
43034	1	a	w w we can still discuss that .
43035	0	a	So ,
43036	0	a	and together with evaluating this we we might come with new ideas
43037	0	a	I mean adding things or removing of options because they are too expensive ,
43038	0	a	but
43039	0	a	I have received a framework which we can do this .
43040	0	a	I mean did you have this this Excel sheet ?
43041	0	a	No okay ,
43042	0	a	this is these are the the the latest prices of our production production unit for several components , so we can see whether the the price is is within the twelve Euro fifty cents .
43043	0	a	No .
43044	0	a	No .
43045	0	a	No .
43046	0	a	Okay .
43047	0	a	So
43048	1	a	maybe we can start with this , , calling this one .
43049	0	a	Okay .
43050	0	a	Yep .
43051	0	a	So
43052	0	a	it is the pink .
43053	0	a	Th th this is the first design .
43054	0	a	And the other one is green .
43055	0	a	Yes .
43056	0	a	Okay , so
43057	0	a	look and feel ?
43058	0	a	Where one is
43059	0	a	I have broken the pen again .
43060	0	a	there is another pen .
43061	0	a	S
43062	0	a	yeah .
43063	1	a	Get that one .
43064	0	a	w one is bad and seven is the best .
43065	0	a	Sorry ,
43066	0	a	one is true and seven is false .
43067	0	a	One is the best .
43068	0	a	Okay .
43069	0	a	So on a scale of one to seven ?
43070	0	a	Kay .
43071	0	a	Okay .
43072	0	a	So .
43073	0	a	Look and feel .
43074	0	a	Well
43075	0	a	you already feel that pretty much I think .
43076	0	a	In i in my opinion purely feel is is is very good , is very good in your hand , so
43077	0	a	I
43078	0	a	I
43079	0	a	I would consider two or or may maybe even one for feel .
43080	0	a	, yeah .
43081	0	a	But that is just half ,
43082	1	a	we should also consider look ,
43083	0	a	and then i it looks quite conventional .
43084	0	a	Do not you agree ?
43085	0	a	So
43086	0	a	maybe two .
43087	0	a	yeah .
43088	0	a	On the scale u it is between functional and fancy basically we are looking at ,
43089	0	a	so
43090	0	a	Ma ma ma ma maybe say say five
43091	0	a	I
43092	0	a	It is my opinion ,
43093	0	a	but I do not know what what
43094	0	a	Four , four .
43095	0	a	Well
43096	0	a	I will give it maybe we have anyways
43097	0	a	the way we have designed it is like the surf as you say
43098	0	a	you know .
43099	0	a	Yeah .
43100	0	a	It
43101	0	a	though the look is fine but still I will give four in that case
43102	0	a	you know .
43103	0	a	Yeah .
43104	0	a	Four maybe .
43105	0	a	Four ?
43106	0	a	Okay .
43107	0	a	Four yeah
43108	0	a	that
43109	0	a	Yeah .
43110	0	a	Now we th th
43111	1	a	then we settle on four .
43112	0	a	I will gi
43113	0	a	yeah .
43114	0	a	Kay .
43115	0	a	Can you maybe fix the other
43116	1	a	, try it , just try it .
43117	0	a	Yeah .
43118	1	a	If you press like this not like this
43119	0	a	then you
43120	0	a	But
43121	0	a	Okay .
43122	0	a	No
43123	0	a	that is the
43124	0	a	ink is dried .
43125	0	a	No .
43126	0	a	C can you get the batteries ?
43127	0	a	No no
43128	0	a	the battery has fallen down ,
43129	0	a	that is i
43130	0	a	Yeah .
43131	0	a	Battery is low ,
43132	0	a	is not it the ink ?
43133	0	a	The b
43134	0	a	that is the that that one ?
43135	0	a	battery there .
43136	0	a	No no it is not that ,
43137	0	a	it is how to close a battery .
43138	0	a	Okay ?
43139	0	a	Now it should be .
43140	0	a	No
43141	0	a	I think it is lost a battery .
43142	0	a	No
43143	0	a	it is
43144	0	a	It would still write but it would not pick it up with the sensors .
43145	0	a	Oh it will not
43146	0	a	ri
43147	0	a	Is there another battery there ?
43148	0	a	Oh yeah .
43149	0	a	You got a second ?
43150	0	a	Well
43151	0	a	we wo not be able to tell .
43152	1	a	Try a
43153	0	a	Perfect .
43154	0	a	Yes ,
43155	0	a	it it has a .
43156	0	a	Is that working ?
43157	0	a	Did it come out ?
43158	0	a	Good .
43159	0	a	Okay .
43160	0	a	Good .
43161	0	a	Good .
43162	0	a	Because we will be able to see it still even if it was not working , it is just a normal whiteboard marker but it would not be picked up on the the actual whiteboard .
43163	0	a	Yeah ,
43164	0	a	yeah .
43165	0	a	Yep .
43166	0	a	Okay .
43167	0	a	So
43168	0	a	then then
43169	0	a	And the other one ?
43170	0	a	I think it is slightly better , ,
43171	0	a	it is hard to tell from just the plasticine ,
43172	0	a	but
43173	0	a	Wow .
43174	0	a	I I
43175	0	a	I
43176	0	a	When we want to include I I
43177	0	a	I am doubting about this this component .
43178	0	a	It it it
43179	0	a	it breaks
43180	0	a	in your
43181	0	a	, yes I see , okay .
43182	0	a	Kay
43183	0	a	maybe
43184	0	a	It is not a button it is a led ,
43185	0	a	it is a
43186	0	a	Ac actually
43187	0	a	yeah
43188	0	a	it should be embedded .
43189	0	a	No
43190	0	a	actually this is this is not going to protrude actually ,
43191	0	a	it it is
43192	0	a	n
43193	0	a	i
43194	0	a	it is jus
43195	0	a	It is a led actually which which will be covering in a curve It is will be embedded there so it wo not be really you know protruding or something .
43196	0	a	Okay .
43197	0	a	Yeah .
43198	0	a	Yeah .
43199	0	a	Oh
43200	1	a	you can push push it again , you can push it .
43201	0	a	Yeah .
43202	0	a	The other thing is , is the left hand one protruding ?
43203	0	a	Cause if people are left handed they want to use the other hand ,
43204	0	a	maybe it wo not work so well .
43205	0	a	Yeah .
43206	0	a	Yeah .
43207	0	a	Yeah .
43208	0	a	No you it it not protruding actually , it will go in better into that
43209	0	a	it is fine I think .
43210	0	a	Okay .
43211	0	a	Well
43212	0	a	r r
43213	0	a	I would say two or three for that one , personally .
43214	0	a	Probably more towards three than two .
43215	0	a	I think the look is better but the feel is is is worse .
43216	0	a	So so I would also say this is four .
43217	0	a	Okay .
43218	0	a	But w w do you what do you think ?
43219	0	a	My just that the feel is that you
43220	0	a	right now you you do not see the feel because right for example if you press it quite inside now like this
43221	0	a	, now it is embedded one .
43222	0	a	Yeah .
43223	0	a	Yes .
43224	0	a	This is how embedded one will
43225	0	a	Yeah .
43226	0	a	Yes ,
43227	0	a	it basically is the same shape .
43228	0	a	It is a bas basically the same thing actually .
43229	0	a	You will be Except that in this c
43230	0	a	Yeah
43231	0	a	And the LCD makes it better .
43232	0	a	Yeah .
43233	1	a	And you might have a slight thing for to forward and
43234	0	a	Yeah ,
43235	0	a	yeah .
43236	0	a	Yeah .
43237	0	a	Yeah .
43238	0	a	, okay .
43239	0	a	Yeah .
43240	0	a	So I will say two .
43241	0	a	Yeah
43242	0	a	it is d it is definitely more fancier than that one .
43243	0	a	Yes , okay .
43244	0	a	I would say two , three .
43245	0	a	Okay .
43246	0	a	Yeah .
43247	0	a	So ,
43248	0	a	consensus ?
43249	0	a	Two or three ?
43250	0	a	Two ?
43251	0	a	, kay .
43252	0	a	Two ? .
43253	0	a	Yep .
43254	0	a	Two is good
43255	0	a	yes .
43256	0	a	looking like
43257	0	a	No
43258	0	a	but except for the design of the surf .
43259	0	a	Innovation .
43260	0	a	The first one , not really muc
43261	0	a	Basically there is no innovation in the first one compared to what exists in the market ,
43262	0	a	right ?
43263	0	a	Yeah .
43264	0	a	Yeah .
43265	0	a	Do we
43266	0	a	The surf design .
43267	0	a	What What features are we actually including ?
43268	0	a	Are we including like a location kind of thing like trying to find it ?
43269	0	a	There is nothing like that ?
43270	0	a	But th is there any there is no actual innovation in that at all , it is just a straight out remote control .
43271	0	a	You should be rea
43272	0	a	no I think it is more of the feel .
43273	0	a	Yeah ,
43274	0	a	yeah .
43275	0	a	Yeah .
43276	0	a	Yeah .
43277	0	a	Okay .
43278	0	a	The only innova innovation is the shape .
43279	0	a	Yeah .
43280	1	a	Say about that .
43281	0	a	Okay .
43282	0	a	S
43283	0	a	so that
43284	0	a	So
43285	0	a	there is no
43286	0	a	this look and feel thing , though that is not a technological innovation .
43287	0	a	Yeah .
43288	0	a	Yeah .
43289	0	a	You are right .
43290	0	a	So I would be up for seven for innovation .
43291	0	a	Yeah .
43292	0	a	And the And the second one is really state of the art , in terms of innovation .
43293	0	a	Yep .
43294	0	a	And with many more functionalities , and can open and close the the bottom part .
43295	0	a	Yeah ,
43296	0	a	it gives it
43297	0	a	Yep .
43298	0	a	Yes .
43299	0	a	A and the LCD screen is That is that is that is well it is quite innovative .
43300	0	a	Yeah .
43301	0	a	And all the scrolling buttons and menu and pro programmable device behind this .
43302	0	a	could put it at one or two I would say .
43303	0	a	Okay .
43304	0	a	Yeah .
43305	0	a	Personally .
43306	0	a	So what is it , what are the innovations with this ?
43307	0	a	Got the LCD screen .
43308	0	a	Yeah
43309	0	a	automatic speech recognition .
43310	0	a	Is that in this one though ?
43311	0	a	Is this cause this is the
43312	0	a	Th th there were different options we discussed then , we discussed the one that was in budget and the one that was out of budget .
43313	0	a	No ,
43314	0	a	we ha
43315	0	a	Yeah , eight Euros
43316	0	a	yeah .
43317	0	a	We just diske discuss it as you designed it
43318	0	a	and then we will will try to get it in the budget .
43319	0	a	Okay .
43320	0	a	Yeah .
43321	0	a	So the cost for these were
43322	0	a	what was the cost for the first one ?
43323	0	a	Eight Euros ?
43324	0	a	And this one was sixteen Euros .
43325	0	a	So
43326	0	a	Eight .
43327	0	a	Eight .
43328	0	a	Well
43329	1	a	actually we have yeah to check again
43330	1	a	yeah .
43331	0	a	Yes .
43332	0	a	Sixteen .
43333	0	a	Sixteen Euros .
43334	0	a	Okay .
43335	0	a	So .
43336	0	a	Innovation for this one is two ?
43337	0	a	One ?
43338	0	a	Two ?
43339	0	a	It is a two , I would say two .
43340	1	a	W W un to be one what would do we nee actually ,
43341	0	a	yeah ,
43342	0	a	I do not see
43343	0	a	okay ,
43344	1	a	one would would be without buttons , .
43345	0	a	Two .
43346	0	a	Why it is one .
43347	0	a	A man w w
43348	0	a	Yes .
43349	0	a	Yeah .
43350	0	a	Well
43351	0	a	the speech recognition is a very good innovation I believe it ,
43352	0	a	so
43353	0	a	Give it a one ?
43354	0	a	Yep .
43355	0	a	Bu
43356	0	a	Yeah .
43357	1	a	So maybe we can put one .
43358	0	a	This this is it w with the speech recognition ?
43359	0	a	Well .
43360	0	a	It is using speech recognition , yeah .
43361	0	a	Okay yeah .
43362	0	a	Gi given that that it works ,
43363	0	a	then it is I think one .
43364	0	a	Yeah , one ,
43365	0	a	yeah .
43366	0	a	Okay .
43367	0	a	Ease of use ?
43368	0	a	He is used to it act
43369	0	a	They are used to it actually .
43370	0	a	So
43371	0	a	the first one is really standard , so
43372	0	a	everybody
43373	0	a	i including our grandmothers can use it ,
43374	0	a	right ?
43375	0	a	Yeah .
43376	0	a	Yeah .
43377	0	a	Yep .
43378	0	a	So that is maybe a a two for ease of use .
43379	0	a	Here there may
43380	0	a	, though it has more functionality
43381	0	a	I think it should not be for the user to learn it actually .
43382	0	a	, the other one is quite easy , tho though .
43383	0	a	Okay .
43384	0	a	It should not be diffi
43385	0	a	yeah ,
43386	0	a	actually in fact I think it will be
43387	0	a	Yeah
43388	0	a	Yeah
43389	0	a	but y
43390	0	a	Well
43391	0	a	we have reduced the keys actually you see .
43392	0	a	So maybe a three or a four .
43393	0	a	One me we hope
43394	0	a	maybe sometimes people get scared with the number of buttons .
43395	0	a	And there is a
43396	0	a	like
43397	0	a	I would say three .
43398	0	a	Or maybe four .
43399	0	a	Okay .
43400	0	a	Consensus ?
43401	0	a	Three or four ?
43402	0	a	Three ?
43403	0	a	Okay .
43404	0	a	Three , I would .
43405	0	a	Three is fine with me .
43406	0	a	Yeah , yeah
43407	0	a	because it is n it is not like a big one with one hundred buttons or so , This one would be for grandmothers .
43408	0	a	Three .
43409	0	a	Yeah
43410	0	a	it is a
43411	0	a	actually the user has to put some effort to do use that actually ,
43412	0	a	it is not so easy , like this one the normal .
43413	0	a	No .
43414	0	a	Yeah .
43415	0	a	Yes but then when when he is used to it , i i it is quite easy .
43416	0	a	Is quite easy yeah .
43417	0	a	So so I think th three is good .
43418	0	a	Initially there there is a lot of effort , yeah .
43419	0	a	Yeah .
43420	0	a	Okay .
43421	0	a	Good .
43422	0	a	What is the next ?
43423	0	a	So
43424	0	a	Twe twenty to forty , yes that is
43425	0	a	So
43426	0	a	three is
43427	0	a	how well it goes to the target demographic .
43428	0	a	So
43429	0	a	we are d we are still thinking twenty to forty year olds ?
43430	0	a	That is
43431	0	a	Oh
43432	0	a	no ,
43433	0	a	this would I
43434	0	a	I would I would give this model to the old people actually .
43435	0	a	No .
43436	0	a	Yeah , grandmothers ,
43437	0	a	yeah .
43438	0	a	Yeah .
43439	0	a	So sh completely changed our demographic there , it is not part of the the funky young thing .
43440	0	a	And
43441	0	a	Oh
43442	0	a	yeah , .
43443	0	a	Well
43444	0	a	exce except for the surfing shape .
43445	0	a	Yeah that is true .
43446	0	a	I mean that is that is something which which has an appeal on this group I think ,
43447	0	a	but
43448	1	a	w w w we after this we can can consider for instance , making this more attractive to to the demographic
43449	0	a	Yeah .
43450	0	a	Yeah .
43451	0	a	If it was the very bottom price range or it was like between this and another one we did the same thing then
43452	0	a	I can imagine it being applying to the the demographic
43453	0	a	yeah .
43454	0	a	Yeah .
43455	0	a	That is it is still
43456	0	a	Cause we have got room , we have got some budget there to add a few things to it ,
43457	0	a	that is right .
43458	0	a	But as it is now , I w would say , six , something .
43459	0	a	Yeah .
43460	0	a	Do you agree ?
43461	0	a	, yeah , indeed .
43462	0	a	And
43463	0	a	I
43464	0	a	Well
43465	0	a	I think
43466	0	a	Yeah .
43467	0	a	Yeah
43468	0	a	because it is so important it is i it was written that it really so important , the the the look and taking care of its it targets , the right range of people ,
43469	0	a	right ?
43470	0	a	Yeah .
43471	0	a	yeah
43472	0	a	but but if you sell it in the market it is going to be cheap , actually .
43473	0	a	But w
43474	0	a	Yeah .
43475	0	a	But it is going to be cheap
43476	0	a	whatever though ,
43477	0	a	it was set with i
43478	0	a	we have got a set price .
43479	0	a	So
43480	0	a	And people can still decide to use the cheaper one
43481	0	a	instead of a
43482	0	a	Okay .
43483	0	a	But for us it is
43484	0	a	yeah
43485	0	a	we have a constraint that we need to sell at twenty five Euros .
43486	0	a	Yeah .
43487	0	a	There is nothing that would make me spend an extra k few Euros on that one rather than another one .
43488	0	a	Ju just think , twenty five Euros , I mean it is not going to be cheaper .
43489	0	a	Yeah .
43490	0	a	Okay .
43491	0	a	So in that case well it is fine then .
43492	0	a	Yeah .
43493	0	a	We can
43494	0	a	yeah .
43495	0	a	Okay .
43496	0	a	Okay .
43497	0	a	and the demokraphi demographic of the second one ?
43498	0	a	It is got the got the the toys in it , it is got the LCD screen
43499	0	a	and
43500	0	a	And the demographics of
43501	0	a	Yeah
43502	0	a	I think it is it has more market actually .
43503	0	a	Yeah
43504	0	a	tha tha tha tha
43505	0	a	tha that is
43506	0	a	I think it is better ,
43507	0	a	because of the LCD screen
43508	0	a	which is really an appeal on the on the on the on the and on the
43509	0	a	Yeah .
43510	0	a	Yeah .
43511	0	a	And if you want to target
43512	0	a	yeah
43513	1	a	if we we wish to to sell four millions of this , I think for this audience we need absolutely the LCD screen .
43514	0	a	So ,
43515	0	a	the LCD screen attracts ,
43516	0	a	yes .
43517	0	a	Yeah .
43518	0	a	Because it
43519	0	a	, ma maybe that is something to consider , yes ,
43520	0	a	so .
43521	1	a	I think especially if we are going to n have an LCD screen on a low range product then that is good .
43522	0	a	Yeah .
43523	0	a	Okay .
43524	0	a	Wh
43525	0	a	what what
43526	0	a	No
43527	0	a	s say t two .
43528	0	a	I would probably go with three again for that one .
43529	0	a	Or even Even one and two .
43530	0	a	Y
43531	0	a	yeah ,
43532	0	a	you know
43533	0	a	two .
43534	0	a	Or two .
43535	0	a	Okay .
43536	0	a	So , two
43537	0	a	, yeah ?
43538	0	a	Two ?
43539	0	a	Okay ,
43540	0	a	the final point , trends .
43541	0	a	Yeah .
43542	0	a	Two yeah .
43543	0	a	Yeah two yeah .
43544	0	a	Because tomorrow this will be more appealing
43545	0	a	because you can add lot of sophistication on that .
43546	0	a	Because then you you have it
43547	0	a	d you have lot of things which you can include
43548	0	a	for the people to
43549	1	a	We have to practically test it .
43550	0	a	Yeah .
43551	0	a	Yep .
43552	0	a	And especially I guess cause this has the speech recognition as well ,
43553	0	a	and that makes it more appealing , it is more of a a new fun toy .
43554	0	a	The field test will tell you how good .
43555	0	a	Yeah .
43556	0	a	Okay .
43557	0	a	And following the trends .
43558	0	a	The trends .
43559	0	a	So
43560	0	a	the trends were the fruit and vegetables and the spongy feel .
43561	0	a	So
43562	0	a	as it is , not really doing either of them .
43563	0	a	I think
43564	0	a	Spongy , , that means that it goes in in the water .
43565	0	a	Well ,
43566	1	a	the spongy could be part of the the feel of the buttons as well ,
43567	0	a	I know some
43568	0	a	have you tried the mobile phones that have got the kind of spongy buttons
43569	0	a	and
43570	0	a	not not exactly spongy
43571	0	a	but I am thinking one of the Nokias that is got like you
43572	0	a	ca it has not got individual buttons
43573	0	a	it is got just a one bit on it
43574	0	a	and so you can
43575	0	a	that feels kind of spongy .
43576	0	a	okay .
43577	0	a	Yeah I know .
43578	0	a	But this one includes this feature , right ?
43579	0	a	Spongy buttons .
43580	0	a	Yeah .
43581	0	a	We we
43582	0	a	we
43583	0	a	we
43584	0	a	we
43585	0	a	yeah ,
43586	0	a	it is the way they are going to be , actually .
43587	0	a	So it is sort of , yeah .
43588	0	a	So
43589	1	a	the maybe in the colour we can make it fruit and and veggie .
43590	0	a	Okay .
43591	0	a	But that is if you are using the covers .
43592	0	a	And the then we can al
43593	0	a	yes .
43594	0	a	Yeah .
43595	0	a	Or is it just one
43596	0	a	Well
43597	0	a	they make it for mobiles , it ca not be that much more complicated .
43598	0	a	We can we can consider
43599	0	a	is it possible do you think , to to make a cover for s such a phone ?
43600	0	a	I mean
43601	0	a	Well
43602	0	a	just with the with the flexible plastic
43603	0	a	I th
43604	0	a	I th
43605	0	a	I think
43606	1	a	O o or just two things which can be put on each other .
43607	0	a	But why do you want to cover that actually ?
43608	0	a	In that w in the mod
43609	0	a	y are you sure ?
43610	0	a	Yeah I think
43611	0	a	yeah
43612	0	a	it should be possible like what we do with the mobile phone ,
43613	0	a	yeah .
43614	0	a	So you got the option of having different colours or different textures .
43615	0	a	Yeah .
43616	0	a	This is possible .
43617	0	a	Yeah
43618	0	a	exactly like Nokia phones .
43619	0	a	Yes , exactly like it .
43620	0	a	Yep .
43621	0	a	, so
43622	0	a	Maybe we can
43623	1	a	but we have to decide it , we can put the the the fancy f look of vegetables for instance , to to these covers and s now try to invest in the in in the features .
43624	0	a	I think the if we do the cover that is really going with the company is philosophy of having the fashion in in electronics , it lets people have the latest fashion even next year when fruit and vegetables might be out , you will still be able to put a new cover on it
43625	0	a	and then it will still be in fashion .
43626	0	a	Yeah .
43627	0	a	Cause sometimes
43628	0	a	look at this computer , th this laptop , it is all black , and it is quite conventional , and sometimes people do not like too much flashy colours like this one presented here .
43629	1	a	So maybe we could do like in the range the set of what we propose a black one , very standard one , that meets the the requirements of th such people that want really standard things .
43630	0	a	Yep .
43631	0	a	Yep .
43632	1	a	And then you have the option of having the different colours , different covers .
43633	0	a	Yes .
43634	0	a	So so so that that would make the trends equal ,
43635	0	a	so we we we really have do not have ,
43636	0	a	I mean
43637	0	a	Yeah .
43638	0	a	There is n
43639	0	a	yeah .
43640	0	a	Cause that is the that is the feature that could be included in either of them .
43641	0	a	Although it is more with the spongy buttons on the on the other one .
43642	0	a	Yeah , so a a point better for the for the number two .
43643	0	a	Yes , indeed .
43644	0	a	Okay .
43645	0	a	So .
43646	0	a	Two and three , or one and two ?
43647	0	a	Yes .
43648	0	a	Yeah , it is one .
43649	0	a	Say , say one and two .
43650	0	a	One and two .
43651	0	a	Okay .
43652	0	a	So
43653	1	a	le le let is see .
43654	0	a	So
43655	0	a	d
43656	0	a	this one has spongy but buttons ?
43657	0	a	, I see ,
43658	0	a	yes okay .
43659	0	a	Okay .
43660	0	a	Yeah ,
43661	0	a	it says a
43662	0	a	One point six ,
43663	0	a	one point
43664	0	a	One point eight yeah .
43665	0	a	Yeah , the blue one spongy .
43666	0	a	Okay so
43667	0	a	the average of that is three six nine divided by five , so five nine by five , one point s eight ?
43668	0	a	This one , eleven thirteen nineteen twenty one , divided by five is four point two
43669	0	a	yep .
43670	0	a	Good .
43671	1	a	Just add it .
43672	0	a	Nine .
43673	0	a	You know .
43674	0	a	Three , six , seven .
43675	0	a	Four point four point two .
43676	0	a	Very good .
43677	0	a	Okay .
43678	0	a	But we still got a very different price for those two so they are not really comparable yet anyway .
43679	1	a	We we must try to get them closer .
43680	0	a	Yeah , it is right ,
43681	0	a	yeah
43682	0	a	that is right .
43683	0	a	Yep .
43684	0	a	Both in i i
43685	1	a	or we just have to choose .
43686	0	a	Wow .
43687	1	a	And adapt .
43688	1	a	Because , when we choose for this one we have to we have to make it more attractive and w when we to d for this one we have to make it more cheap .
43689	0	a	Yep .
43690	0	a	Well
43691	1	a	it is easier to just make that one cheaper by just taking the speech recognition out .
43692	0	a	That will basically take us down to the budget .
43693	0	a	Yes , well
43694	0	a	But I am
43695	0	a	now
43696	0	a	did y did you work with the same prices that I have here ?
43697	0	a	So
43698	0	a	I
43699	0	a	I give
43700	0	a	yeah
43701	0	a	I just give a call with the manufacturer and I explained them and
43702	0	a	they told me this could be possible for sixteen Fr Euros .
43703	0	a	unfortunately we did not see this chip , Matthew ,
43704	1	a	so maybe we have to recap with this one .
43705	0	a	Yeah .
43706	0	a	Yep .
43707	0	a	tha
43708	0	a	Well yes , well
43709	0	a	re reconsider it .
43710	0	a	Maybe we ought to reconsider everything with this , yeah .
43711	0	a	So
43712	1	a	let is let is try to to model this this phone in this sheet ,
43713	0	a	what kind of energy source
43714	0	a	I I
43715	0	a	we did not speak about that .
43716	0	a	It is a it is a normal battery , or
43717	0	a	Yes .
43718	0	a	Yeah ,
43719	0	a	it migh
43720	0	a	It
43721	0	a	it will need more than a conventional one ,
43722	0	a	it wo not be just
43723	0	a	maybe you might use a AA battery actually .
43724	0	a	What do you say , Mael ?
43725	0	a	Yeah .
43726	0	a	For this one it is a normal battery .
43727	0	a	Just so one battery .
43728	0	a	Kay .
43729	0	a	Electronics .
43730	1	a	given speech recognition I think w you should go for the less fancy chip .
43731	0	a	sample speaker , yeah .
43732	0	a	Yeah , yes ,
43733	0	a	or sample sensor , yes .
43734	0	a	Sample , yeah , this one .
43735	0	a	Yes , this one .
43736	0	a	Okay .
43737	0	a	Case ?
43738	0	a	I see I
43739	0	a	Double curve .
43740	0	a	So So
43741	0	a	which one are we talking to ?
43742	0	a	Well
43743	0	a	Yeah .
43744	0	a	Curved .
43745	0	a	Double curved
43746	0	a	yeah right .
43747	0	a	It is
43748	0	a	Are you talking about this or that ?
43749	0	a	Yeah , it is going to be more than just the biggest case , definitely .
43750	0	a	Either of them .
43751	0	a	Oh
43752	0	a	yes , we are talking about ,
43753	0	a	but they have the same shape ,
43754	0	a	but , actually bu
43755	0	a	So
43756	0	a	th th this would be double curves ?
43757	0	a	Kay .
43758	0	a	They are both going to be not basic cases .
43759	0	a	Yeah .
43760	0	a	, plastic would be the material .
43761	0	a	Yeah .
43762	0	a	The basic one , yep .
43763	0	a	Is it zero Franc ?
43764	0	a	LCD is .
43765	0	a	A special colour ?
43766	0	a	good .
43767	0	a	special colour , now we leave it to the covers .
43768	0	a	So
43769	0	a	now we are either going button or LCDs , LCD display .
43770	0	a	Push .
43771	0	a	, yes ,
43772	0	a	but
43773	0	a	Yeah
43774	0	a	th
43775	0	a	now this is per per unit , this number of components .
43776	1	a	It is okay .
43777	1	a	Just say LCD .
43778	0	a	Is that price per unit , or for the whole thing ?
43779	0	a	So it would need twelve buttons .
43780	0	a	Yeah ,
43781	0	a	we might need a scroll wheel , right , for that ?
43782	0	a	No , for that one also .
43783	0	a	No but for this one it is twelve Euro .
43784	0	a	There are twelve ?
43785	1	a	Wait a minute ,
43786	0	a	it is not it is not double curved ,
43787	0	a	it is single curved ,
43788	0	a	right ?
43789	0	a	Because it is there is no like .
43790	0	a	So ,
43791	0	a	one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight , nine ,
43792	0	a	t
43793	0	a	Yes .
43794	0	a	Yeah
43795	0	a	that is a scroll .
43796	0	a	Twelve I believe .
43797	0	a	So this comes to eighteen .
43798	0	a	And that is without any special button supplements .
43799	0	a	Yeah ,
43800	1	a	one scroll wheel you might need .
43801	0	a	So So
43802	0	a	I think but th
43803	0	a	do you agree th that thi
43804	0	a	Yes
43805	0	a	I
43806	0	a	Yes
43807	0	a	I am I am no
43808	0	a	I am no
43809	0	a	I am not sh sure .
43810	0	a	So
43811	0	a	we would have a special colour , special form and special material on all of them .
43812	0	a	They are not just standard buttons .
43813	0	a	Bad estimate ,
43814	0	a	right ?
43815	0	a	That is the sample sensor and sample speaker .
43816	0	a	But I thought it would be curved on two
43817	0	a	it is like it is curved on the sides and curved on the top and bottom as well
43818	0	a	, that is what I thought .
43819	0	a	Well
43820	0	a	it is
43821	0	a	you know
43822	0	a	this curve like this so , it is w there is only is is
43823	0	a	is there is nothing like y you know in the other stuff there
43824	0	a	are
43825	0	a	yeah concave .
43826	0	a	Yes I kno undes
43827	0	a	I understand what you mean , yes .
43828	0	a	You talking about concave curves ?
43829	0	a	You think a single curved ?
43830	0	a	Uh huh .
43831	0	a	So I think we can put
43832	0	a	the single curved in the sixteen .
43833	0	a	Both .
43834	0	a	That makes seventeen .
43835	0	a	And what are just
43836	0	a	The bt buttons , we have twelve buttons , are you sure ?
43837	0	a	Yeah .
43838	0	a	Yes .
43839	0	a	W d
43840	0	a	we have we have not talk about a , but that is no a is very exp inexpensive
43841	0	a	I believe
43842	0	a	but it is not in the list .
43843	0	a	We have more , we have got those the scroll wheel on the side
43844	0	a	and yeah
43845	0	a	The sc
43846	0	a	So
43847	0	a	I had a bad bad estimation .
43848	0	a	We have got a scroll wheel for the volume
43849	0	a	do not we ,
43850	0	a	or is it some other thing that is not on there .
43851	0	a	W ho h
43852	0	a	is this a scroll wheel or is this a a a sort of button which can be pressed on two sides so for higher and lower ?
43853	0	a	No no no .
43854	0	a	Kay
43855	0	a	we have only got five minutes left guys
43856	1	a	so we need to wrap it up pretty fast .
43857	0	a	Yes , a kind of scroll wheel .
43858	0	a	So
43859	0	a	this is even more than the than the cost you gave , the sixteen Euros .
43860	0	a	Okay ,
43861	0	a	so based on that ,
43862	0	a	yeah ,
43863	0	a	where is the es okay sample speaker
43864	0	a	But still , yeah
43865	0	a	it
43866	0	a	No we cannot ,
43867	0	a	yeah .
43868	0	a	So
43869	0	a	We are
43870	1	a	We We could go for the for the for the for the for a simple chip ,
43871	0	a	but then we ca not have the the speech recognition ,
43872	0	a	yes ?
43873	0	a	Yes ?
43874	0	a	So so
43875	0	a	w when we w a
43876	0	a	this would this would be cutting the speech recognition .
43877	0	a	We just need that actually .
43878	0	a	We need one .
43879	0	a	So But the
43880	0	a	Yeah
43881	0	a	but if you have the near the LCD you can choose select between you know like uni universal between audio , TV and VCR , and this needs a needs a advanced chip .
43882	0	a	S
43883	0	a	Oh
43884	0	a	I i it
43885	0	a	I think it is going to be y
43886	0	a	y
43887	0	a	yeah it is th with the regular chip , yeah .
43888	0	a	Transti
43889	1	a	Say say it is regular , regular chip ,
43890	0	a	and we still on fifteen ,
43891	0	a	so
43892	0	a	Yes but that maybe
43893	0	a	Well
43894	0	a	we can just say one .
43895	0	a	Right , Matthew ?
43896	0	a	Or regular chip ?
43897	0	a	I think
43898	0	a	yeah
43899	0	a	regular , today we you can do that with regular chip .
43900	0	a	Yeah .
43901	0	a	Okay .
43902	0	a	Okay .
43903	0	a	Yeah .
43904	0	a	So .
43905	0	a	And what about the number of buttons buttons my Matthew ?
43906	0	a	When you look at this w , this u item , But
43907	0	a	You cannot make a phone to your boss saying twelve fifty is really really low ,
43908	0	a	no ?
43909	0	a	And we do not want to to change that
43910	0	a	right ?
43911	0	a	We we really want a LCD other otherwise we w wouldn not get the market .
43912	0	a	Yeah .
43913	0	a	Ca l we are just
43914	0	a	when we just want to to cut the number of buttons we have to make seven to to fit in in twelve twelve fifty .
43915	0	a	So is it possible ?
43916	0	a	But that is seven basic buttons right , seven buttons without any adds on , without special colours or form or material .
43917	0	a	That will be
43918	0	a	then we have have to ask the user to press it several times .
43919	0	a	No no ,
43920	0	a	he he
43921	0	a	he
43922	0	a	I
43923	0	a	I
43924	0	a	Well
43925	0	a	So
43926	0	a	the LCD display is is three Francs , sorry three Euros , by itself .
43927	1	a	Or we could even replace them by buttons actually .
43928	0	a	Otherwise y you ha you have a s ve very normal thing like this .
43929	0	a	It is evident .
43930	0	a	Yeah .
43931	0	a	So
43932	0	a	twelve Euro fifty , we got two off of the battery , we ca not do anything about that ,
43933	0	a	so ten fifty ,
43934	0	a	if we want an LCD dispra display , that is seven fifty , so we have got seven fifty to use for the case and for the buttons .
43935	0	a	And I dunno
43936	1	a	So wha what what each of us think about the because it is measure point the LCD ,
43937	0	a	Do you think it is important ?
43938	0	a	Because sometimes whe when you watch the TV in fact , you have a big display
43939	0	a	and maybe you do not need one more in your hands ?
43940	0	a	I dunno ,
43941	0	a	I am just asking .
43942	0	a	And the chip .
43943	0	a	Sorry
43944	0	a	the chip is up there already .
43945	1	a	So we are going to have to scale this down to get within budget ,
43946	0	a	there is no doubt about that .
43947	0	a	A .
43948	0	a	A actually it depends , it depends what kind of functionalities you want to add into it , for example if you add two more functionalities then better you add two more buttons , or and you will have LCD display which is that is going to bring the cost by two two Euros at least .
43949	0	a	Yep .
43950	0	a	Yeah .
43951	1	a	I think , unless we can really drive these prices down we need to get rid of the LCD display .
43952	0	a	Okay so we can get rid of it
43953	1	a	and then add a couple of buttons .
43954	0	a	Yeah , it is true yeah .
43955	0	a	But , do we want that ?
43956	0	a	On the market point of view , yeah .
43957	0	a	What do you think , LCD is a major feature , or ?
43958	0	a	You assume , you want a democratic voyt vote ,
43959	0	a	right ?
43960	0	a	Okay .
43961	0	a	I
43962	1	a	I think we have to come to a decision now , just I
43963	1	a	I think we we what we just do i is vote about the the LCD display
43964	0	a	so
43965	0	a	Yes .
43966	0	a	For the price ,
43967	0	a	it is going to be what we can afford , and it is looking like we ca not afford the LCD display , there is no way we can get it in there .
43968	0	a	Yes .
43969	0	a	Yes .
43970	0	a	Okay .
43971	0	a	One man one vote .
43972	0	a	S so who thinks the the LCD disply display should be i should be in it ?
43973	0	a	I th I would like t it to be in
43974	0	a	but I ca not see it happening .
43975	0	a	I ca not see it fitting in .
43976	0	a	I think but
43977	0	a	Yeah
43978	1	a	but the only thing is that what is the multiple functionalities you want to include with that .
43979	0	a	We need to be .
43980	0	a	Bu y you are a power voter veto anyway as Project Manager .
43981	0	a	, I know ,
43982	0	a	but
43983	0	a	Yes .
43984	0	a	Yeah .
43985	0	a	well
43986	1	a	we have to make a decision now , that is it .
43987	0	a	Yeah .
43988	0	a	So
43989	0	a	having an LCD s display is just have very very limited amount of buttons .
43990	0	a	Is that acceptable ?
43991	0	a	Ca can I have can the functions be implement in an
43992	0	a	You have you you agree .
43993	0	a	Yes .
43994	0	a	W
43995	0	a	I
43996	0	a	I
43997	0	a	I just
43998	0	a	Yeah .
43999	0	a	So hav hav having seven buttons , instead of twelve .
44000	0	a	So that wou would be cutting cutting suh say about these buttons .
44001	0	a	Because one
44002	0	a	yeah
44003	0	a	th
44004	1	a	show me that actually we could in fact we move these three buttons and have three possibilities for each of the three here .
44005	1	a	Here one , at the middle , and at the bottom .
44006	0	a	I think then we we are really losing ease of use .
44007	0	a	Okay , .
44008	0	a	That will create another problem .
44009	0	a	For the people to use it .
44010	0	a	It is not going to be easy .
44011	0	a	Okay .
44012	0	a	Okay .
44013	0	a	Doing that .
44014	0	a	So
44015	1	a	I I think we should we should cut the LCD screen .
44016	1	a	That that is that is my opinion .
44017	0	a	No ,
44018	0	a	it is okay , you cut the LCD screen
44019	1	a	and introduce two more buttons .
44020	0	a	Just where , LC
44021	0	a	Okay
44022	0	a	w we now we can just
44023	0	a	Yes .
44024	0	a	Okay .
44025	0	a	So
44026	0	a	LCD is out ,
44027	0	a	is speech rec out now ?
44028	0	a	We have
44029	0	a	Yep .
44030	0	a	The speech recognition is out .
44031	0	a	Because of the budget , yeah .
44032	0	a	Yep .
44033	0	a	So
44034	0	a	are we basically back to the original one now , back to the first version ?
44035	0	a	Which turns out to be on budget exactly , pretty much .
44036	0	a	Yeah .
44037	0	a	With these new costings .
44038	0	a	Yes .
44039	0	a	So
44040	0	a	just look at
44041	0	a	forget that one and look at that one now .
44042	0	a	Yeah .
44043	0	a	Yes .
44044	0	a	I th
44045	0	a	I th
44046	0	a	I think w we just go for this one
44047	0	a	and that that now twelve Euros is the is is the price ,
44048	0	a	okay .
44049	0	a	Yep .
44050	0	a	Okay .
44051	0	a	My m my supervisor will be glad that it is fifty cents cheaper than he expected .
44052	0	a	Well
44053	0	a	that is that is
44054	0	a	Yep .
44055	0	a	Actually yeah ,
44056	0	a	we we we will not need the really expert designers because the amount , yeah .
44057	0	a	So .
44058	0	a	Yeah .
44059	0	a	Yep .
44060	0	a	Okay .
44061	0	a	So
44062	1	a	w we can go back and l talk to the suppliers maybe and see if we can drive the prices down to add a few more things in
44063	0	a	but that is all we can do with the restrictions we have at the moment .
44064	0	a	Okay ,
44065	0	a	good .
44066	0	a	Then we the same .
44067	0	a	Thank you .
44068	0	a	Okay .
44069	0	a	That is it .
44070	0	a	 
44071	0	a	How do you wear this thing ?
44072	0	a	Not too many cables and stuff .
44073	0	a	Original .
44074	0	a	Is recorded ?
44075	0	a	Okay ?
44076	0	a	Okay so welcome everyone .
44077	0	a	So we are here for the kickoff meeting of the process of designing a new remote control .
44078	0	a	So I will first start with a warm welcome opening stuff , then we will see what will be our product and what will be the different step we will have to design it .
44079	0	a	And then we will discuss if we have few ideas and we will end by dispatching the different task you will be you will have to fulfil to complete this process .
44080	0	a	So
44081	0	a	sorry ?
44082	0	a	You have another meeting soon ?
44083	0	a	So you have to be quick .
44084	1	a	Just one thing .
44085	0	a	, you said twenty five minutes , but I have something else to do , so gotta have another meeting soon ,
44086	1	a	so maybe you could hurry up a bit
44087	0	a	It is true .
44088	0	a	I have another meeting
44089	1	a	so if you could
44090	0	a	Yeah .
44091	0	a	Yeah ,
44092	0	a	for the lawnmower project .
44093	0	a	Okay .
44094	0	a	Okay .
44095	0	a	So the the goal is to have a remote control so to have an advantage over our competitors
44096	0	a	we have to be original , we have to be trendy and we have to also try to be user friendly .
44097	0	a	So the design step will be divided in three main points .
44098	0	a	First it will be the functional design .
44099	0	a	Third is the conceptual design and then is the desired design .
44100	0	a	So the functional design is to identify the main user needs , the technical function the remote control should fulfil .
44101	0	a	And then we will move to f conceptual design where we will specify the different component involved , what kind of user interf interface we want and what are the different trend in user interface and stuff like that .
44102	0	a	And then the desired devi design will consist in specifically implementing and detailing the choice we have made in the second point .
44103	1	a	So I will now ask you which is very important for the design of a new remote control for to each of us to to draw your favourite animal on the white board .
44104	0	a	What an original idea .
44105	0	a	Do you have any idea of which animal you want to show us ?
44106	0	a	Okay that is good .
44107	0	a	Orangutan .
44108	0	a	No no
44109	0	a	n
44110	1	a	You should write y the name I think .
44111	0	a	n n You should
44112	0	a	If you want to react about this wonderful drawing I will let you comment .
44113	0	a	Can I give you the
44114	0	a	no ?
44115	0	a	But I do not have to say anything .
44116	0	a	When I am drawing the orangutan .
44117	0	a	It is an abstract drawing of an orangutan .
44118	0	a	Okay it is an abstract drawing .
44119	0	a	Yes .
44120	0	a	I think it is nice and original .
44121	0	a	I do not have a red colour .
44122	0	a	Usually orangutans have red hair so this is a very important
44123	0	a	but I do not have red pen , so
44124	0	a	Yes .
44125	0	a	Okay .
44126	1	a	You want to draw something Christine ?
44127	0	a	Of course your animal is recorded so it is not lost .
44128	0	a	Okay
44129	0	a	sorry .
44130	1	a	You have to imagine a little bit .
44131	0	a	This
44132	0	a	Sorry too .
44133	0	a	Yes .
44134	0	a	I know .
44135	0	a	Is this
44136	0	a	okay
44137	0	a	it is pretty .
44138	0	a	Wha what is this strange beast ?
44139	0	a	Is it a monster ?
44140	0	a	It is a cat ?
44141	0	a	I thought these things did not exist .
44142	0	a	Is it beautiful ?
44143	0	a	Do you know ?
44144	0	a	It is a cat .
44145	0	a	Is not it ?
44146	0	a	Yes yes
44147	0	a	is it like that .
44148	0	a	Me
44149	0	a	yeah .
44150	0	a	Is it better ?
44151	0	a	Okay .
44152	0	a	yeah
44153	0	a	Does have a name ?
44154	0	a	Caramel .
44155	0	a	Yeah .
44156	0	a	It is my cat .
44157	0	a	Okay it is your cat .
44158	0	a	Yeah .
44159	0	a	The name is Caramel .
44160	0	a	Caramel .
44161	0	a	Ah ha .
44162	0	a	Yeah .
44163	0	a	Okay .
44164	1	a	Olivier , do you want to
44165	1	a	Okay I go ,
44166	0	a	but next time you will do something I am sure .
44167	0	a	And you
44168	0	a	I think I am too short for the cables .
44169	1	a	Next time I concentrate .
44170	0	a	I am a bit short on cable .
44171	1	a	Okay .
44172	1	a	So what could I draw ?
44173	1	a	Maybe I can draw like a very simplified cow .
44174	0	a	I do not know if it looks like a cow
44175	0	a	Like a what ?
44176	0	a	I dunno it it looks more like a donkey in fact I would say .
44177	0	a	He looks like a bong .
44178	0	a	Okay .
44179	0	a	Sorry .
44180	0	a	No .
44181	0	a	Quite squarey .
44182	0	a	Scary ?
44183	0	a	I I think we will be finished this
44184	0	a	Is it for for putting a for logos , no .
44185	0	a	He also .
44186	0	a	Okay so I hope that it helps you in the process of designing a remote control .
44187	0	a	That is
44188	0	a	I is there a matter for a new remote control ?
44189	0	a	Is it a single device remote control or is it a multi device remote control ?
44190	0	a	this is not defined at all ?
44191	0	a	, okay .
44192	0	a	Okay .
44193	1	a	Let is move on .
44194	0	a	So Here the financial objective of our project .
44195	0	a	That is to say to to have a production cost lower than twelve point five Euros and have a selling price of twice that price t in order to target a profe profit of fifty million Euros .
44196	0	a	Yeah if it is trendy , original I d fulfil the user needs .
44197	0	a	We have to discuss that point .
44198	0	a	On
44199	0	a	yeah
44200	0	a	you you can suggest points like this .
44201	0	a	So what what
44202	0	a	so we have to decide for example if it can control one device or multiple .
44203	0	a	So what is what are your ideas about that ?
44204	0	a	Maybe I can have the your opinion from the marketing side ?
44205	0	a	Okay , so if it selled by its own
44206	0	a	i it
44207	0	a	it would rather be for multiple device .
44208	0	a	Well do we sell other stuff ?
44209	0	a	if if we bundle the remote control with something to sell then it could be a single device , otherwise it could be programmable one
44210	0	a	otherwise who would buy a remote control from us .
44211	0	a	Yeah .
44212	0	a	Do you agree ?
44213	0	a	Yeah .
44214	1	a	So maybe it should be for multiple devices .
44215	1	a	And do you have any ideas of design ideas or any technical requirement we we should fulfil ?
44216	0	a	Few buttons .
44217	1	a	I think we should not have too many b for my part .
44218	0	a	No , I couldn
44219	0	a	I cannot fi think of any requirements right now .
44220	1	a	I think If we do not have so many buttons could be nice .
44221	0	a	Okay .
44222	0	a	And do you have it also to be to be lighted in order to be used in the dark ?
44223	0	a	Might be a good idea .
44224	0	a	Yeah .
44225	0	a	Okay .
44226	1	a	And do you have any any idea of the trend the trend in domain , what it should not it should look like , or things like that ?
44227	0	a	With rou
44228	0	a	okay .
44229	1	a	Something which is not squarey maybe , not a box .
44230	0	a	Like for okay .
44231	1	a	Something like that , least fits in your hand .
44232	0	a	Yeah .
44233	0	a	Okay .
44234	0	a	Yeah .
44235	1	a	The basic requirement .
44236	0	a	So .
44237	0	a	Fit in your hand , yeah .
44238	0	a	Only a buck .
44239	1	a	And also it have , i it may be it may be important for the remote control to be To , to resist to various shocks that can happen if it fall .
44240	1	a	Waterproof .
44241	0	a	Water proof as well .
44242	0	a	And I think we should have a device
44243	0	a	Sorry .
44244	1	a	Maybe it is original because you can use it in your in your bath whereas the others ca not .
44245	0	a	Maybe water proof would be very original .
44246	0	a	Havin having a water proof remote control so that the people can use it in their bath .
44247	0	a	That could be
44248	0	a	Yeah but , it is still something you have to buy
44249	0	a	and that is not maybe very
44250	0	a	Yeah ,
44251	0	a	mayb B
44252	1	a	But maybe we can bulk it with already this plastic thing and the waterproof stuff as well .
44253	0	a	B it seems so ,
44254	1	a	but if you do not have an waterproof remote control it means you can just cover it with some plastic and you can sort of f
44255	0	a	And , and that is one of the that is one of the shock I mean there are people that have a remote control and they are worried that it is going to break and they put some extra plastic around it .
44256	0	a	That is people they actually do it themselves .
44257	0	a	Yeah .
44258	0	a	directly .
44259	0	a	I it will look a bulky in that case .
44260	0	a	Yeah .
44261	0	a	Yeah .
44262	1	a	Maybe we can sell all that together , so so plastic protection and and a waterproof box as well .
44263	1	a	That might be good track to follow .
44264	1	a	Like as an optional thing .
44265	1	a	Optional or selled with it ?
44266	0	a	Yeah .
44267	1	a	And I I think we should have something ,
44268	0	a	most of the time I I lose my remote control .
44269	1	a	We should have s special bu button on the TV to make the remote control beeping .
44270	0	a	Maybe we can have
44271	0	a	But we do not design the TV .
44272	0	a	yeah .
44273	1	a	Maybe we can have something you whistle and the remote control beep .
44274	0	a	Yeah .
44275	1	a	Barks .
44276	0	a	Yeah , barks , yeah .
44277	0	a	Barks .
44278	0	a	So we can have a whistle remote control ?
44279	0	a	I do not know , whistle able ?
44280	0	a	Th
44281	0	a	Whistle tracking
44282	0	a	yeah .
44283	0	a	Yeah .
44284	0	a	Yeah whistle .
44285	1	a	Whistle tracking .
44286	0	a	Whistle tracking remote control .
44287	0	a	That is a good idea , that is very original and that is can improve .
44288	0	a	That is that is quite cool ,
44289	0	a	but of course we you do not normally need any audio recording stuff on your remote control
44290	0	a	right ?
44291	0	a	So i it is just going to add t to the cost .
44292	0	a	Yeah d d .
44293	0	a	Yeah but s still we have to we have to have an advantage over our competitors .
44294	0	a	I think this is a good advantage .
44295	0	a	It is cool .
44296	0	a	I think I like the idea , but I am not sure about the what you ,
44297	0	a	who is giving who is giving who is giving our budget .
44298	0	a	Yeah .
44299	0	a	We have to ask
44300	0	a	Yeah .
44301	0	a	Who is
44302	0	a	Yeah .
44303	0	a	We have to ask the quest of that is design to the Industrial Designer .
44304	0	a	Yeah .
44305	0	a	Yeah .
44306	0	a	Which is you .
44307	0	a	Kay .
44308	0	a	yeah
44309	0	a	Okay .
44310	1	a	Okay so try to find that for next meeting .
44311	0	a	Okay .
44312	0	a	So
44313	0	a	next meeting is in thirty minutes or
44314	0	a	so .
44315	0	a	Do not panic .
44316	0	a	Do not pani .
44317	0	a	So so I will ask the Industrial Designer to find out more about this industrial design so any working any working function we have discussed .
44318	0	a	So then I will ask the User Interf Interface Designer to to think about the point we discussed like the number of buttons , the the fact that is lighted or not , things like that , and what would be convenient for the user .
44319	0	a	And also I will ask the Market Expert to try to find out what are the absolute requirements , what is absolutely needed in a remote control for the user .
44320	0	a	So .
44321	1	a	And then I will just ask you to think about that
44322	0	a	and look at your mail because you will receive some good advice soon .
44323	0	a	So .
44324	0	a	Thank you
44325	0	a	I think that is all for this point .
44326	0	a	Good .
44327	0	a	, so we come back in five minutes ?
44328	0	a	Anyway you will receive some messages .
44329	1	a	Be careful .
44330	0	a	You eat it ?
44331	0	a	Does it move ?
44332	0	a	Okay ,
44333	0	a	but I do not know if it is still correctly
44334	0	a	 
44335	0	a	Okay .
44336	0	a	Okay everyone is ready .
44337	0	a	Hello .
44338	0	a	So we are here for for functional design .
44339	0	a	Okay ?
44340	0	a	So we are here for the functional design meeting
44341	1	a	so first I will show the agenda so
44342	0	a	we will
44343	0	a	I will take notes during this meeting
44344	0	a	so I will try to summarise it and put that summary in the shared folder if you want to look at it afterwards so then each of you will lead a presentation on the task that has been required last time so user requirement specification , technical function design and working design .
44345	0	a	Then I will present you some new project requirements I received from the management board .
44346	0	a	Then we will take the decision on on the remote control needed functions and then I will assign you the task for the next part of the meeting .
44347	0	a	Of the of the process .
44348	1	a	So who want to start the the presentation of what they did ?
44349	1	a	You can start .
44350	1	a	F do you want to start ?
44351	0	a	Okay .
44352	1	a	Make a start
44353	1	a	yeah .
44354	0	a	So .
44355	0	a	Cable , camera .
44356	0	a	You have PowerPoint ?
44357	0	a	yeah maybe there .
44358	0	a	Should be in my in their folder
44359	0	a	no ?
44360	0	a	Up .
44361	0	a	Okay .
44362	0	a	Who are you ?
44363	0	a	Ouch .
44364	0	a	at three I think .
44365	0	a	No ?
44366	0	a	And
44367	0	a	We have a technical problem .
44368	0	a	Do we think w s in the in the wrong folder maybe ?
44369	0	a	It is possible .
44370	0	a	You put it on
44371	0	a	Yeah .
44372	0	a	No .
44373	0	a	It was somewhere in something like this .
44374	0	a	I do not remember the name actually must be something like messenger AMI or something .
44375	0	a	What do you have in short cut ?
44376	0	a	Participant two .
44377	1	a	Go up .
44378	1	a	Yeah go up .
44379	1	a	Again .
44380	0	a	No .
44381	1	a	Go back .
44382	0	a	You have no
44383	0	a	Over .
44384	0	a	maybe messenger AMI .
44385	0	a	Messenger .
44386	0	a	Okay .
44387	0	a	No .
44388	0	a	There is nothing .
44389	0	a	There is no
44390	0	a	We have a technical problem .
44391	1	a	Let is go and check .
44392	0	a	Yeah .
44393	1	a	I will go and check .
44394	1	a	Otherwise , could you just describe by hand ?
44395	1	a	With the the whiteboard ?
44396	0	a	Okay .
44397	0	a	Yeah .
44398	0	a	If you remember yeah
44399	0	a	but that is
44400	0	a	Yeah .
44401	0	a	Yeah .
44402	0	a	So .
44403	0	a	Basically what we want here is a remote control
44404	0	a	right .
44405	0	a	So the question well first of all what to control .
44406	0	a	So most people want to have a a remote for their hi fi and TV and stuff like that .
44407	0	a	And but other people want th also remotes for controlling and toys like robotic pets and little robots and stuff and other people also want to have remotes for controlling whole house .
44408	0	a	Yeah .
44409	0	a	Yeah ,
44410	0	a	so there is a project I think called X house or something like that that does that , you can integrate your remote with computers stuff .
44411	0	a	So
44412	0	a	there is one that is one thing .
44413	0	a	The other is the the finder feature
44414	0	a	yeah
44415	0	a	by whistling or whatever .
44416	0	a	if you have the finder feature then you can also have at the same time as and general voice commands if you want
44417	0	a	yeah .
44418	0	a	Okay .
44419	0	a	So I think it should be a package in that case .
44420	0	a	so the user interface will consist of two parts .
44421	0	a	One is the voice command part and on one is the actual buttons part .
44422	0	a	and th the buttons part would be a set of buttons for choosing devices , a set of buttons for special navigation in space , a set of buttons for linear access of medium and a set of buttons for random access .
44423	0	a	Okay .
44424	0	a	Yeah ?
44425	0	a	Like a video tape goes forward , backwards , fast and stuff
44426	0	a	yeah .
44427	0	a	What do you mean by linear access then ?
44428	0	a	Okay so special navigation , linear access , random access
44429	0	a	and there is a fourth one
44430	0	a	no ?
44431	0	a	So the better now for special navigation ?
44432	0	a	Okay .
44433	0	a	Yeah .
44434	0	a	For special navigation for example you might have a TV in the menu and you going to change
44435	0	a	yeah ?
44436	0	a	Then linear access then random access .
44437	0	a	Yeah
44438	0	a	and also parameter changing .
44439	0	a	yeah parameter
44440	0	a	okay .
44441	1	a	So if there are common parameters maybe we should put special buttons for that or maybe we could have everything generic
44442	0	a	but there are a lot of remotes on the market right now
44443	0	a	and basically this is most of the almost everybody has this stuff .
44444	0	a	Okay .
44445	0	a	Okay .
44446	0	a	Okay
44447	0	a	and and voice command did you
44448	0	a	Okay .
44449	0	a	Voice command w we could specify anything .
44450	0	a	We could assign any button a command to any button , if we have enough processing power ,
44451	0	a	I guess so .
44452	0	a	Okay .
44453	0	a	Yeah .
44454	0	a	Okay .
44455	0	a	Yeah .
44456	0	a	So that is that close your investigations ?
44457	0	a	Okay .
44458	0	a	Yeah .
44459	0	a	yeah I think so .
44460	0	a	Not so far .
44461	0	a	Okay .
44462	1	a	Maybe we can have a look at the user requirements with
44463	0	a	I dunno if I can open it .
44464	1	a	Yeah .
44465	0	a	I dunno if you can open the
44466	0	a	m is not here .
44467	0	a	Maybe you can s
44468	0	a	It is
44469	0	a	Messenger no ?
44470	0	a	In which folder ?
44471	0	a	Short cut to AMI shared folder ?
44472	1	a	Maybe you can send it to me by email .
44473	0	a	in
44474	0	a	yeah okay .
44475	0	a	No .
44476	0	a	In document .
44477	0	a	computer
44478	0	a	yeah .
44479	0	a	Where did you put it ?
44480	0	a	Here .
44481	0	a	Here .
44482	0	a	But it is not
44483	0	a	Just to participant one .
44484	0	a	At AMI .
44485	1	a	Yeah , I can do that .
44486	1	a	I will try to show it to everyone ,
44487	0	a	that would be more comfortable .
44488	0	a	Okay .
44489	0	a	You send it ?
44490	0	a	Yeah .
44491	0	a	It is participant one ?
44492	0	a	Okay .
44493	0	a	this is this email .
44494	0	a	I am designing the user interface .
44495	0	a	You can .
44496	0	a	Okay .
44497	1	a	So maybe I can switch slides when you whenever you ask ,
44498	0	a	that will be more convenient .
44499	0	a	Yeah .
44500	0	a	So okay ,
44501	0	a	functional requirements .
44502	1	a	Okay so you can you can go .
44503	0	a	Okay so
44504	0	a	in our usability lab we observed the remote control use among one hundred subjects and the subjects also filled a questionnaire
44505	0	a	okay ?
44506	0	a	And here I have the results so you can see that seventy five per cent of users find most remote controls ugly
44507	1	a	so we have to find something to make them more more nice , more kind .
44508	0	a	Yeah .
44509	0	a	Eighty per cents of users would spend more money when the remote control would look fancy .
44510	0	a	Eighty hundred per cent of users would spend more money when the remote control would look
44511	0	a	oh
44512	0	a	to
44513	0	a	it is not good .
44514	0	a	So okay .
44515	0	a	So it is not in theory
44516	1	a	but I
44517	1	a	I can I can say yeah .
44518	1	a	We can just keep doing that ?
44519	0	a	Yeah .
44520	0	a	Fifty f
44521	0	a	seventy five per cent of users say they s zap a lot .
44522	1	a	So we have to have a remote control very out for that .
44523	0	a	the buttons have are to be like you say resist resisting to to shocks .
44524	0	a	Okay .
44525	0	a	and fifty per cents of users say they only use ten per cents of but of the buttons in the in the remote control .
44526	0	a	Okay .
44527	1	a	So all the buttons we we have to put are have to to have a use a real use
44528	0	a	and not only or
44529	0	a	Yeah .
44530	0	a	Okay .
44531	0	a	Okay ,
44532	0	a	so fewer buttons maybe would be good ?
44533	0	a	Okay .
44534	1	a	F not many buttons , and and u useable buttons .
44535	0	a	But what kind of remote controls did you look at ?
44536	0	a	What kind of task was it ?
44537	0	a	It was a TV ?
44538	0	a	Huh .
44539	0	a	Sorry ?
44540	0	a	Yeah .
44541	0	a	most for most is TV .
44542	0	a	Yeah .
44543	0	a	Yeah
44544	0	a	but in fact we it it seems that we are going to make a TV remote control according to new requirements I received from the management
44545	1	a	bo I will present them in the following .
44546	0	a	Uh huh .
44547	0	a	! Good .
44548	0	a	Okay .
44549	1	a	Kay you can go so .
44550	0	a	So there are other frustrations expressed by users , so they said they lost often the remote control in in the room
44551	0	a	so they want to have a way to to to find it .
44552	0	a	Yeah .
44553	0	a	To find it .
44554	0	a	Yeah .
44555	0	a	and
44556	0	a	lot of the time they it takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote control .
44557	0	a	Yeah .
44558	0	a	So they want something s really very simple and easy to use .
44559	0	a	Okay .
44560	0	a	And remote controls are bad for RSI I dunno .
44561	0	a	What is her other side ?
44562	0	a	Oh yeah ?
44563	0	a	I did not knew that .
44564	0	a	Other side
44565	0	a	yeah ,
44566	0	a	yo wa your wrist
44567	0	a	It i can become painful
44568	0	a	you can have tendonditis .
44569	0	a	Yeah .
44570	0	a	If you also up on a computer in a strange position .
44571	0	a	Okay
44572	1	a	so you we have to make it more ergonomic
44573	1	a	yeah .
44574	0	a	Ergonomic .
44575	0	a	But .
44576	0	a	Have to say ha ha .
44577	0	a	Yeah .
44578	0	a	It is your job
44579	0	a	Oh .
44580	0	a	sorry
44581	0	a	got a message from Microsoft .
44582	0	a	Okay before that I I have some some some thing to say before We know that the user use a lot their remote control to to change channel .
44583	0	a	Yeah .
44584	0	a	Yeah yeah .
44585	0	a	Yeah .
44586	0	a	and to to change volume selection of the and and not a lot for setting for setting the the channels and thing things like that .
44587	0	a	Okay .
44588	0	a	Yeah .
44589	0	a	Okay .
44590	0	a	So it is better to put something very easy to set
44591	0	a	and and
44592	0	a	Very accessible yes .
44593	0	a	Yeah .
44594	0	a	This function should be very accessible .
44595	0	a	Yeah , okay .
44596	0	a	That is right .
44597	0	a	This is the main function okay .
44598	0	a	So then we asked some questions to them and we asked this question if they prefer an LCD screen or on their remultific function remotes control and if they pay more for speech recognition in remote control
44599	0	a	and you can go
44600	0	a	we have here the results of of the questions .
44601	0	a	Yeah .
44602	0	a	Yeah .
44603	0	a	Yeah .
44604	0	a	The first question .
44605	0	a	So you know that for the younger it is very important
44606	0	a	to have the
44607	0	a	s yes
44608	0	a	and speech recognition .
44609	0	a	To have LCD and voice .
44610	0	a	And and the others is not so important
44611	0	a	but we know that people between fifteen and twenty five are people who watch a lot TV and who who wh can use a lot this .
44612	0	a	Okay .
44613	1	a	So maybe we we can have a speech recognition in .
44614	0	a	Yeah maybe this this is important .
44615	0	a	Yeah .
44616	0	a	Moreover th maybe those like those teenager customer could advice their parents to buy this equipment
44617	0	a	and so we can
44618	0	a	we have to take care of that point of view I think
44619	0	a	or so .
44620	0	a	Yeah .
44621	0	a	Okay and if there is th the conclusion now .
44622	0	a	So as we say before , I think a remote control lightening in the dark it is it is a good thing .
44623	0	a	Okay .
44624	0	a	not to many mud buttons like we we said before , e easy to use a way to find it easily in the room and resistant to to shock
44625	0	a	and to to
44626	0	a	An
44627	0	a	I s no ,
44628	0	a	yeah .
44629	0	a	Yeah .
44630	0	a	Okay .
44631	0	a	Okay these are the user requi
44632	0	a	Yeah .
44633	1	a	I dunno if you see something else important or
44634	0	a	I am just thinking of some thing .
44635	0	a	We want to have a
44636	0	a	no , I do not know if this is a good idea .
44637	0	a	We want to have a a general remote control for everything .
44638	0	a	No no no .
44639	0	a	We w it seems that we no want to have a TV remote control .
44640	0	a	Okay .
44641	0	a	From the management board I receive an email .
44642	0	a	Yeah .
44643	0	a	Cos it would be costly and and also it it would take more time to develop to have a a general generic remote control .
44644	0	a	Yeah .
44645	0	a	Yeah yeah .
44646	0	a	Yeah .
44647	0	a	I it is not true I think .
44648	0	a	The the second claim that you put .
44649	0	a	No no .
44650	0	a	That it would be too long to develop .
44651	0	a	Yeah .
44652	0	a	I think that should be the same .
44653	0	a	Oh yeah .
44654	0	a	Because I received that email from management board and they seems to tell that that if we want to be on the market as early as possible we should focus on TV more where it seems that the market is more important .
44655	0	a	So maybe it is a good decision .
44656	0	a	I dunno .
44657	0	a	What is your opinion ?
44658	0	a	Okay .
44659	0	a	I have I have no idea
44660	0	a	I mean I should know a bit more about how fast we can design it .
44661	0	a	I do not think
44662	0	a	yeah .
44663	0	a	Finish tonight .
44664	0	a	Yeah .
44665	0	a	Okay .
44666	1	a	But basically yeah maybe I can continue with my presentation ,
44667	0	a	it would be al you you
44668	0	a	but I think we have some technical problem or so .
44669	0	a	Yeah .
44670	0	a	Yeah .
44671	0	a	Yeah .
44672	1	a	So I am just going to describe briefly what we do in the remote control .
44673	1	a	Maybe you can go to the whiteboard if you have some drawings to do
44674	0	a	I do not know .
44675	0	a	If fact
44676	0	a	Yeah
44677	0	a	but Do I have
44678	0	a	oh yeah .
44679	0	a	Now I have enough cables .
44680	0	a	Like a
44681	0	a	you feel a bit like a dog with this stuff .
44682	0	a	Okay so I am just going to describe
44683	0	a	in fact for for a remote control this is quite easy .
44684	0	a	We just have
44685	0	a	sorry ,
44686	0	a	I am going Like that .
44687	0	a	Okay .
44688	0	a	Are you okay ?
44689	0	a	UC is the central unit ?
44690	0	a	Okay yeah .
44691	1	a	I am just going to describe .
44692	0	a	Basically we have a a battery a power supply here .
44693	0	a	After that we just have user interface .
44694	0	a	Let is say that
44695	0	a	something like that , which could be a LCD let is say or an array of push button , something like that .
44696	0	a	Push button or a LCD .
44697	0	a	After that we we feed that into an electronic chip .
44698	0	a	So I say UC and I feed that to LED which is infrared which is a an infrared component .
44699	0	a	And so what we for for myself this
44700	0	a	for for us this is quite easy .
44701	0	a	Yeah .
44702	0	a	Y it is a it is this just a chip which does all the numerical numerical computation according to your display .
44703	0	a	Computation .
44704	0	a	Okay .
44705	0	a	And so for us this is quite easy .
44706	0	a	We just need to take
44707	0	a	to define what we want to do when the user interface wants something and after that we just do the coding to s and send that to to to the not the to the television .
44708	0	a	Okay .
44709	0	a	So for us this is quite easy .
44710	0	a	Okay so this is quite easy .
44711	0	a	Yeah .
44712	0	a	we just have to define the processing power that we need especially if we want to do some speech recognition , in that case that mean that we are going to use more for simple
44713	0	a	Yeah of course of course .
44714	0	a	There is not that much constraints .
44715	0	a	This will think this will take more time to develop also .
44716	0	a	Yeah .
44717	0	a	And
44718	0	a	but for a standard one this is really easy .
44719	0	a	It is a question of one month and so on s
44720	0	a	No
44721	0	a	no no no ,
44722	0	a	I say
44723	0	a	yeah standard standard remote control takes maybe one month to to do that .
44724	0	a	Soon .
44725	0	a	To have a
44726	0	a	you s you speak about with voi voice control ?
44727	0	a	Standard button one .
44728	0	a	Yeah .
44729	0	a	So the only time problem is the sp voice recognition .
44730	0	a	Yeah .
44731	0	a	Yeah .
44732	0	a	Definitely .
44733	0	a	Yeah .
44734	0	a	So do you have any idea of how long it would take to have voice recognition now ?
44735	0	a	Okay so i it is a bit long
44736	0	a	yeah .
44737	0	a	I would say .
44738	0	a	Ten years .
44739	0	a	I would say about eight months to have the first results .
44740	0	a	Yeah .
44741	0	a	I can
44742	0	a	One month for the standard one with button .
44743	0	a	Yeah .
44744	0	a	Even if we have a LCD display ?
44745	0	a	Okay yeah .
44746	0	a	Yeah even .
44747	0	a	I mean that this is really standard devices now .
44748	0	a	eight .
44749	0	a	For speech recognition .
44750	0	a	Okay
44751	1	a	so we can take this into account .
44752	0	a	So who think it would be good to go for like speech recognition ?
44753	0	a	Yeah it will .
44754	0	a	But we do not have time to market .
44755	0	a	And also how much I think
44756	0	a	during the kickoff meeting you say that we we should not we should not go up to twelve point five Euro per unit
44757	0	a	so how many units should we sell to have a
44758	0	a	Yeah
44759	0	a	but how many
44760	0	a	yeah .
44761	1	a	I think we should contact management .
44762	0	a	Euros .
44763	0	a	Yeah ,
44764	0	a	yeah .
44765	0	a	Well .
44766	0	a	Well each unit is is sell twenty five Euros .
44767	0	a	How muc how much do you get how much do you if you buy one million units h no , one hundred thousand units .
44768	0	a	Eh chips .
44769	0	a	We are going to need chips right .
44770	0	a	Yeah .
44771	0	a	Yeah .
44772	0	a	How much will it cost for one hundred thousand ?
44773	0	a	Okay .
44774	0	a	Usually this is less tha at two dollars per chip .
44775	0	a	Because we are
44776	0	a	It seems that that we want to sell like four million units from the first meeting .
44777	1	a	So you have any idea for a powerful one that has good enough for do speech recognition .
44778	0	a	Yeah ,
44779	0	a	we can
44780	0	a	Yeah ?
44781	0	a	Okay .
44782	0	a	So .
44783	0	a	No it does not .
44784	0	a	Okay .
44785	0	a	Four million .
44786	0	a	Okay .
44787	1	a	Maybe we can we can look at the new requirement I receive from the management board and discus discuss all function we want to have .
44788	0	a	I just had a question
44789	0	a	do you want to continue with your presenta ?
44790	0	a	Is it
44791	0	a	you say that I do not remember by heart but thirty per cent of the tested people say that is it is quite difficult to to to use the remote control .
44792	0	a	Yeah I I will continue .
44793	1	a	Well ask your question if you want .
44794	0	a	Yeah .
44795	0	a	Do they say that this is difficult but for the same reason or do they have other reason ?
44796	0	a	To to
44797	1	a	maybe to keep in mind maybe to access to that menu you should do something like that .
44798	0	a	Oh .
44799	0	a	Would j
44800	0	a	yeah
44801	0	a	w I
44802	0	a	I think
44803	0	a	they
44804	0	a	they say that it is difficult to learn how to use it
44805	0	a	but i
44806	0	a	when you know how to use it , it is it is okay .
44807	0	a	Okay .
44808	0	a	And But yeah maybe
44809	1	a	and what about if we design a remote control which can be configure as you want ?
44810	0	a	You say that I want , I have six button
44811	0	a	Yeah .
44812	0	a	But
44813	0	a	Yeah .
44814	0	a	It is not intuitive first .
44815	0	a	Mh hmm .
44816	0	a	A a lot of people are
44817	0	a	if you have the LCD screen if you can do it completely the way you want because the buttons also look the way you want them but it will be hard to configure
44818	0	a	I mean imagine i
44819	0	a	so it is really something for the expert user .
44820	0	a	Yeah .
44821	0	a	Yeah .
44822	0	a	But , but also it seems that
44823	0	a	Yeah .
44824	0	a	Yeah .
44825	0	a	Okay .
44826	0	a	So
44827	0	a	I mean there are markets and markets .
44828	0	a	I think the young people are th are
44829	0	a	Christine here said you have a
44830	0	a	it is
44831	0	a	yeah .
44832	0	a	Yeah .
44833	0	a	Yeah .
44834	0	a	So for our young people it will be cool , they can be able to use it .
44835	0	a	Th maybe their parents will not but they will configure it .
44836	0	a	I guess .
44837	0	a	I do not know if there is study about that .
44838	0	a	Yeah .
44839	0	a	Maybe it would be more complex to configure it to be simple than creating a simple product .
44840	0	a	Yeah .
44841	0	a	Yeah .
44842	0	a	Yeah .
44843	0	a	And there are
44844	0	a	another thing is that if we make something that is simple and easy to use that is bas to use immediately that means that it will be exactly the same as everything else .
44845	0	a	Yeah .
44846	0	a	Yeah .
44847	0	a	All right ?
44848	0	a	Otherwise , if it is different then of course everybody has somebody has to learn to use it first .
44849	0	a	Yeah .
44850	0	a	Yeah .
44851	0	a	Yeah .
44852	0	a	But also we we see that that most people find it find remote controls too complex because they have too many buttons and they mainly use only channels and volume buttons .
44853	1	a	So we may just make a very easy to use remote control with mainly those buttons and maybe also some lightning stuff too
44854	0	a	because most people find also hard to to find the remote control .
44855	0	a	Yeah .
44856	0	a	Losed lose it etcetera .
44857	0	a	These these are
44858	0	a	these two points are the main frustrations
44859	1	a	so maybe if we design something very simple and easy to find when lost it will add a serious competitive advantage without making something too complex and too long to develop .
44860	1	a	So but le let us see first the new requirement .
44861	0	a	So we do not have to
44862	0	a	so this this is is in the
44863	0	a	this is in the same direction as we were speaking so we do not have to make a very complex remote controls to access teletext and stuff like that
44864	0	a	Yeah
44865	0	a	but then you have to you have to define the buttons to surf amongst pages and stuff .
44866	0	a	But teletext is just one button .
44867	0	a	You you just write the write the numbers .
44868	0	a	Yeah .
44869	0	a	So well
44870	0	a	Yeah .
44871	0	a	So will you add with the channel keys , right ?
44872	0	a	So .
44873	0	a	So anyway we do not have to include this feature because it is it is not used any more by users ,
44874	0	a	they prefer to s
44875	0	a	Yeah .
44876	0	a	I am .
44877	0	a	I am sure that it do not like
44878	0	a	but I do not see just one button .
44879	0	a	So .
44880	0	a	I dunno .
44881	0	a	If i one button is still one more button .
44882	0	a	If if
44883	1	a	if we want to make it very simple we have to reduce number of buttons compared to th to our competitors .
44884	0	a	Well anyway I have this point .
44885	1	a	We can discuss .
44886	0	a	Also so
44887	0	a	as as I told before it would be better if it is only for the TV because we want to be quick on on the market .
44888	0	a	And then also we have to make very clear that this this remote control is is part of of our products and show our corporate logo and and colours on the on the design as well so that they identify it as one of our product .
44889	0	a	So this is the the key point .
44890	0	a	So before finishing we can define what would be the characteristic of the o th of the control of the remote control and which button do we need which function do we want etcetera .
44891	0	a	Capital .
44892	0	a	So
44893	0	a	do you so
44894	0	a	so from from the the Marketing Expert I think a key aspect is the easy to use aspect , it should be very simple and most button are never used only ten per cent of the button are are used often
44895	1	a	so I think we have to do something very simple
44896	0	a	and I think we all agree on that point ,
44897	0	a	no ?
44898	0	a	Yeah okay .
44899	0	a	Well if it is going to be just a TV remote control it is going to be very simple .
44900	0	a	So yeah the key point here is simple .
44901	0	a	Maybe .
44902	0	a	So few buttons , channel , volume control
44903	1	a	and what el what function do you see in addition to that ?
44904	0	a	Yeah .
44905	0	a	Well if it is going to be as simple as possible then just have the remote control , there is no other function that I can see
44906	0	a	really .
44907	1	a	Maybe switch TV on and off
44908	0	a	Yeah .
44909	0	a	no you want to keep television on so that the advertising can revenue can come back to us .
44910	0	a	Or something .
44911	0	a	Yeah .
44912	1	a	Volume , maybe a mute button , and then on off button .
44913	0	a	And that is all ?
44914	0	a	I know that som
44915	0	a	you say that many people are doing plenty of a lot of zapping .
44916	0	a	I know tha
44917	0	a	I discovered that when I did a quick look , they do now som they do something which is quite nice now , you have a button , you you press it , and this is the previous channel which has come back .
44918	0	a	It is a memory , yeah .
44919	0	a	Okay .
44920	0	a	Yeah this is cool .
44921	1	a	Maybe we can include that also .
44922	1	a	Previous previous channel button .
44923	1	a	So we have like channel button , the previous channel button , the volume button , plus a mute button , and just the the traditional on off button .
44924	0	a	And and of course the channel changing buttons .
44925	0	a	Yeah .
44926	1	a	I I talk about that ,
44927	1	a	yeah ?
44928	0	a	Yeah .
44929	1	a	How should they how should we implement that ?
44930	0	a	Because could be numerical only or could be also incremental .
44931	1	a	Incremental definitely because zapping you you switch them .
44932	1	a	Let is say that we can do something like that .
44933	1	a	This is incremental , but once you press it for a long time , you go five by five .
44934	0	a	We go faster ?
44935	0	a	To go fa to go faster .
44936	0	a	It is an interesting idea , that if you press it for a long time it does something else , in general .
44937	0	a	So if you you have your ten buttons for the for the numeric the numerical buttons and you have instead of having just one memory you have if you press them for a long time
44938	0	a	No .
44939	0	a	Yeah .
44940	0	a	Does not work
44941	0	a	does it .
44942	1	a	Maybe we should have also a digit button
44943	0	a	Yeah .
44944	0	a	Maybe we should have a complete keyboard and just type console commands .
44945	0	a	Change channel to eight .
44946	0	a	No .
44947	1	a	Maybe we have also to have digits or only incremental .
44948	0	a	I dunno bec because if you have the
44949	0	a	Well if it is useful like
44950	0	a	if if you want to change between three channels for example then you h you cannot you cannot cannot work with just memory being incremental .
44951	0	a	Yeah .
44952	0	a	Because you have your previous channel button if you have incremental only it is not it is not worth it because the previous channel is eith either minus one or plus one .
44953	0	a	Yeah .
44954	0	a	Yeah .
44955	0	a	Yeah .
44956	0	a	So I think we need also digits .
44957	0	a	Okay .
44958	1	a	Maybe we we can make very obvious the channel and volume button button and smaller button down there with the the digits .
44959	0	a	Yeah when you zap usually you will have to press the same button all the time
44960	0	a	and
44961	0	a	Yeah .
44962	0	a	Yeah .
44963	1	a	Or we can do something like that .
44964	1	a	We can design the remote control to have access .
44965	0	a	You know some remote control have protection
44966	0	a	and so you you
44967	0	a	y
44968	0	a	You
44969	0	a	Yeah ,
44970	0	a	a kind of joystick .
44971	0	a	Yeah .
44972	0	a	Hey I just thought this thing
44973	0	a	there is a
44974	0	a	I mean you know there is are some with a wheel like this .
44975	0	a	Instead of having the up down buttons for you can have the wheel .
44976	0	a	Yeah .
44977	0	a	Yeah .
44978	0	a	Yeah .
44979	1	a	Maybe we can have a wheel for incremental .
44980	0	a	Yeah .
44981	0	a	Okay .
44982	1	a	So have a wheel for incremental , have the digits on the lower side that can be closed
44983	0	a	so as you say protected ,
44984	0	a	and yeah I think this is the basi
44985	0	a	And do we do we have a
44986	0	a	No , a wheel is better .
44987	0	a	On the lower side I think it you have to turn it .
44988	0	a	No ?
44989	0	a	If we do that .
44990	1	a	Or a or a ball ,
44991	0	a	yeah ,
44992	1	a	not a a wheel but a ball ,
44993	0	a	and you say to
44994	0	a	Yeah .
44995	0	a	Yeah .
44996	0	a	I would say the wheel is better .
44997	0	a	Because of that The channels change one by one .
44998	0	a	What is the expert of
44999	0	a	Okay .
45000	0	a	Yeah .
45001	0	a	So you have to
45002	0	a	the user has to like to should feel the the the discrete sense a bit .
45003	0	a	Yeah ,
45004	0	a	the
45005	0	a	yeah .
45006	0	a	Yeah .
45007	0	a	Yeah .
45008	0	a	That is a good idea .
45009	0	a	Well also we have to decide
45010	1	a	so it should be lightening in the dark I think because most people lost their remote control .
45011	0	a	Is quite it is quite easy we do that
45012	0	a	w with back light on the on the wheel .
45013	0	a	Okay .
45014	0	a	Yeah .
45015	0	a	Even if i LED or a if if it is the LCD feature
45016	0	a	whatever ,
45017	0	a	yeah .
45018	0	a	A blue a blue LED and we sell that .
45019	0	a	Yeah ,
45020	0	a	and do we put an LCD display ?
45021	0	a	Because it was important for young customers if you remember .
45022	0	a	Yeah .
45023	0	a	I think it is only put on if cou have multi function .
45024	0	a	Yeah .
45025	0	a	If you do not multi function then there is no p point in having LCD .
45026	0	a	Just increase the cost .
45027	0	a	Okay .
45028	0	a	The user does not have an advantage really .
45029	1	a	So no LCD ?
45030	1	a	And so no speech as well because it w it would delay too much the development process
45031	0	a	Okay .
45032	0	a	Well if it is going to delay
45033	0	a	yeah
45034	0	a	but it will be cool .
45035	0	a	It would .
45036	0	a	Because a user could say CNN for example and it would go CNN .
45037	0	a	Yeah .
45038	0	a	That would be cool .
45039	0	a	But eight months is really long
45040	0	a	and Maybe we can just
45041	0	a	Okay .
45042	0	a	Yeah .
45043	0	a	Ten years
45044	0	a	So I I will
45045	0	a	I will
45046	0	a	so I we will move to next meeting so in after the lunch break here are the individual action you are required to do but you will be recalled to the actions by email
45047	0	a	I think
45048	0	a	but you can take notes if you if you want
45049	0	a	but well the instruction will be sent .
45050	0	a	So
45051	0	a	thank you for your suggestion
45052	1	a	and I I will make a summary of that meeting that I will put in the shared folder you ca not see
45053	0	a	and and then you will you will be able to to see what has been has been said on on this meeting and and what has been decided .
45054	0	a	Okay .
45055	0	a	Okay .
45056	1	a	maybe for next meeting send me your presentation before by email so that we can see them altogether .
45057	0	a	Yeah .
45058	0	a	That would be easier .
45059	0	a	What is the folder that you put yours in ?
45060	0	a	And did it it did work ?
45061	0	a	yeah .
45062	0	a	No .
45063	0	a	No it did not work .
45064	0	a	No no .
45065	0	a	She send it to me by email .
45066	0	a	I dunno ,
45067	0	a	I dunno it .
45068	0	a	Okay .
45069	0	a	So maybe this is better , to send it by email .
45070	0	a	Okay
45071	0	a	what is your email ?
45072	0	a	At participant one .
45073	0	a	Okay ?
45074	0	a	So
45075	0	a	yeah
45076	0	a	I
45077	0	a	I am
45078	0	a	it is in the first email
45079	0	a	so I am participant one at AMI
45080	0	a	where is that ,
45081	0	a	it is here .
45082	0	a	Okay .
45083	0	a	Participant one at AMI .
45084	0	a	Okay .
45085	0	a	Well during lunch break actually .
45086	0	a	So next time we should have a fight .
45087	0	a	How about management or something .
45088	0	a	 
45089	0	a	Okay .
45090	0	a	So we are here for the concept design meeting .
45091	0	a	So , we will first start by summarizing the the previous meeting and the decision we have taken .
45092	0	a	I will take notes during this meeting so that you can look at my folder to see the summary of this meeting afterwards .
45093	0	a	So each of you will show us the various investigation they have done during previous hours .
45094	0	a	We will then t take decision in concert and then we will define the nest next task , to have to be done before the next meeting .
45095	0	a	So , last time we decided to have a simple interface .
45096	0	a	We also decided to have a wheel to change channel previous channel button .
45097	0	a	Channel digit buttons should be protected by plastic cover or something for the remote control to look very simple .
45098	0	a	We have also button for volume , and to switch on off the TV .
45099	0	a	We have also the lightening feature for the remote control to be easy to find , and for fast development and low cost we have decided to have no LCD no voice features .
45100	0	a	So now we will have three presentations .
45101	0	a	So the conceptual specification by Industrial Designer , the specification of the UI by or UI
45102	0	a	okay .
45103	0	a	Abdul al Hasred is my name .
45104	0	a	And the last point is trend watching by Market Expert .
45105	1	a	So maybe we can start with industrial design .
45106	0	a	So this is the presentation .
45107	0	a	, ID you want ?
45108	0	a	Yeah .
45109	1	a	Maybe I can switch slide on your request .
45110	0	a	I only v have three slides , so .
45111	0	a	I just look at the just this .
45112	0	a	On some web pages to find some documentation
45113	0	a	and I think a remote control is , as I s mentioned previously
45114	0	a	, you just have a a very simple chip and the the user interface is just done usually by push button and in our case we are using a a wheel control .
45115	0	a	Yeah .
45116	0	a	So I was looking basically for that chip , which is very very standard , and I just looked for the wheel sensor and the standard push button .
45117	0	a	And
45118	1	a	yeah we can change directly .
45119	0	a	Yeah .
45120	0	a	In fact I have the number of that element which is very standard for remote control .
45121	0	a	The push button are usually extremely cheap , but I just have one problem and this is related with the wheel sensor , which seems to be quite expensive .
45122	0	a	Okay .
45123	1	a	And I think we if we could just talk about that if we really need a wheel sensor or if we can not if if we could combine something with the push button .
45124	0	a	Okay .
45125	0	a	a wheel sensor is fifty time the price of a a a push button .
45126	0	a	Yeah .
45127	0	a	But is it a significant price on the whole remote control ?
45128	0	a	Because we can afford up to twelve Euros for the price of the remote control .
45129	0	a	Yeah .
45130	0	a	Yeah
45131	0	a	I I th
45132	0	a	But I do not think that we should
45133	1	a	We should talk about the design of the box also which needs some money .
45134	0	a	So will will will this with including all possible things , so buttons , wheel and the chip , be lower than twelve Euros to produce ?
45135	0	a	Okay
45136	0	a	You received something
45137	0	a	Yeah .
45138	1	a	Also have to say
45139	0	a	Did you receive the email about the voice recognition ?
45140	0	a	No ?
45141	0	a	Yeah .
45142	0	a	But that is all
45143	0	a	yeah .
45144	0	a	I have not chec
45145	0	a	You we an email from the manufacturing division that they have basically a voice recognition chip already developed .
45146	0	a	Says
45147	0	a	Yeah .
45148	0	a	It says that ri right now they just use it to to record answers to particular questions .
45149	0	a	But I guess it could be
45150	0	a	I guess it is possible .
45151	0	a	And could it be adapted ?
45152	0	a	Okay and there can recognize some commands and stuff ?
45153	0	a	Okay .
45154	0	a	I mean instead of recording the answers you can just record something simpler like a command .
45155	0	a	Yeah you reco recognize commands and you can record new commands and stuff ,
45156	1	a	so if they already have it as as a chip then we we could use it .
45157	0	a	Yeah .
45158	1	a	Okay maybe we can just listen to this presentation and then take decision later on according to those news .
45159	0	a	Okay .
45160	0	a	Yeah
45161	0	a	but I think it is yeah
45162	0	a	Sorry ,
45163	0	a	I have not written my personal references .
45164	0	a	the I I just want to mention the the problem of the the r wheels sensor which is much more expensive than any push button ,
45165	1	a	and if we could reduce that .
45166	0	a	Okay .
45167	0	a	We we have already some good things with with the backlight of the push button .
45168	1	a	I have a question about that actually .
45169	0	a	, what is the purpose of the light ?
45170	0	a	Is But
45171	0	a	But in th in the dark
45172	0	a	Yeah but is going to be always turned on , the light ?
45173	0	a	But if you move it then you have it , you do not need to find it .
45174	0	a	Just to to make something which is slightly more design that a squarey box with a rubber
45175	0	a	Yeah .
45176	0	a	You can easily find the button in the dark or so ?
45177	0	a	It will be turned on when the when the user move the remote control I think ,
45178	0	a	no ?
45179	0	a	You can see the buttons better , of course .
45180	0	a	Yeah .
45181	0	a	Yeah .
45182	0	a	Yeah .
45183	0	a	Yeah .
45184	0	a	True .
45185	0	a	Actually .
45186	0	a	But if you move it then you have to have some sensor to when you move it to detect your movement .
45187	0	a	As soon as you thought to move the the remote control you have the light .
45188	0	a	Yeah ,
45189	0	a	but you need another sensor for that , right ?
45190	0	a	Yeah
45191	0	a	no it is too expensive .
45192	0	a	Yeah .
45193	0	a	Again .
45194	0	a	I do not think that this is really expensive , but at the end this is plenty of unexpen eh very cheap devices but the bill starts to be First of all I was thinking to have a a continuous light and you w when t you you you you press the on button
45195	0	a	you have the light on your remote control , when you want to turn off your device
45196	0	a	Yeah , a little bit .
45197	0	a	Okay .
45198	0	a	Extra .
45199	0	a	Yeah , okay .
45200	0	a	Yeah ,
45201	0	a	but I expected also the wheel would be cheap but
45202	0	a	you tell me that it is very expensive so ,
45203	0	a	yeah .
45204	0	a	But it can be battery consuming , no ?
45205	0	a	To have the light always on ?
45206	1	a	Well we will discuss that after maybe the other presentations .
45207	0	a	A little bit .
45208	0	a	Yeah .
45209	0	a	Okay
45210	0	a	So my one , it should be in the shared folder .
45211	0	a	Yeah .
45212	0	a	So .
45213	0	a	It was last time I saw it .
45214	0	a	And it is .
45215	0	a	Okay .
45216	0	a	So ,
45217	1	a	just move to the next slide .
45218	0	a	Okay .
45219	0	a	So basically want very simple , right ?
45220	0	a	That is the major idea , as simple as possible .
45221	0	a	Yeah .
45222	0	a	Yeah .
45223	0	a	So I just look at some current designs on the web , of usually more complicated remote controls .
45224	1	a	And let is look at two of them because th even though they have many buttons
45225	1	a	they look quite simple .
45226	1	a	And in our case we just reject the buttons what we do not need
45227	1	a	and it become even simpler .
45228	0	a	Yeah .
45229	0	a	So .
45230	0	a	And also does it fit well in hand ?
45231	0	a	Because it was th your wrist problem with the usage .
45232	0	a	Yeah .
45233	0	a	Well this these these remotes are quite big ,
45234	1	a	so go to the next page ,
45235	0	a	so .
45236	0	a	We have all these buttons as you can see , but most of them , we just need the ones in the middle .
45237	0	a	Yeah .
45238	0	a	Yeah .
45239	0	a	Yeah .
45240	0	a	So , from the bottom or whatever is there , the the numbers and then the top , until the ten also , this middle part , and on the left one is exactly the same .
45241	0	a	Yeah .
45242	0	a	Yeah .
45243	0	a	So it is basically more or less how we would like it , with a big volume control , big channel control , and mute and power ,
45244	0	a	yeah ?
45245	0	a	These are the basic thing .
45246	0	a	Yeah .
45247	0	a	So it is only the central part .
45248	1	a	So basically , w software we will build will look more or less the same as these two .
45249	0	a	Yeah .
45250	1	a	With a maybe a more ergonomic design on on the bottom part .
45251	0	a	Yeah ,
45252	0	a	if you have , for example
45253	0	a	I think that the volume and the buttons that are there on the top are not very easy to reach with your thumb .
45254	1	a	It could be on the right side , for example .
45255	0	a	Yeah .
45256	0	a	Okay .
45257	0	a	Yeah .
45258	0	a	Because we do not have these input buttons and this other stuff that they have .
45259	0	a	And I think that the plastic cover is not very good idea because you open it
45260	0	a	, it can break , you ca you can do various things .
45261	0	a	Okay .
45262	1	a	you just need to put the channel numbers somewhere a bit out of the way .
45263	0	a	Okay .
45264	0	a	S
45265	0	a	Okay .
45266	0	a	So that they are separate a bit ,
45267	0	a	yeah .
45268	0	a	Will be down or
45269	0	a	Okay .
45270	0	a	and it is easy to press the other the big buttons , but , it is not that difficult to press the the channel buttons either .
45271	0	a	Yeah , I think that if you put the cover it will be even more difficult for the user .
45272	0	a	Okay .
45273	0	a	Alright , you wo not
45274	0	a	yeah .
45275	0	a	Usually what I have noticed that people put the plastic cover on things that you normally do not mess with , like buttons for t tuning the channels and stuff like that .
45276	0	a	Okay .
45277	0	a	Yeah .
45278	0	a	That you want to protect a bit .
45279	0	a	And I think it is it is reasonable .
45280	0	a	Okay .
45281	0	a	So , I do not think
45282	0	a	Yeah , this is just the the wheel .
45283	0	a	We could use the
45284	0	a	some wheels can be pushed down , could use the push down of the wheel for the record if we want .
45285	1	a	so we could just basically use one just wheel
45286	0	a	and user could use just the wheel to do everything with the channels in that case .
45287	0	a	Yeah .
45288	0	a	Maybe the wheel will be a good advantage over our competitors .
45289	0	a	Because otherwise it is pretty standard apart the fact that it is very simple .
45290	0	a	So maybe it is worse to to have more expense on that is that aspect .
45291	0	a	To s
45292	0	a	Yeah ,
45293	0	a	I guess the market researcher will tell us all about that .
45294	0	a	Okay .
45295	0	a	So we can move to the
45296	0	a	Is there any question ?
45297	0	a	For designer of user interface ?
45298	1	a	or we can move to the next part , maybe , and discuss afterwards ?
45299	0	a	Okay .
45300	0	a	Okay , I can go ?
45301	0	a	Can I ?
45302	0	a	So now the recent investigation we we have done fo of the remote control .
45303	0	a	Yeah .
45304	0	a	So , the most important aspect for remote controls is to be fancy look and feel and not current functional look and feel .
45305	0	a	And the second aspect is that the remote control should be technological innovative .
45306	0	a	Okay .
45307	0	a	And the third most important aspect is to to is that the co remote control should be easy to use .
45308	0	a	So , are things we are we have speak about before .
45309	0	a	Yeah .
45310	0	a	Yeah .
45311	1	a	And so you you can go after .
45312	0	a	Yeah .
45313	0	a	And there is a fashion watchers in Paris and Milan that have detected the following trends , fruits and vegetables will be the most important theme for clothes , shoes , and furnitures .
45314	1	a	So , maybe if our remote control have to be a fruit form or vegetable form something like that , or
45315	0	a	And the the material is expected to be spongy .
45316	0	a	Okay .
45317	1	a	I support an apple .
45318	0	a	I do not know which material can be spongy ,
45319	0	a	and if you
45320	0	a	Yeah .
45321	0	a	This is good also for
45322	0	a	Yeah .
45323	0	a	Well , wou wou
45324	0	a	I think we can certainly just put the electronics in a spongy thing ,
45325	0	a	it it would work , right ?
45326	0	a	Yeah .
45327	0	a	Yeah .
45328	0	a	Yeah .
45329	0	a	I think it is good also f to have a spongy material ,
45330	0	a	yeah .
45331	0	a	You can throw it to the television .
45332	0	a	Yeah , because it is robust .
45333	0	a	Okay
45334	0	a	It is robust , yeah .
45335	0	a	Yeah .
45336	0	a	Me too .
45337	0	a	Hey
45338	0	a	that is a cool one .
45339	1	a	We could say that if you throw it , you have a sensor , and you throw it and hits the television and turns it off .
45340	0	a	When it d takes a shock .
45341	0	a	Yeah
45342	0	a	sorry ?
45343	0	a	No .
45344	0	a	it is okay .
45345	0	a	Not good .
45346	0	a	I know that they do that for alarm clock also .
45347	0	a	An and and this you can
45348	1	a	yeah you can say that .
45349	0	a	Yeah .
45350	1	a	You ca you can go before
45351	0	a	, before , yes .
45352	0	a	Yeah .
45353	0	a	Before ?
45354	0	a	Yeah .
45355	0	a	And you know here the more iz important aspect is the fancy look and feel , after is technological innovative , and after the easy to use .
45356	0	a	Yeah .
45357	0	a	Yeah .
45358	0	a	I think it is innovative to use the the wheel because I think no one else has .
45359	0	a	Yeah .
45360	0	a	Yeah that is why
45361	0	a	Yeah
45362	1	a	that is why I think we have to keep that if it is possible .
45363	0	a	Has it ?
45364	0	a	Yeah .
45365	0	a	I think it is it makes it both easy and both innos innovative .
45366	0	a	Innovative .
45367	0	a	So I think it is a good aspect and it should be kept .
45368	1	a	How do we make it look cool is the question .
45369	0	a	Cool , fancy ?
45370	0	a	We have to make it
45371	0	a	l look like a fruit or vegetable .
45372	0	a	Yeah .
45373	0	a	Yeah .
45374	1	a	Maybe a colour that remember some fruit , things like that .
45375	0	a	What about
45376	1	a	And for maybe look and feel , what about a a piece of ice , with blue LED inside ?
45377	0	a	Yeah .
45378	0	a	Oh , colour , yeah .
45379	0	a	Well the obvious thing is a banana , I guess .
45380	0	a	Oh i
45381	0	a	i
45382	0	a	I thought about a a pear , for example .
45383	0	a	Maybe yeah .
45384	0	a	You know the pear , is like that and it is it is easy to to have in in hand
45385	0	a	and
45386	0	a	Yeah .
45387	0	a	Yeah ,
45388	0	a	and it is ergonomic as well .
45389	0	a	A pear .
45390	0	a	The banana is also ergonomic .
45391	1	a	Yeah .
45392	1	a	Maybe pear yeah or something like that .
45393	1	a	Or a fruit like that .
45394	0	a	I dunno .
45395	0	a	Yeah .
45396	1	a	We can discuss that .
45397	0	a	D D Is is there anything you want to add ?
45398	0	a	I do not think so .
45399	0	a	Is there any fruit that is spongy ?
45400	0	a	Yeah .
45401	1	a	I think we we can have like
45402	1	a	yeah
45403	1	a	a pear is good , fit well , or banana as you told .
45404	1	a	Something like that .
45405	0	a	But that is not in the trend .
45406	0	a	You can make it
45407	0	a	It is not hard , the metal .
45408	0	a	The trend is spongy , and vegetable fruits .
45409	0	a	Yeah .
45410	0	a	Yeah .
45411	0	a	I think p spongy is good because it it will be robust as well .
45412	0	a	Plastic .
45413	0	a	Yep .
45414	0	a	So ,
45415	1	a	I think we can keep the wheel
45416	0	a	because it is easy , it is innovative , even if the cost is a bit higher , and we also have to find a , so , a fruit like pear or banana
45417	1	a	wit any others idea you have .
45418	0	a	Yeah .
45419	1	a	What kind of fr fruit would you like to to control your TV with ?
45420	0	a	Odi
45421	0	a	Banana is also yellow so you you ca not lost your remote control then .
45422	1	a	Banana I think ,
45423	0	a	it is a nice idea .
45424	0	a	Because But
45425	1	a	You y you do not use the banana when the banana is curving like that , but when the banana is curving like that , with the wheel on the top and to control , and here you have a a push button to
45426	0	a	Yeah .
45427	0	a	Yeah .
45428	0	a	Yeah .
45429	1	a	Two of the button ,
45430	0	a	yeah .
45431	0	a	Yeah .
45432	0	a	Yeah .
45433	0	a	But you do not have
45434	0	a	I think it is a good idea ,
45435	0	a	yeah .
45436	1	a	Yeah so you can just have just have this curve ,
45437	0	a	yeah ,
45438	0	a	and you move your hand here to press the buttons
45439	0	a	and then you move on the other side .
45440	0	a	Yeah .
45441	0	a	So you can have it on on two sides
45442	0	a	and it will be cool ,
45443	0	a	no ?
45444	1	a	You can put also vibrator inside .
45445	0	a	Yeah .
45446	0	a	I think it is a good design and it is innovative as well then .
45447	1	a	Maybe we can keep the banana .
45448	0	a	And it will be very easy to find .
45449	0	a	And everybody knows what is a banana .
45450	0	a	Basically .
45451	0	a	If you if you start with fancy fruits and fra s and tha
45452	0	a	Oh , yeah
45453	0	a	So
45454	0	a	So we will just use a a standard battery ?
45455	0	a	And the chip
45456	0	a	we
45457	0	a	chip imprint we know exactly which one we are going to use .
45458	0	a	Ah ha .
45459	0	a	You can also take into account the fact that the banana fits with the colour scheme of our company .
45460	0	a	Yeah .
45461	0	a	Yeah .
45462	0	a	Yeah it is really really a good point .
45463	0	a	I hope the students of management die ,
45464	0	a	but anyway .
45465	0	a	Now who are recording this meeting ?
45466	0	a	The only th
45467	0	a	Yeah .
45468	0	a	I think it
45469	0	a	So One second .
45470	0	a	So we have to take some decision on this aspect .
45471	0	a	So , so for
45472	0	a	sorry ,
45473	0	a	for component ,
45474	0	a	so
45475	0	a	we have to think about those aspects ,
45476	0	a	sorry .
45477	0	a	Yeah .
45478	0	a	what do you mean by case ?
45479	0	a	Yeah .
45480	0	a	I think it is the box that should be spongy , banana is shape .
45481	0	a	I mean for me if we use a a spongy banana case , does not matter .
45482	0	a	I just want to have so something to prin to to fix my my components onto that box , and that is it .
45483	0	a	Y Yeah that can be in inside th in the structure .
45484	0	a	Yeah yeah .
45485	0	a	Yeah .
45486	0	a	But the thing is that the buttons and the wheel have to be
45487	0	a	I mean if it is spongy then the buttons and the wheel have to
45488	0	a	I mean if it is spongy then it is going to move ,
45489	0	a	right ?
45490	0	a	So , it is going to be bend a lot .
45491	0	a	Spongy also .
45492	0	a	So if we try to push the buttons , it
45493	0	a	You think it is possible ?
45494	0	a	Okay .
45495	0	a	Oh no I think it is possible .
45496	0	a	But No the button would be
45497	1	a	In fact it it should be something odd shaped , with a spongy cover .
45498	0	a	Yeah .
45499	0	a	Yeah
45500	0	a	This is like the
45501	0	a	Yeah .
45502	0	a	Okay
45503	0	a	odd shape with spongy cover .
45504	0	a	And standard battery okay , a chip imprint , there is no specific problem .
45505	0	a	So we agree to put the wheel
45506	0	a	So it have to
45507	0	a	it has to be symmetrical .
45508	0	a	Wheel on the top .
45509	1	a	Button , where do we want some buttons ?
45510	0	a	Yeah .
45511	0	a	Well ,
45512	0	a	usually hold
45513	0	a	Kay , we want it to be good also for the left hand users ,
45514	0	a	right ?
45515	0	a	Yeah
45516	0	a	but
45517	0	a	okay .
45518	0	a	Sa let is say that th o It has to be
45519	0	a	basically you can only take two sides , one on ths this side where is the thumb and the other side where there is yeah also the thumb .
45520	0	a	Yep .
45521	0	a	Yep .
45522	0	a	Basically .
45523	0	a	Or you could use use this one ,
45524	0	a	but I do not know if it is very comfortable , to use this one for the wheel .
45525	0	a	Yeah maybe the thumb is more comfortable .
45526	1	a	This for the wheel
45527	1	a	and then this for the buttons ?
45528	0	a	Should have the two sides .
45529	0	a	Yeah I think it is okay for both right and left .
45530	0	a	So if the left , we have the op
45531	0	a	Wheel
45532	0	a	Wheel buttons .
45533	0	a	I think you can turn it this way also .
45534	0	a	You can do both with both hands .
45535	0	a	Yeah , the problem is if you have buttons and wheel then when you turn it around , the buttons are on the other side .
45536	0	a	I think it is okay .
45537	0	a	So you cannot see them .
45538	0	a	Well , you you will get used to it .
45539	0	a	Yeah .
45540	0	a	And moreover , th the button ar are lighted so you you immediately identify the right side , because you have light on buttons .
45541	0	a	So the buttons have to be here and the wheel has to be
45542	0	a	Y
45543	0	a	Yeah I know ,
45544	0	a	but if you hold with your left hand , and the wheel is here , and the buttons are here , then when you turn it around the buttons will be on the other side .
45545	0	a	Yeah .
45546	0	a	No
45547	0	a	you you
45548	0	a	I think you will use it only on the right or left hand , whether you are righty or lefty .
45549	0	a	I think for lefty it is okay .
45550	0	a	I can do this movement ,
45551	0	a	and for righty as well .
45552	0	a	I think this does not change that much .
45553	0	a	Okay .
45554	0	a	Yeah ?
45555	0	a	So ,
45556	0	a	for interface we said also that we have this banana shape with button on the s on the side .
45557	0	a	Okay .
45558	0	a	Maybe .
45559	0	a	Yeah .
45560	0	a	And
45561	0	a	and a wheel on the top .
45562	0	a	Yeah .
45563	0	a	So the colour is yellow .
45564	0	a	I think it is
45565	0	a	we defined everything according to what we should what the decision we should take , yeah .
45566	0	a	So maybe we can
45567	1	a	we can work on those aspects until next meeting .
45568	1	a	So have the final look and feel design according to the decision .
45569	1	a	And have the the user interface design and then evaluate the prodyuc the product .
45570	0	a	That is to say , check if it fit the the requirement given by the users ,
45571	0	a	but according to your presentation it seems to be okay .
45572	0	a	It seems to be fancy , innovative , and easy to use .
45573	0	a	So so
45574	1	a	to prepare the prototype I would suggest that the Industrial Designer and the User Interface Designer work together .
45575	0	a	That would be better , I think .
45576	0	a	Yeah .
45577	0	a	And And so
45578	0	a	you will receive further instruction by emails , as usual .
45579	0	a	So
45580	1	a	do you need to add anything ?
45581	0	a	You feel okay ?
45582	0	a	You feel free to express what you want to say ?
45583	0	a	You do not feel too constrained ?
45584	0	a	You do not feel free to answer this ?
45585	0	a	Okay , so
45586	0	a	Yes master .
45587	0	a	No .
45588	0	a	Yeah .
45589	0	a	Yeah .
45590	0	a	No .
45591	0	a	Maybe you can make
45592	0	a	 
45593	0	a	Okay .
45594	0	a	Je croix que c'est dommage de le
45595	0	a	it will be sad to destroy this prototype .
45596	0	a	It really looks like a banana .
45597	0	a	It is a banana .
45598	0	a	It is a banana .
45599	0	a	It is the essence of bananas .
45600	0	a	I would be confused with this thing .
45601	0	a	S
45602	0	a	How is everyone ?
45603	0	a	Okay .
45604	0	a	Hi .
45605	0	a	Hi .
45606	0	a	So we are here for the detailed design meeting .
45607	0	a	So
45608	0	a	we will
45609	0	a	I will first present what we are going to do in this meeting .
45610	0	a	Then I have
45611	0	a	I will also take notes during this meeting and I will send you a summary then as usual .
45612	0	a	We will then look at the evaluation criteria of the prototype presented by our two colleagues
45613	0	a	that make good work .
45614	0	a	And then we will see the financial aspects and the cost of the product .
45615	0	a	Then we will evaluate the product .
45616	0	a	And end with the conclusion of this project and see whether it fits with it fulf if it fulfil the requirement or not .
45617	0	a	So
45618	0	a	d
45619	1	a	let is start with the cost aspect
45620	0	a	so so
45621	0	a	I look at the aspect discussed last time , that is to say to have a standard battery , to have a yellow banana shaped case with a rubber material around it
45622	0	a	to be
45623	0	a	to feel spongy , and also at the different aspect like having a wheel etcetera .
45624	0	a	Like a banana .
45625	0	a	And the cost ended to be ten point seven Euros .
45626	0	a	So
45627	0	a	which is good ,
45628	0	a	because we had a price gap of twelve point five Euros .
45629	0	a	So
45630	0	a	for the financial aspect it is okay ,
45631	0	a	we can we can continue with this product as if ,
45632	1	a	and we are now going to see the project evaluation with our marketing expert .
45633	0	a	Yeah .
45634	0	a	Okay .
45635	0	a	So
45636	1	a	you can have my project in
45637	0	a	yeah
45638	0	a	just a
45639	0	a	Four .
45640	0	a	Yeah .
45641	0	a	You have a presentation ?
45642	0	a	Participant four , yes .
45643	0	a	Evaluation .
45644	0	a	Okay .
45645	0	a	Okay .
45646	0	a	Okay .
45647	1	a	So you can go .
45648	1	a	We can go through .
45649	0	a	Okay .
45650	0	a	So
45651	0	a	I made an evaluation and the the evaluation criteria is made according to the users' requirements and the market trends we talked about during the previous meetings .

45716	0	a	So
45717	0	a	this is your
45718	0	a	One is most .
45719	0	a	I

45727	0	a	seven is the best .
45728	0	a	Okay .
45729	0	a	So so
45730	0	a	do note the grade we have five , six for me ,
45731	0	a	five .
45732	0	a	Five .
45733	0	a	And what what is your choice ?
45734	0	a	How much would you give on the fancy aspect , on the fashionable aspect ?
45735	0	a	How much would you

45753	0	a	Okay .
45754	0	a	So
45755	0	a	after , the technological aspect ?
45756	0	a	So
45757	0	a	we we said we have a new technological thing with a wheel .
45758	0	a	Yeah , we have the wheel .
45759	0	a	We also have the rubber material , which make it like new also .
45760	0	a	I think I would give a five .
45761	0	a	It is four .
45762	0	a	Four ?
45763	0	a	Okay .
45764	0	a	A four also ,
45765	0	a	because , except for the wheel , we do not have so much innovation .
45766	0	a	Yeah .
45767	0	a	The rubber is a four .
45768	0	a	D are we including the voice are you glu
45769	0	a	are we including the voice in the end or not ?
45770	0	a	Huh ?
45771	0	a	No .

45780	0	a	Yeah , four .
45781	0	a	No .

45785	0	a	or four poin
45786	0	a	Four .
45787	0	a	Yeah .
45788	0	a	For twenty five .
45789	0	a	Four , yeah , let is put four .
45790	0	a	Yeah .
45791	0	a	Okay .
45792	0	a	Does not it
45793	0	a	Yeah , I think so .
45794	0	a	Very easy to use .
45795	0	a	Do you think it is easy to use ?
45796	0	a	, six for me also .
45797	0	a	I give a seven , I think .
45798	0	a	Yeah .
45799	0	a	Six .
45800	0	a	I would give a I would give a seven as well .
45801	0	a	It is very easy to use .
45802	0	a	Six .
45803	0	a	So
45804	0	a	six point five .
45805	0	a	Six point five .
45806	0	a	Kay .
45807	0	a	Six six six point five .
45808	0	a	Okay .
45809	0	a	Okay .
45810	0	a	Is it fashion ?
45811	0	a	Seven ?
45812	0	a	Yeah it is fashion ,
45813	0	a	because it is a fruit ,
45814	0	a	and we say that the
45815	0	a	yeah , seven .
45816	0	a	Oh yeah ,
45817	0	a	its its f its fruit fruit shape .
45818	0	a	I would say seven .
45819	0	a	And is very very nice design .
45820	0	a	Yeah , we can we can put a seven here .
45821	0	a	Yeah .
45822	0	a	Yeah , seven .
45823	0	a	Yeah .
45824	0	a	Yeah .
45825	0	a	Seven , okay .
45826	0	a	Well ,
45827	0	a	we hope .
45828	0	a	Easy to find .
45829	0	a	easy to find in a room ?
45830	0	a	Yeah ?
45831	0	a	We have the lightning ,
45832	0	a	or
45833	0	a	The lighting .
45834	0	a	I lost my banana .
45835	0	a	I think you ca not miss it .
45836	0	a	Yeah .
45837	0	a	Okay .
45838	0	a	Yeah , I think it is cool .
45839	0	a	I think we can put a six here .
45840	0	a	Yeah ,
45841	0	a	we have the
45842	0	a	we do not sesh especially have the lightning
45843	0	a	but
45844	0	a	So
45845	0	a	it is yellow .
45846	0	a	So you will make the material transparent
45847	0	a	so that it lights up completely ,
45848	0	a	or
45849	0	a	Yeah .
45850	0	a	It is okay .
45851	0	a	I think it is very easy to I would say seven .
45852	0	a	Yeah .
45853	0	a	Seven ?
45854	0	a	Is it is it robust ?
45855	0	a	Everybody is okay , six .
45856	0	a	It is hard to miss it .
45857	0	a	Six .
45858	0	a	Yeah , okay .
45859	0	a	Yeah ,
45860	0	a	it is rubber , made of rubber , I think it is m
45861	0	a	it is more rubber than other remote control .
45862	0	a	f
45863	0	a	yeah ,
45864	0	a	it is ru it is rubber .
45865	0	a	Yeah .
45866	0	a	Yeah the only problem there might be which know ,
45867	0	a	i if it is very sensitive ,
45868	0	a	they will ,
45869	0	a	I do not know
45870	0	a	Yeah , okay .
45871	0	a	Yeah .
45872	0	a	Yeah .
45873	0	a	But it is it is surrounded by rubber material .
45874	0	a	Yeah .
45875	0	a	So maybe we can put a six .
45876	0	a	Yeah .
45877	0	a	Six or five .
45878	0	a	Six is okay ?
45879	0	a	Yeah .
45880	0	a	Six , yeah , for me .
45881	0	a	Five Six .
45882	0	a	Yeah .
45883	0	a	Okay .
45884	0	a	Yeah .
45885	0	a	S
45886	0	a	now so .
45887	0	a	Tadada .
45888	1	a	We have to sum up everything .
45889	0	a	Twenty .
45890	0	a	Thirteen , twenty , twenty six point five , seven , thirty two , thirty six .
45891	0	a	Thirty .
45892	0	a	Thir
45893	0	a	Okay .
45894	0	a	That is that is okay ?
45895	0	a	Six .
45896	0	a	Six is a good
45897	0	a	Yeah ,
45898	0	a	the be .
45899	0	a	Good .
45900	0	a	if we say that seven it is it is the better ,
45901	0	a	and when s six sit six are good
45902	0	a	it is a good p product , I think .
45903	0	a	Yeah , the top
45904	0	a	Okay , so
45905	0	a	six is a
45906	0	a	So it is a good evaluation , I think .
45907	0	a	So will become eight soon ?
45908	0	a	Yeah , well
45909	0	a	it is a bit biased .
45910	0	a	It is very promising .
45911	0	a	We have a good price
45912	0	a	and .
45913	0	a	Huh .
45914	0	a	Yeah .
45915	0	a	Okay .
45916	0	a	Good .
45917	0	a	So this prototype is quite nice .
45918	0	a	Because I saw some phones that were banana shaped , wireless phones not mobile ones , wireless for the house , quite big also , and they were selling something like a hundred Euros , two hundred Euros .
45919	0	a	Yeah .
45920	0	a	Okay .
45921	0	a	Just a just a phone , wireless .
45922	0	a	So having this at twenty five Euros is quite attractive , I think .
45923	0	a	Yeah .
45924	0	a	I think the
45925	0	a	Yeah .
45926	0	a	But almo also the complexity between a phone and a remote control is not cannot compare .
45927	0	a	Yeah .
45928	0	a	Yeah ,
45929	0	a	it is much more complex ,
45930	0	a	but
45931	0	a	Okay .
45932	0	a	So ,
45933	1	a	I think , we can summarise .
45934	0	a	So
45935	0	a	we have seen the prototype .
45936	0	a	It is very nice according to the work of our two designer .
45937	0	a	The the the financial aspect were okay .
45938	0	a	We we have the cost below our threshold
45939	0	a	and so we could sell at twenty five Euros and make i make profit .
45940	0	a	The the evaluation give satisfying result as well .
45941	1	a	So I think we can move to the last part of the meeting .
45942	0	a	So
45943	0	a	the cost is in the budget , the evaluation is okay ,
45944	1	a	so I th I think we can now open champagne and make a huge party .
45945	0	a	Start to eat banana .
45946	0	a	I do not know if it is provided by by the meeting staff .
45947	0	a	Okay so
45948	0	a	congratulation .
45949	0	a	Yeah .
45950	0	a	Congratulations to the team .
45951	0	a	Nice product .
45952	0	a	very well , we worked together fantastically .
45953	0	a	Yeah .
45954	0	a	I think it was a good collaboration .
45955	0	a	Aspect .
45956	0	a	So
45957	0	a	what does the management say ?
45958	0	a	What does the management say ?
45959	0	a	Sorry ?
45960	0	a	I think we will have much bigger project next time and a much bigger salary as well .
45961	0	a	All it depends on who watch this meeting .
45962	0	a	Yeah .
45963	0	a	We do not know .
45964	0	a	Yeah .
45965	0	a	Okay , so
45966	0	a	good guys ,
45967	0	a	Okay .
45968	0	a	Okay .
45969	0	a	Yeah .
45970	0	a	 
45971	0	a	So
45972	0	a	we are here to talk about functional design .
45973	0	a	Now hopefully we have all got a better idea from than we did f leaving the last meeting as to what it is we are up to now .
45974	1	a	So here is an agenda .
45975	0	a	I will open .
45976	1	a	you should know that I will be taking minutes during all the meetings ,
45977	0	a	as I was struggling to our last time and that will be easier for me now because I am not actually giving the whole presentation .
45978	0	a	the additional points are just the stuff that we sent and that I forwarded on from upper management having a few bright ideas to make our lives painful .
45979	0	a	now you can all give your presentations .
45980	0	a	We can talk about the requirements and hopefully come to some decisions .
45981	0	a	Right , forty minutes for this meeting , so a bit more time than the last one .
45982	0	a	Here is the additional points
45983	0	a	I just wanted to put those in there to see if you guys had any comments on them .
45984	0	a	did you all receive that email ?
45985	1	a	So does anyone have any overall
45986	0	a	Yep .
45987	0	a	Yeah .
45988	0	a	Well what comes up for me is that if we are going to if we are going to be marketing a product that is going to be having no teletext , people are very comfortable with the idea of having teletext and using teletext , and so we are not we are going to be a new product without something that people are very comfortable having right now .
45989	0	a	Yep .
45990	0	a	So that is , from a marketing perspective I
45991	0	a	I see I see a lack .
45992	0	a	And so we have to go , I think , in the other direction .
45993	1	a	What are we going to have that makes this thing better than
45994	0	a	Right .
45995	0	a	Well tha that first point could also be an op opportunity because in seeing that teletext is becoming outdated , some sort remote control that can work with the Internet there is the opportunity that is presented , I guess .
45996	0	a	Yeah .
45997	0	a	No , I I agree with you .
45998	0	a	So what I am talking about is I see that one side we are eliminating something so we have to come up with another side which is , what are we going to be targeting our market that identifies our product as better than
45999	0	a	because it does not have teletext
46000	0	a	it has ta ta ta
46001	0	a	ta ta .
46002	0	a	Okay .
46003	0	a	So that is that is that was my reactions .
46004	0	a	Okay .
46005	0	a	Yeah .
46006	0	a	but but we are sort of being dictated that this should only be for the television .
46007	0	a	Yeah yeah .
46008	0	a	So we are quite fixed .
46009	0	a	Yep .
46010	0	a	So we are really probably , in terms of marketing , are looking for that
46011	0	a	is that is a cost winner rather than a fantastic new feature product .
46012	0	a	Okay .
46013	0	a	Yeah bu but we we are designing only the remote
46014	0	a	, we not design the TV .
46015	0	a	Yeah .
46016	0	a	So we are going to be removing the teletext out of any TV that we people use our remote with .
46017	0	a	Yeah .
46018	0	a	Kay .
46019	0	a	That is right .
46020	0	a	I think we take with you .
46021	0	a	So it is kind of a stupid decision .
46022	0	a	But there is also the potential for mark there is a market here for our lost teletext .
46023	0	a	Right .
46024	0	a	For example someone that just goes to the shop that wants a replacement wants it as cheap as possible .
46025	0	a	Twenty five Euros is the selling price , we really have to innovate here I guess .
46026	0	a	That is what I am that is what I am talking about is is that we have to find something that is going to be very attractive about this product cause somebody , some people are going to be hap unhappy cause it took they ca not ac access their teletext .
46027	0	a	Okay .
46028	0	a	Cause we are talking about eighty percent or ninety percent or ninety five percent of the televisions out there are are teletext .
46029	0	a	K yeah .
46030	0	a	So so it is it is not that I am criticizing the product at all .
46031	0	a	It is just when we eliminate that then what do we bring ?
46032	0	a	What are we bringing in to take the place of this ,
46033	1	a	and we have to d in my opinion we have to double up .
46034	0	a	kay .
46035	1	a	If we lose one we need to bring two or three .
46036	0	a	Okay .
46037	0	a	Okay
46038	0	a	I think that the last point is probably quite straightforward .
46039	0	a	Obviously the the w it has to be branded .
46040	0	a	So then the double R will be our our
46041	0	a	I tho I tho I thou
46042	0	a	I think Rol Ro Rolls Royce might mind , but do not worry .
46043	0	a	Kay .
46044	0	a	On the product
46045	0	a	yeah .
46046	0	a	I think one of
46047	0	a	I think w , yeah , one of the things that we should also keep in mind when we are doing this
46048	0	a	I mean our company is slogan is we put the fashion in electronics , right .
46049	0	a	Can you handle that black and yellow ?
46050	0	a	So I think our kind of our target here is to have some kind of very like sleek nice look remote
46051	0	a	and we want it to be functional as well ,
46052	0	a	but I think one of the main selling points is that we do not want it to be clunky like like this thing here .
46053	0	a	You know we do not want to a big clunker .
46054	0	a	We want something that looks nice and it is fashionable and so
46055	0	a	That is fine .
46056	0	a	So you have this ?
46057	0	a	Now is would this be considered just a standard
46058	0	a	This is not this is not cutting edge technology we are talking here .
46059	0	a	Nah .
46060	0	a	So we have three presentations ,
46061	1	a	and I think we will go in order of participant number here .
46062	1	a	So we can have a look at the working design first from participant two .
46063	0	a	That is
46064	0	a	Okay .
46065	0	a	Yes .
46066	0	a	Okay so
46067	0	a	so you all know me , I am the Industrial Designer .
46068	0	a	it is enough .
46069	0	a	But click it on off ?
46070	0	a	Do we have an idea of costs of different components ?
46071	0	a	Kay .
46072	0	a	And we have some basic components that our remote is going to need , just basically every remote will need them .
46073	0	a	We need some kind of of power d power source .
46074	0	a	we have to decide on our our user interface , which is his department , but
46075	0	a	the in user interface is also a major component .
46076	0	a	we need a programmable digital signal processor to to take the input from the user and translate that into into electronic signal , which we pass to the infra red LED , which you aim at the television
46077	0	a	which and it receives that signal .
46078	0	a	You need a on off switch
46079	0	a	I do not know how that got in there .
46080	0	a	And we also need to have the if we want a universal remote we need to have encryption codes for the different makes of TVs .
46081	0	a	So we need to know all the different you know all the different signals and so that will require some memory as well .
46082	0	a	so here is just a basic layout of how how the remote would work .
46083	0	a	You ha the v the power source is in the upper right hand corner there , and you can see that we have the user interface here which is connected to the chip which does all our signal processing , and then passes that signal on to the infra red LED and that signal is then emitted and received by the television at the photo transistor .
46084	0	a	So those are the basic components that need to go into this and everything else is pretty much open to move around .
46085	0	a	I think any des
46086	0	a	No .
46087	0	a	We are talking about existing technology .
46088	0	a	Right
46089	0	a	I think
46090	0	a	Yeah
46091	0	a	this is just this is just a basic layout of ev of all the components that w w are going to be absolutely necessary f to have a working remote .
46092	0	a	Nothing is being modified or upgraded or new discoveries .
46093	1	a	We can add things in like if we wanted some voice recognition ,
46094	0	a	I mean that I mean that you can kind of say would would fall under the user interface and the digital signal processing chip .
46095	0	a	Okay .
46096	0	a	Okay .
46097	0	a	well the most the most costly components are going to be the chip
46098	0	a	and the th it could als
46099	0	a	basically the user interface and the casing are going to be expensive as well .
46100	0	a	the LED and the the transistors and everything else are you know they are
46101	0	a	they are pretty cheap .
46102	0	a	So depending on what we want our functionality to be , the chip could be expensive or it could be cheap .
46103	0	a	depending on the n amount of memory we need in there and stuff like that and h and h you know how much power .
46104	0	a	kay .
46105	0	a	Do we have any ballpark figures for that yet ?
46106	0	a	No .
46107	0	a	I do not have any figures right now .
46108	0	a	Kay .
46109	0	a	We we have to wait until we get to a more specific design phase for that .
46110	0	a	Yeah .
46111	0	a	N okay .
46112	0	a	but and I think a significant part of the cost could be the actual the actual casing itself and
46113	0	a	and you know the the b the buttons and things like that , I think .
46114	0	a	the shell ?
46115	0	a	Okay .
46116	0	a	Yeah .
46117	0	a	Basically yeah .
46118	0	a	Okay .
46119	0	a	So yeah .
46120	0	a	That is all I have really .
46121	0	a	Okay .
46122	0	a	Thanks .
46123	0	a	And we have participant three , which I believe is Pedro .
46124	0	a	I
46125	0	a	Hey mouse .
46126	0	a	I can give you that to click on .
46127	0	a	Open .
46128	0	a	And you want to get
46129	1	a	View a slide show , that is what you want to do ,
46130	1	a	yeah ?
46131	1	a	Just go up to view .
46132	0	a	When we are fighting over it is also more lot more fun .
46133	1	a	Click , do not
46134	1	a	Yeah .
46135	0	a	kay
46136	0	a	But I t I think what the the management recommendation was less that there is a worry that teletext will become outdated rather than we should not have it .
46137	0	a	This does not work .
46138	0	a	So yeah function design .
46139	0	a	you guys know me , Pedro , and what I found is we want to do fashion
46140	1	a	and I think , honestly , we should keep technology low and just simple basically and try to aim for design .
46141	0	a	If
46142	0	a	basically a case will will cost the same if it looks good or bad so we ma we have to make it look good .
46143	1	a	something cute and small .
46144	0	a	The big chunky remotes are died in the eighties .
46145	1	a	So we should just go for something that people will like to actually look at .
46146	0	a	And although mo most people will buy s televisions and everything for that have loads of loads of little functions and everything and they mostly end up using simple functions and little things and most the people wo not wo not get too mad of actually having to go the to the s to the television to , for instance , tune in their the stations .
46147	0	a	There is no need to have that in the remote .
46148	0	a	So
46149	1	a	as for what I would recommend for the the interface design , and I will change the colours on the on the logo , but we should go for the user oriented device ,
46150	0	a	so simple controls and good ergonomics .
46151	1	a	and although I th I th I am still here recommending the teletext
46152	1	a	so I will remove that , I guess ,
46153	0	a	but we should go for the
46154	0	a	Yeah .
46155	1	a	So I I still think if it is cheap enough functionality wise to include , it really should be in there .
46156	0	a	Because otherwise we are just going to
46157	0	a	I mean even if it is necessary or not , if you if you are given the choice between a t a remote with teletext or without when it really if it i if it is not more expensive for us to k make because as far as I understand it , it can be operated with the same set of buttons ,
46158	0	a	yeah ?
46159	1	a	So it should be in there .
46160	0	a	Right as far as
46161	0	a	i it is just the cost of an extra button .
46162	0	a	I mean software wise there is really no difference .
46163	0	a	Yeah .
46164	0	a	Okay .
46165	0	a	I think .
46166	0	a	Is not
46167	0	a	Well maybe what we are getting into here is the the idea of Internet through the TV for example .
46168	1	a	I have maybe a silly question .
46169	0	a	I in the very beginning it said with the with the advent of computers there is going to be the it is going to be out moded teletext .
46170	0	a	I I do not understand how those two things are connected .
46171	0	a	How does how does computers and teletext h how why is one eliminating the need of the other ?
46172	0	a	I do not understand that .
46173	1	a	So that might play on what we can do .
46174	0	a	Yeah
46175	0	a	the they are basically aiming at saying that you would use you know a couple of years ago teletext to be the easiest way to check like for the scheduling and the next programme and stuff like that
46176	0	a	and now
46177	0	a	Yeah
46178	0	a	and now you can c look it over Internet .
46179	0	a	Scheduling .
46180	0	a	to find out what what you are watching even if there is commercials you know .
46181	0	a	Okay .
46182	0	a	But I still think teletext is way more convenient until until we have the same commodities .
46183	0	a	I think I ha
46184	0	a	I agree .
46185	0	a	Yeah cause , yeah ,
46186	0	a	I just I do not see the cross over between computers and television .
46187	0	a	I mean I do see the cross over in some sense , but
46188	0	a	but but but with the the remote is is used for television , okay .
46189	0	a	Yeah , but it is not happen yet .
46190	0	a	Well for me
46191	0	a	Yeah .
46192	0	a	Yeah .
46193	0	a	Well you have digital TV still already .
46194	0	a	So so if we make the cross over and we are going to view television on computers then we are then we are losing the the necessity of the remote .
46195	0	a	Unless you have a
46196	0	a	Yeah .
46197	0	a	Well there there is a for example on digital TV systems you have you can press a button
46198	0	a	and you can buy things in adverts , and you can you can view through a catalogue for example .
46199	0	a	S
46200	0	a	Okay .
46201	0	a	A a family member of mine has got a system
46202	0	a	where you just you can
46203	0	a	Yeah , and there is other features for example on other systems where you can pause live TV and things like that .
46204	0	a	They are just features from the Internet from computers are are coming into the TV sort of under the covers , but you still use it through a teletext .
46205	0	a	So now the things to think here are that that there is going to be more functionality , potentially that we can handle .
46206	0	a	Okay .
46207	0	a	Yeah
46208	0	a	but we we do not we are not aiming a command for that .
46209	0	a	That is the thing .
46210	0	a	And all of those require the other commands with more complexity and more software and
46211	0	a	Yeah
46212	0	a	but we would increase the price to try to make it a trainable one , so
46213	0	a	Well I dunno .
46214	0	a	I think a lot of that is proprietary anyways .
46215	0	a	You are not going to be able to , you , like command a TiVo with our remote .
46216	0	a	I do not think .
46217	0	a	But still there there is an opportunity .
46218	1	a	If if it is , for example , a trainable one then we are just simply having like an up , down , left , right , an okay button or something like that might might do as well in future proofing it .
46219	0	a	Okay .
46220	0	a	One way the other teletext was there
46221	1	a	but I guess we can remove it
46222	1	a	or , you know , make two separate interface designs .
46223	1	a	I think if it is possible you should try to you know have a talk with management about that .
46224	1	a	Just you know
46225	0	a	Right it is just not
46226	0	a	Yeah .
46227	0	a	Yeah I do not I do not see the logic .
46228	0	a	Yeah .
46229	0	a	I I do not see the logic in elimination of teletext ,
46230	0	a	I
46231	0	a	just I
46232	0	a	I
46233	0	a	but I am not a tech mind either .
46234	0	a	Yeah .
46235	0	a	Yeah , and neither do I in fact .
46236	0	a	I just do not see the cross over between computers and and and Cause we are designing something for a television , okay .
46237	0	a	Bu .
46238	1	a	I will communicate that back to those guys there
46239	0	a	a a and th the message really we want to be sending to them is that , although teletext may become outdated w there is no l logic in not having it in there anyway
46240	0	a	i if it does not affect the price .
46241	0	a	Yeah .
46242	0	a	We are selling it to an existing market .
46243	0	a	Yeah .
46244	0	a	but I
46245	0	a	I think what they are pushing us towards here is in terms of thinking of ways to future proof our system for future systems that have something else other than teletext maybe .
46246	0	a	Yeah
46247	0	a	but we are not putting some
46248	0	a	there is no
46249	0	a	no putting anything in in the place of teletext .
46250	0	a	I dunno
46251	0	a	I am
46252	0	a	kay .
46253	0	a	That is
46254	0	a	Yeah ,
46255	0	a	and and ,
46256	0	a	yeah ,
46257	0	a	and and we are also marketing a product .
46258	0	a	That is the problem .
46259	0	a	It is what I am seeing is a is a mid range cost product .
46260	0	a	So so w we ca not go and pump a whole bunch of technology into this thing because all of a sudden we are going to have cost overruns .
46261	0	a	Yeah .
46262	1	a	So if we drop if we are going to choose to drop teletext , again what are we adding to the product that makes it marketable ?
46263	0	a	I do not I do not see it ,
46264	0	a	and to me if I am going to market a product for b for beauty for for design I am going to
46265	0	a	I am going to try to market it at a much higher price .
46266	0	a	So if we are keeping it basic we are loo loo what we are looking to sell it basically
46267	0	a	is it is just being very easy to use , looking exceptionally good , that sort of thing .
46268	0	a	Cause we really do not have anything else there , do we ?
46269	0	a	Yeah .
46270	0	a	I need to make it special with a high price tag .
46271	0	a	I do not want to make it economically
46272	0	a	g competitive .
46273	0	a	I want I want to market it as exclusive .
46274	0	a	So I would market this product it at eighty nine Euros and come up with some really beautiful exterior design or something th
46275	0	a	but
46276	0	a	but I do not think we have that flexibility .
46277	0	a	But i if design if design is cheap and functionality is basic , then twenty five Euros is probably a high price for a commoner garden stan standard TV
46278	0	a	so the place remote the
46279	0	a	then the place we are going to justify that cost is through through design through making it a a sleek elegant high priced basic remote .
46280	0	a	Does that make sense , huh ?
46281	0	a	No I
46282	0	a	no
46283	0	a	I
46284	0	a	I understand what you say ,
46285	0	a	but what I am what I am ,
46286	1	a	okay we probably need to move along ,
46287	0	a	but my my concern is trying to find a marketing niche for this product , and if I am coming in with a with with twenty five Euros , which is mid market price , then what am I going to give these people for this ?
46288	0	a	So that is just my question , but we can keep talking .
46289	0	a	Yeah we probably should .
46290	0	a	We we are doing alright for time .
46291	0	a	Yeah .
46292	0	a	Okay .
46293	0	a	Sorry that kind of cut into you there .
46294	0	a	Right .
46295	0	a	No
46296	0	a	just I I would I would advocate for continuing teletext and those would be the basic commands .
46297	1	a	as for , you know , the the case design maybe I will come up with more concrete ideas .
46298	0	a	Right now it is just the idea of simplicity and slickness , cute and small
46299	0	a	Yeah .
46300	0	a	I am just thinking you know with all these universal remotes that are out there , how many people how many people actually use every feature
46301	0	a	that ar
46302	0	a	you know i like these trainable remotes and things like that , where , you know , it is just so confusing to do to use all these functions .
46303	0	a	Where I think the largest portion of the market is just going to you know they lost their TV remote , they need another one that will work with their TV .
46304	0	a	They want something that looks nice , that that that is not going to break when they drop it , that you know that maybe it is it is ergonomic , it feels good in your hand , something like that .
46305	0	a	I think that is going to be where you are going to find the biggest , you know , market share .
46306	0	a	So we are looking for something that looks good and just works , rather than looking for any special features .
46307	0	a	Is that
46308	0	a	I think the more bells and whistles we add , it is just going to cut into our into our profits .
46309	0	a	Because I think as we as we add costs for things like for like if we add the voice recognition and things like that , I think you know what percentage of the of the of the market is actually going to use that ?
46310	0	a	Maybe five percent , you know ,
46311	0	a	and how much
46312	0	a	Right .
46313	0	a	Yeah .
46314	1	a	But we can talk a little bit more potentially in the marketing marketing presentation about this .
46315	0	a	Yeah okay .
46316	0	a	Be a good idea .
46317	0	a	I am sorry .
46318	0	a	sorry , I did not mean to cut in .
46319	0	a	Yeah .
46320	0	a	Sorry boss .
46321	0	a	I am not the boss .
46322	0	a	Okay .
46323	1	a	Oh P Pedro , I just want to say quickly I
46324	1	a	I would really like it when you can come up with some more bells and whistles , eh .
46325	1	a	You know sell things come to my mind is something that is voice activated .
46326	0	a	I know we are getting into some , I hope , some big money on this thing , but
46327	0	a	Is that for over here ?
46328	0	a	Okay , alright .
46329	0	a	I think that is probably a question more for for this guy here , yeah .
46330	0	a	Yeah .
46331	0	a	Well it is kind of both of us .
46332	0	a	Us us user interface .
46333	0	a	Is it ?
46334	0	a	Okay .
46335	0	a	That is
46336	1	a	Cause and I think of voice activated
46337	0	a	I think of of how many times I have I have lost my my remote
46338	0	a	and I ca not find it .
46339	1	a	So some way that I can I can find my remote by clapping my hands or something
46340	0	a	and and so so
46341	0	a	But this is just something .
46342	0	a	I was thinking about that .
46343	0	a	Then your lights would go off , though .
46344	0	a	I am trying to find some bells and whistles
46345	1	a	cause when they talk about tel taking out teletext , it is like , what are we going to put in ?
46346	1	a	What makes this thing attractive ?
46347	0	a	And it is only for televisions .
46348	0	a	So we everyth
46349	0	a	our our competition out there has got these these multiple adaptors where they can use them for their VCRs , their DVDs , their their televisions and we are coming out with one remote for television only .
46350	0	a	And so to me we have to make this a really special product
46351	0	a	I
46352	0	a	I
46353	0	a	I do not s
46354	0	a	I really have to say I do not see the market niche for this product .
46355	0	a	Yeah .
46356	0	a	At this price I do not see it yet .
46357	1	a	I am I I go along with this ,
46358	0	a	because this is what we are given to try to market , but I I do not see the market niche for this product without without some really sort of something really special to identify it as as unique in the market .
46359	1	a	But we th that should be design .
46360	0	a	Yeah .
46361	1	a	That should be the design basically .
46362	0	a	Right .
46363	0	a	I think technology we would we
46364	0	a	we are not in the price range to do it .
46365	0	a	We do not have the money to do it towards t
46366	0	a	f technology
46367	1	a	so we should we should aim at design .
46368	0	a	Okay .
46369	0	a	Have to do you have to do it in the box ?
46370	0	a	Okay well , so so that is up to you then
46371	0	a	to to make this box in something that is absolutely extraordinary .
46372	0	a	Yeah .
46373	0	a	Yeah .
46374	0	a	Okay .
46375	1	a	Maybe make it in the form of a gun .
46376	1	a	We can sell it in United States .
46377	1	a	I have a question for you .
46378	0	a	Does any of the the features that Pedro is spoken about here have any implications we might not have thought about on in terms of just pure functionality ?
46379	0	a	In terms of making it work or the cost of that or
46380	0	a	Okay .
46381	0	a	I do not
46382	0	a	I think all these things are pretty standard .
46383	0	a	I think we will be okay .
46384	0	a	Kay .
46385	0	a	Cheers .
46386	0	a	Onto participant four .
46387	0	a	Well you know for marketing f marketing for me is
46388	0	a	and how do I go here ?
46389	0	a	Okay .
46390	1	a	you can just click .
46391	0	a	Go go .
46392	0	a	Is that right ?
46393	0	a	Ah ha .
46394	0	a	No no no
46395	1	a	you just get off that .
46396	1	a	You just click anywhere .
46397	0	a	Yeah , what for me is it
46398	0	a	I d I do not know what I am marketing right now , okay , until you spoke and when I wrote this , I do not know what I am marketing .
46399	0	a	I just know that I I was identified as a a we identified ourselves as a as a developer , as a manufacturer , and as a as a distributor t to other wholesalers .
46400	0	a	And so the th the twenty five Euros that we have identified as the sale price is a wholesale price rather than a retail price .
46401	0	a	That is what we decided here .
46402	0	a	so what I did is I
46403	0	a	I decided that that this this needs to be a product in a in a sense can market itself .
46404	0	a	So what we have identified here as our main marketing stratagem is is in design .
46405	0	a	We are making the most beautiful attractive whatever we decide it is .
46406	0	a	So that means we have about seven more minutes or ten minutes left .
46407	0	a	so I would like to have a product that that we can sell easily .
46408	0	a	So I say inspiration , so having something beauty , something attractive , something that in a sense will sell itself .
46409	0	a	innovation I think fits into what we are talking about here with design .
46410	0	a	cutting edge technology , I do not think we are going to have that , these were ideas I was putting together , unless we come up with some New Age product a as far as the casing is concerned .
46411	0	a	I I want to make this thing something that I can identify as special in some way ,
46412	0	a	so maybe we can have some
46413	0	a	I I talked about environmentally sensitive ,
46414	1	a	maybe we have a product that can be identified in some way as advantageous in a home .
46415	0	a	I do not know .
46416	0	a	These are just thoughts .
46417	1	a	I wanted to talk about who we are as a as a corporation ,
46418	0	a	that we are new , we are aggressive ,
46419	0	a	we are competitive , we are we are trying to provide a product from a new perspective rather than from an old corporate line .
46420	0	a	So to me it is about selling d our identity our corporate identity along with the product .
46421	0	a	what I found is that the projected costs are competitive .
46422	0	a	we are kind of in the middle of the market , but what I am seeing is that the market is ready for I
46423	0	a	I identified new technology , but again , because what I see is budget restrictions and limitations
46424	0	a	, I do not know that we can bring any new technology into this thing .
46425	1	a	If if we could have a technological something
46426	0	a	p
46427	0	a	please .
46428	1	a	I have an idea .
46429	0	a	And it is kind of along the s lines of environmentally sensitive , and it may even fit into ergonomics , and even kind of address the issue of losing losing the remote , what we were saying it is a common issue .
46430	0	a	what we can do is , well you know
46431	0	a	that batteries throwing a aw remotes run through batteries like crazy .
46432	0	a	Yeah .
46433	0	a	Right ?
46434	0	a	And s for some people
46435	0	a	Yeah .
46436	1	a	Solar .
46437	0	a	Well maybe not a solar remote
46438	1	a	but instead what about if we had like a power cradle ?
46439	1	a	Like a a cradle that is is there to hold the remote when you are not using it ,
46440	0	a	so you will always know where the remote is cause you have to put it back there to charge the remote ,
46441	1	a	and we can , instead of having instead of having , you know , replaceable batteries we will just have a power cell that stays there for the life of the remote .
46442	1	a	But solar
46443	0	a	, I like it .
46444	0	a	You never have to get go through the go through all these different batteries .
46445	0	a	And also you can
46446	0	a	I I think it is a good opportunity for the user design
46447	0	a	or for not just for the user design , but also for the just for the look and feel of the remote as as a whole .
46448	1	a	You know you could have some kind of neat little , you know , a sexy design for d a cradle and the remote itself .
46449	0	a	I like the idea ,
46450	0	a	but we are talking about in cost is going to probably double .
46451	0	a	It w it would increase the cost .
46452	0	a	But boy , we can sell this thing ,
46453	0	a	because there is no batteries , it is environmentally sensitive , i we can identify it as a safer product in some form .
46454	1	a	And you could page the remote if you lose it .
46455	1	a	Maybe there is a button on the cradle .
46456	0	a	Yep , that is right .
46457	0	a	I really see
46458	0	a	But the cost
46459	0	a	i
46460	0	a	No no .
46461	0	a	Now the the question is can we make this for less than twelve fifty per ?
46462	1	a	We we well do we necessarily have to change the end cost because Can we dl can we do that without changing it twelve fifty per product , if we basically can sell more based on this ?
46463	0	a	No no ,
46464	0	a	we have t we have to change the end cost .
46465	0	a	There is
46466	0	a	I mean I do not see it anyway .
46467	0	a	Yeah ,
46468	0	a	that is going to be up to these guys .
46469	0	a	I my reaction is no , but
46470	1	a	Well , see
46471	1	a	I
46472	1	a	I see
46473	1	a	I
46474	1	a	I am an advocate to make this an exclusive product .
46475	0	a	Well
46476	1	a	what I can do is I can d look into ho well Pedro
46477	1	a	and I can look into how much this might increase our our costs
46478	1	a	and you can look into what kind of effect an increased cost is going to have on our on our final numbers .
46479	0	a	Yeah
46480	1	a	we we can certainly push for a more expensive product if that is going to be
46481	0	a	Nah ,
46482	0	a	I think we can say with certainty now that we are supporting teletext .
46483	1	a	You know , let is let is sell this wholesale for for fifty Euros , sixty Euros .
46484	1	a	Let is make this thing really exclusive , environmentally sensitive , high tech design , ergonomics , all of this .
46485	1	a	Just make this thing , yeah , the the the Rolls Royce of of remote controls .
46486	0	a	I I
46487	0	a	Yeah .
46488	1	a	Every home is got to have it .
46489	0	a	If you do not have one ,
46490	0	a	hey what kind of remote do you have ?
46491	0	a	Oh you have got one of those ,
46492	0	a	oh fantastic ,
46493	0	a	I want one of those too .
46494	0	a	I just do not have enough money right now .
46495	0	a	I just do not know about that , because in order to do that in order to price it at that kind of level I think we would need to have every functionality that all the other competitors are offering like being able to operate , you know , the DVD player and , you know , the stereo system and all that .
46496	0	a	Which is a pretty basic function that w we have opted out of .
46497	0	a	And additionally we are m maybe not supporting teletext
46498	0	a	But I do think there are some basic features that we do not have that a lot of other remotes are going to have .
46499	0	a	Yep ,
46500	0	a	one one thing I do not understand is h they have they have given us this package , okay .
46501	1	a	Now in my opinion we need to give them a package back , okay .
46502	0	a	They say they say okay here you go .
46503	0	a	They gave us a fundament a foundation of of what they want , and and w it is our place to kind of analyse and evaluate .
46504	0	a	I do not think it is our place to create their product for them , maybe it is .
46505	0	a	I do not know what kind of role we have in this in the corporate ladder ,
46506	1	a	but to me it is like ,
46507	1	a	okay , you have got your here is our ideas , okay .
46508	1	a	And then let them look at those ideas and they say , yeah
46509	1	a	well , we can we can raise the price twenty percent , you know we like this idea , this idea no ,
46510	0	a	but to me it is it is about a choice ,
46511	1	a	do we follow their directives or do we make presentations back
46512	1	a	and and then and then discuss ?
46513	0	a	beca I
46514	0	a	I do not
46515	0	a	I do not see the market niche for the product that they are handing f handing us right now .
46516	0	a	I do not see it .
46517	0	a	I don I
46518	0	a	I d
46519	0	a	I have to disagree though .
46520	0	a	I think our market niche is basically people who need who have lost their remote or who have broken their remote and do not want to send back to the manufacturer , they just want to run out to the store and get a remote , and then they are going to look on the shelf and they are going to see ours is the nicest looking remote .
46521	0	a	It does what they need .
46522	0	a	These are not I I think that it
46523	0	a	Right .
46524	1	a	And and th to get to back to another point ,
46525	0	a	sorry for cutting in but ,
46526	0	a	I th
46527	0	a	I think it is important to remember that that this remote has to work with multiple TVs ,
46528	0	a	yeah , cause it is selling on its own .
46529	0	a	It is not going to be specifically for Hitachi TVs or or whatever .
46530	0	a	Right .
46531	0	a	Right .
46532	0	a	No I understand that .
46533	0	a	So technologically , if I understand it , TVs TV remote is working exactly the same way as video remotes and DVD remotes .
46534	0	a	All you need to do is train them to the individual one , all you need to do is is know the the f like some four digit code .
46535	0	a	So saying that it works with all TVs is equivalent to saying that it will work with DVDs and other things .
46536	0	a	Nope ,
46537	0	a	they have identified the product as not working for anything but televisions .
46538	0	a	Yeah y y
46539	0	a	you you would not
46540	0	a	The interface will be different .
46541	0	a	They have identified this product limita That is why I say I do not I do not see the market niche for this .
46542	0	a	Oh okay okay .
46543	0	a	We have done this .
46544	0	a	If we if w if we were going to have a product that worked for DVDs , VCRs and everything , then I can see the market niche , but we we are only identified as going for televisions without teletext .
46545	0	a	I see .
46546	0	a	And it is like whoa
46547	0	a	we ha in my opinion we have to go with something that is extremely exclusive to make this thing marketable , because who wants just a television remote ?
46548	0	a	I do not .
46549	0	a	Right .
46550	0	a	Well here is
46551	0	a	Right .
46552	0	a	And I
46553	0	a	I would
46554	0	a	sorry .
46555	1	a	We he well here is my thing about that .
46556	0	a	If you are in the market for this ultimate remote , you are not going to go for just a television remote .
46557	0	a	If it ca not control if it ca not control your your DVD player and a al
46558	0	a	if y if you ca not get that all in one ultimate remote , that just you can throw all your other remotes away .
46559	0	a	That is right .
46560	0	a	I am not going to buy a d seventy five Euro remote .
46561	0	a	I
46562	0	a	I
46563	0	a	I have a tendency to agree with you .
46564	0	a	I really do .
46565	0	a	So we really ca not chase that .
46566	0	a	That is why I say I quest I
46567	0	a	q I question the marketability of the product .
46568	0	a	I really question where we create the demand .
46569	0	a	So I think what we
46570	0	a	So that is what I am saying
46571	0	a	We are really looking for something basic .
46572	0	a	The the one thing that that that you said really struck a chord with me here in that we are we are carrying the corporate identity with the product , but we are actually looking for a large profit at the same time
46573	1	a	where I would be inclined to go back to upper level management and say like let is just cut down our profit expected on this product because we are actually branding our company here .
46574	0	a	We are selling more than just the product .
46575	0	a	We are trying to get mind share about Real Reaction to to the people who are going to buy consumer electronics .
46576	0	a	We want people to eventually say , oh that is that is Real Reaction that is a good m make .
46577	0	a	It is reliable .
46578	0	a	And and we are going to make it we are going to win mind share by either being a fantastic product or for it working , it just being good , reasonable priced , and solid .
46579	0	a	So if we can make if we can put an emphasis here on it not breaking I think that is in itself an extremely big thing .
46580	0	a	I think that is big .
46581	0	a	W okay
46582	0	a	if you if you drop the cost , now if you make if you make go to the other side of the cost scale , and you make it less expensive , then all of a sudden now we are going into an a a new market area .
46583	1	a	So we can say low cost good design , beautiful , wa da da da da da .
46584	0	a	Good design .
46585	0	a	We only have a few minutes left .
46586	0	a	But what I am saying is right now we are middle market .
46587	0	a	Is twenty five Euros a mid market price for a remote ?
46588	0	a	Okay .
46589	0	a	Yeah for for multi for a multi function remote , that is a mid market price .
46590	0	a	I think so , yeah .
46591	0	a	In a discount right now you can buy them on sale sometimes for about about eighteen , nineteen Euro , and that is for the multi functions , DVD , VCR , catch alls .
46592	0	a	Okay .
46593	0	a	And and they have them in a little box in the middle , and and this is the consciousness that most people have about replacement remote controls .
46594	1	a	So to me , to market this a t only a television remote control we have to change consciousness .
46595	0	a	We have to have something that will change people is thinking to identify this as advantageous , and I do not know what that is .
46596	0	a	It is gotta be low cost or high cost with with special design features .
46597	1	a	Well I would be inclined to say , if we can make the design better than any comparable remote while reducing the cost
46598	1	a	, then that is the way we really should play it .
46599	0	a	Yeah .
46600	1	a	If we can take it down to you know fifteen rather than twenty five and make a low profit margin on it , but we are really doing that to sell the brand .
46601	0	a	Yep we have five minutes left .
46602	1	a	rather th to to to sell for Real Reactions .
46603	0	a	Or my d
46604	0	a	I mean I
46605	0	a	I
46606	0	a	well
46607	0	a	we g
46608	0	a	we are talking about the other end now .
46609	1	a	And I can communicate this to to the more senior people within the company here to to get a reaction .
46610	0	a	What about the idea that I had with the cradle ?
46611	0	a	How do you feel about that ?
46612	0	a	Or how does everybody feel ?
46613	0	a	No ,
46614	0	a	but I that is the thing
46615	0	a	I
46616	0	a	I do not think it is necessarily the other end .
46617	0	a	Well how does everybody feel ?
46618	0	a	I
46619	0	a	I think The other the o
46620	0	a	the problem with that in my mind I just think off hand as a as a consumer , would I want to buy that ?
46621	0	a	And I think maybe not because I have got a remote and I will take it to different chairs , I will take it to different
46622	0	a	I
46623	0	a	w
46624	0	a	I do not want to go over somewhere and put it down .
46625	0	a	I like it .
46626	0	a	I like the idea ,
46627	0	a	but we have t we have to find out
46628	0	a	Well .
46629	1	a	It i if it is going to be somewhere that you put it down then it needs to be at the side of your armchair ,
46630	0	a	and that implies that there is only one TV user .
46631	0	a	Right .
46632	0	a	So it is very good for some people
46633	0	a	but it is not a like
46634	0	a	But it it takes away the ease of use of the remote to a certain extent .
46635	0	a	Well it lasts it would last for several hours on its own power , but when you are done with it you put it back in the cradle .
46636	0	a	Yeah
46637	0	a	well it
46638	0	a	You have to l sort of remember .
46639	0	a	You have to d shift down the side of the couch to find it and put it back and
46640	0	a	Yeah .
46641	0	a	I d
46642	0	a	I d
46643	0	a	I
46644	0	a	d I think it it in my mind
46645	0	a	it does not seem like something that oh I would really want because of that fact .
46646	0	a	But I I do not know , that is just my opinion .
46647	0	a	Well , I think again it is it we have a cost issue here .
46648	0	a	You know if we are going to go in this direction , to me we are going to the other side of the cost range .
46649	1	a	Are we going to make this selling selling the cost as a high high tech environmentally sensitive whatever , or are we going to go to the lower side of the range ?
46650	0	a	Again I do not see our market niche in the middle for our product yet .
46651	0	a	I do not see it yet .
46652	0	a	Kay .
46653	0	a	So what do we think maybe we should
46654	1	a	Pedro , do you have any opinion on it ?
46655	1	a	Really need to wrap up now .
46656	1	a	we should keep it simple , medium low cost mar cost area and make it look good .
46657	1	a	W a question I have in in a
46658	0	a	cause I
46659	0	a	I
46660	0	a	I think I agree with you on
46661	0	a	, we gotta make it a box .
46662	0	a	The box is going to sell it
46663	0	a	I think , the outside , the casing .
46664	0	a	Can can can we have multiple designs ?
46665	1	a	Have a modern , have a traditional , have a you know , and so so instead of them all looking the same , people can have maybe four or five different designs they can choose from .
46666	0	a	I do not know what that creates cost , or
46667	0	a	Yep one over another .
46668	0	a	Well the the problem with that is we may end up with a whole bunch of inventory of a of a poor design you know .
46669	0	a	Yeah , okay , I hear that .
46670	0	a	So
46671	0	a	but what we could do is some kind
46672	0	a	of well
46673	0	a	I mean
46674	1	a	Yeah we we need to ,
46675	1	a	I mean , have a few designs to look at and then come up with something that I think we all agree is , you know , the best fit .
46676	0	a	Yeah , complicated but
46677	0	a	Yeah .
46678	0	a	I think w what is really important is it has to look good
46679	0	a	, it has to feel it has to feel good in your hand , it has to be durable , it has to a
46680	0	a	and I think it is really important that it does not look cheap .
46681	0	a	Yeah .
46682	0	a	I think I think we have to make sure people look at it an and feel like it
46683	0	a	its like a quality remote .
46684	0	a	Even though the cost may be low .
46685	0	a	What ab what ab
46686	1	a	what about a a remote that is that does not maybe look like a remote ?
46687	0	a	Just an idea .
46688	0	a	Just just
46689	0	a	okay
46690	0	a	cause I mean we all know what a remote looks like on the outside .
46691	0	a	They are selling these things everywhere .
46692	1	a	Maybe that could be part of our design exclusivity , is we make a remote that does not even look like a remote it it opens like a telephone .
46693	1	a	Or what if it looks like a pen ?
46694	0	a	Yeah .
46695	0	a	Does not matter , yeah .
46696	0	a	I am just jus I talking about some something to make this thing unique .
46697	1	a	A pointer ?
46698	0	a	Yeah .
46699	0	a	It
46700	1	a	That is the thing , I am going to keep thumping on .
46701	1	a	I will sell whatever you guys design .
46702	0	a	Yeah .
46703	0	a	I do not have a problem selling a product , that is not the issue .
46704	0	a	I give you ideas , you guys create the product .
46705	1	a	Once you have the finished product I will find a way to sell it .
46706	0	a	Do not worry about it .
46707	0	a	I just give you these things now , because these are my thoughts and feelings .
46708	0	a	Okay .
46709	0	a	So
46710	1	a	just to touch on m my point one last time that I had brought up .
46711	0	a	I really
46712	1	a	un unless you guys are die hard against the fact that it is possible like it reduces the usability of the remote b and the fact that you ca not lose it on your own , I think it still might be a good idea to investigate having like a power cradle .
46713	0	a	Yeah .
46714	0	a	Okay .
46715	0	a	Yeah .
46716	0	a	Because I really think i in a certain sense it almost like for me
46717	0	a	I would want to have that just , because I know at the end of when I am done watching TV that when I am done , oh I better go find the remote and put it back where it belongs .
46718	0	a	Maybe th th th that is just some people that like that .
46719	0	a	I mean there is al
46720	0	a	there is also remote controls I remember that that worked , this has not been done in a while I think , but th as a as a watch .
46721	0	a	A lot of people
46722	0	a	As a watch ?
46723	0	a	kay .
46724	0	a	No no .
46725	0	a	Yeah ,
46726	0	a	there is remote control watches , but I think they are a sorta eighties thing ,
46727	0	a	so it might not be easy to market in it
46728	0	a	but the the technologies came along and it might be cheaper to make now .
46729	0	a	Yeah they are not simple .
46730	0	a	Those things may have been inexpensive for all I know .
46731	0	a	One thing I just thought about when you were saying that , is that the p our target market is going to be someone who has lost or broken
46732	0	a	We gotta stop ?
46733	0	a	Who is lost or broken their their remote .
46734	0	a	That is what I was saying .
46735	0	a	Gotta cut up .
46736	0	a	So how many remotes do they want to buy ?
46737	1	a	Can we p can we sell them a remote that can maybe guarantee they will not need to buy another one ?
46738	1	a	And so with with with this kind of system or locator or something , to to think about , how have people been been losing or breaking their remote ?
46739	1	a	How does this happen ?
46740	1	a	And and then and then design the product , maybe some component of the product that can identify this as the last one you will ever need to buy .
46741	0	a	Exactly .
46742	0	a	Yeah .
46743	0	a	The last remote you will ever buy .
46744	0	a	And also presumably they have
46745	0	a	Exactly .
46746	0	a	Well if if we are going down that then we can we do not need to go the
46747	0	a	it it strikes me that the locator feature might actually be quite expensive to make .
46748	0	a	Yeah .
46749	0	a	Whereas actually just putting it in a power cradle might not be too expensive at all
46750	0	a	because that is just done with mobile phones
46751	1	a	you can just
46752	1	a	n
46753	1	a	we we have said we have actually similar products that we can take from and potentially cut costs there .
46754	0	a	True .
46755	0	a	Right .
46756	0	a	Yeah .
46757	0	a	The locator will definitely be more expensive .
46758	1	a	need to look into whether we can do that
46759	0	a	but I think we we have some m mobile phone based products
46760	1	a	checking quickly our Internet .
46761	0	a	We really need to finish up here .
46762	1	a	we can make it in the shape of a coffee pot .
46763	0	a	But Yeah we have the the power adaptor products .
46764	0	a	We sell power adaptor products .
46765	0	a	So for example there is nothing stopping us using that technology .
46766	0	a	It is just it is that I think it is telling us to stop our meeting .
46767	0	a	Yeah .
46768	0	a	So we have the c we probably have have on line in our in our system , we have the ability to create this , we are talking about .
46769	0	a	Yeah I think so ,
46770	0	a	without it being too
46771	0	a	In fact we can cut costs through using the manufacturing that is already going to be in place here .
46772	0	a	A charging system .
46773	0	a	Right .
46774	0	a	If if we can create this we have probably five or six or seven really strong marketing characteristics .
46775	0	a	Right .
46776	1	a	I think one of the things that we can put right on the box is , never buy another battery .
46777	0	a	Okay .
46778	0	a	Yep .
46779	0	a	Kay .
46780	0	a	 
46781	0	a	Afternoon guys .
46782	0	a	It is going to be .
46783	0	a	Rock and roll .
46784	0	a	Oh .
46785	0	a	Kay .
46786	0	a	So do we need to re train Mike on how to put his mic on ?
46787	0	a	Okay , can he get it all by himself this time ?
46788	0	a	So
46789	0	a	I believe I can fly .
46790	0	a	Think s .
46791	0	a	We may do .
46792	0	a	I dunno , I am feeling like a big boy .
46793	0	a	Pro
46794	0	a	Probably not , cause he is Is been listening to too much .
46795	0	a	He is getting retarded .
46796	0	a	Alright well we got some exciting stuff for you guys .
46797	0	a	Yay .
46798	0	a	Or not .
46799	0	a	Or not .
46800	0	a	Yeah .
46801	0	a	Just what I needed was something exciting .
46802	0	a	Remember , I am an old man .
46803	0	a	Kay , ready to go ?
46804	0	a	Kay
46805	0	a	so we have got our conceptual design meeting .
46806	0	a	All ready .
46807	0	a	Apparently I am old as well .
46808	1	a	Hopefully we have all got exciting ideas now .
46809	0	a	Thirty is really young , eh ?
46810	0	a	Jose he man is .
46811	1	a	We do .
46812	0	a	k exciting ideas .
46813	0	a	Kay so here is our agenda our agenda .
46814	1	a	I am going to open .
46815	1	a	I am going to talk for a bit about what we are going to do .
46816	1	a	I am going to take some notes .
46817	0	a	We are going to all do a presentation , and then hopefully we are going to make some decisions now .
46818	0	a	Yep .
46819	0	a	Alright .
46820	0	a	Well when I say hopefully , we have to .
46821	0	a	So I am going to let you guys talk before we make decisions .
46822	1	a	And does anyone really want to go first ?
46823	0	a	You p two ?
46824	0	a	What is
46825	0	a	Components design .
46826	1	a	I guess I will go first .
46827	0	a	Yeah .
46828	0	a	Component , I think .
46829	0	a	Yeah .
46830	0	a	Yep that is it .
46831	0	a	Presented by name .
46832	0	a	My name is .
46833	0	a	Your name is name ?
46834	0	a	Huh hi name .
46835	0	a	My name is name .
46836	0	a	My name is Inigo Montoya .
46837	0	a	You killed my father .
46838	0	a	Sorry
46839	0	a	I did this in a bit of a rush .
46840	0	a	Prepare to die .
46841	0	a	N name .
46842	0	a	So so here is a look inside your really old looking remote control .
46843	0	a	Right .
46844	0	a	you have got a printed a printed circuit board here , and you have got all these buttons which kind of press down little rubber nubbies into these little holes that activate
46845	0	a	Yeah we have all broken a remote control .
46846	0	a	We have all broke a remote control ri s
46847	0	a	yeah .
46848	0	a	I have
46849	0	a	I just love you tech guys , huh .
46850	0	a	So you have also got you have got your chip here , your batteries here , and some sorta electronics .
46851	0	a	Well
46852	0	a	so you have got here is here
46853	0	a	is a transistor , and this amplifies your signal , you have got the LED here on the end of the on the end of the printed circuit board .
46854	0	a	Yeah y do jabber
46855	0	a	Yeah there is a thingy and a dingy and
46856	0	a	Nah .
46857	0	a	You press this and it does th I dunno who and whatnot .
46858	0	a	you have got a couple diodes here for I do not know who and whatnot .
46859	0	a	So exactly .
46860	0	a	So we have got a i in this in this drawing he in this example here , this is a eighteen pin chip
46861	0	a	I dunno .
46862	0	a	P
46863	0	a	Yeah .
46864	0	a	it is two double A batteries .
46865	0	a	This is pretty standard remote .
46866	0	a	So here are options for our power sources .
46867	0	a	You can use a basic battery , which we have already discussed , th our tech department also said we have the option of doing some kind of hand dynamo where maybe you crank it or something like that .
46868	0	a	I do not know if that is really
46869	0	a	I do not know we got some qu crazy guys down there in that department
46870	0	a	so
46871	0	a	You shake it .
46872	0	a	Kay .
46873	0	a	I want to change that .
46874	0	a	Okay .
46875	0	a	I
46876	0	a	I gotta
46877	0	a	I gotta flashlight ,
46878	0	a	and yeah
46879	0	a	but it is interesting cause you shake it like this .
46880	0	a	Like this .
46881	0	a	Yeah .
46882	0	a	So that is the next bullet is the the kinetic provision of energy , so it is like that flashlight where you have to shake it .
46883	0	a	And that is on the camera .
46884	0	a	Yeah .
46885	0	a	Kay .
46886	0	a	we have got solar cells ,
46887	0	a	which I do not think is a very good idea because you could not use your remote at night which does not make a lot of sense .
46888	0	a	kay .
46889	0	a	And finally we have got our cradle o our power cradle idea .
46890	0	a	Okay so we basically have battery versus cradle here ?
46891	0	a	Okay .
46892	0	a	M battery versus cradle
46893	0	a	I think is
46894	0	a	yeah .
46895	0	a	I like the kinetic .
46896	0	a	So we have battery versus cradle
46897	0	a	It is actually a novel thing because you could sell it a as a novelty ,
46898	1	a	just to be actually serious for a minute here ,
46899	0	a	you could
46900	0	a	I g
46901	0	a	I
46902	0	a	I figured you would .
46903	0	a	It could be fun .
46904	0	a	Yes .
46905	0	a	Yeah .
46906	0	a	Yeah .
46907	0	a	Well it is it is more
46908	0	a	I mean it is more eco friendly than the than the cradle
46909	0	a	cause you are still using power off the grid with the cradle .
46910	0	a	So our case design .
46911	0	a	We have choices in materials and choices in the general shapes that we can do .
46912	0	a	Our material choices are a plastic latex ty or plastic , a rubber latex type thing , wood , or titanium .
46913	0	a	If we go with titanium we are going to be limited in the amount of shapes we can do because it is tough to shape the titanium , and
46914	0	a	Yeah pers
46915	0	a	I think wood
46916	0	a	i
46917	0	a	I I ca not see anybody wanting to use a wooden remote ,
46918	0	a	it is just anti technology really , you know .
46919	1	a	Wood wood would ge would give us a little bit of a marketing niche , would not it .
46920	0	a	Nah .
46921	0	a	It it it
46922	0	a	Okay .
46923	0	a	to me in a marketing sense it is not it is not relative .
46924	1	a	We can we can o we can accentuate whatever whatever product you put in there we can find a way to accentuate it .
46925	0	a	Right .
46926	1	a	And what we may be able to do , and I think this might be the best option is to combine some a couple of these .
46927	0	a	Okay .
46928	1	a	my recommendation personally would be to do some kind of a plastic inner shell with a like a rubber outer shell ,
46929	0	a	to make it to mak like a thick plastic inner shell and a t kind of a to have that rubber outer shell to make it more durable ,
46930	0	a	and also maybe i I think it feels a little better than the plastic .
46931	0	a	Kay .
46932	0	a	Do you get a good grip on the rubber ?
46933	0	a	Yeah okay .
46934	0	a	Yeah
46935	0	a	Yeah .
46936	1	a	And if you make it from that super rubber , when you drop it on the floor it can bounce right back up in your hand .
46937	1	a	You do not even need to lean down to get it .
46938	0	a	The advantages of working with plastic and rubber is w we we will have a lot more options just in terms of shape because you can extrude plastic in basically any shape you want .
46939	1	a	So and then we can cover you know the breakable bits with rubber
46940	1	a	yeah
46941	1	a	so
46942	0	a	But basically these are curved and double curved
46943	0	a	I
46944	0	a	I believe that the tech department , in their in their message to me , that they were referring to the number of th curves in the bottom .
46945	0	a	Okay .
46946	0	a	I have no idea exactly what they are talking about , but that is what they told me , uncurved , flat , curved , or double curved .
46947	0	a	Okay .
46948	1	a	I would guess this like this pen would be kind of like a double curved , where it is curved on m m multiple axes , right ?
46949	0	a	I think curved means just curved in one axis
46950	1	a	and double curved is curved in two axes or surfaces .
46951	0	a	Okay .
46952	1	a	I have no idea .
46953	1	a	I think it might mean something like that sorta shape because a double curve rather than a
46954	0	a	yeah that is what .
46955	0	a	yeah that is
46956	0	a	yeah
46957	0	a	that is what I see .
46958	0	a	Oh okay
46959	0	a	oh like a wave , okay .
46960	0	a	Yeah that is what I see also .
46961	0	a	Alright that makes sense okay .
46962	0	a	okay , with the interface we have the following options , we can u we can use push buttons , we can use a scroll wheel with an integrated push button , and LCD display , or multiple scrolling wheels .
46963	0	a	Ooh .
46964	0	a	so these are all options that the user interface guy can has at his disposal to put together a user interface .
46965	0	a	Okay .
46966	0	a	For electronics , we have these very technical descriptions here .
46967	0	a	A simple chip , which is the least expensive , but I have no numbers to give you , a regular chip , which is like the medium porridge the medium expense Yes
46968	0	a	the difference is , with a simple chip a simple chip will operate
46969	0	a	oh why does not this scroll up ?
46970	0	a	Previous previous , okay .
46971	0	a	D do we have actually any concept of what the difference is between a simple chip and an advanced chip ?
46972	0	a	Okay .
46973	0	a	A simple chip is required to operate push buttons .
46974	0	a	an advanced chip is required to to operate the LCD display , and it did not say specifically ,
46975	0	a	but I I have a hunch that a regular chip is going to be the scroll wheel and the multiple scroll wheels .
46976	0	a	Okay .
46977	0	a	So but yeah .
46978	0	a	Yeah that makes sense .
46979	0	a	That is the end of my presentation .
46980	1	a	So presentation from I guess design would go best .
46981	1	a	Next .
46982	0	a	Technical functions or interface concept ?
46983	0	a	Yeah that is it .
46984	0	a	I think
46985	0	a	No .
46986	0	a	Oh interface concept .
46987	0	a	Very long presentation .
46988	0	a	Yes , but it has your name on it .
46989	0	a	Well that does not bo bode well for it for it tats as well .
46990	0	a	so ,
46991	0	a	somehow that thing is too big , but
46992	0	a	okay
46993	0	a	our manufacturing division wanted the speech recognition .
46994	0	a	They say they could put it to work
46995	0	a	but we do not think so .
46996	0	a	No .
46997	0	a	It it it
46998	0	a	you will be you know be affected by the by the other speech and
46999	0	a	Yeah and and fighting for the remote would not be fun anymore ,
47000	0	a	and I think that is one of the things we want to keep .
47001	0	a	If the TV is working ,
47002	0	a	yeah .
47003	0	a	That is just
47004	0	a	I mean it will if somebody says up in the middle of a television show , it is going to change the channel .
47005	0	a	So
47006	1	a	Well then why do not you just press the up button ?
47007	0	a	Even still there is going to be interf th
47008	0	a	there is there still will be interference from the TV .
47009	1	a	But what if you actually had to press a button to make it recognize ?
47010	1	a	So if you pressed it and went , up ?
47011	0	a	Man
47012	0	a	yeah .
47013	0	a	That kind of would r d
47014	0	a	yeah .
47015	0	a	That would kind of lose it .
47016	1	a	But if it is just one thing with a button that you can just go
47017	0	a	Up .
47018	0	a	That is right .
47019	0	a	It might not be it might not be completely confusing ,
47020	0	a	but I think you will still y
47021	0	a	it is still
47022	0	a	I do not think it is practical at all .
47023	0	a	Yeah , okay .
47024	0	a	I think it is a bad idea frankly .
47025	0	a	Yeah so taking that away , our the the the rubber but rubber buttons are the more reliable it is the the ones that would al would allow us to to market our product as being you know less prone to damage and more resistant to things like spillage of liquids over it
47026	0	a	or you know mistreat misuses as it happens to remote controls .
47027	0	a	Okay .
47028	0	a	You guys know your stuff .
47029	0	a	as for the point that we making about losing it .
47030	0	a	Well , we want to small r remote control one side because we want it to be cool and designed , but apparently market shows that bigger s bigger remotes get less lost ,
47031	0	a	about
47032	1	a	But yeah I think we we need to compromise between those two and somehow we will do that .
47033	0	a	That I would believe .
47034	1	a	Somehow .
47035	1	a	so the the what I would propose is something more or less in the direction of what is to yo the right of that slide but without with a l a less complicated design , so the numbers , the volume control , and channel control , and teletext access .
47036	1	a	the volume and channel control can just become those the the four button array as in if it was a round dial .
47037	1	a	And if you just think about it as the one to the right but with the numbers and the four buttons plus maybe a centre one with teletext .
47038	0	a	So we are suggesting doing a sorta scroll wheel thing for the volume ?
47039	0	a	Nah .
47040	0	a	no it is not i
47041	0	a	i
47042	0	a	it is just four buttons that are on a cross , so
47043	0	a	that you ba basically can control all of the important tasks from that alone .
47044	0	a	That is not a scroll wheel .
47045	0	a	Oh okay okay .
47046	0	a	I see .
47047	0	a	Right .
47048	0	a	Instead of play , stop , rewind , and fast forward there , that is up , down , louder , and quieter .
47049	0	a	, okay .
47050	0	a	Okay .
47051	0	a	Yeah
47052	1	a	yeah
47053	1	a	so I think we w
47054	1	a	we go for something mid sized , so something looks good and is not too prone to get lost .
47055	0	a	That be it .
47056	0	a	Kay .
47057	0	a	So on to Y functional requirements or trend watching ?
47058	0	a	forty six nineteen fifty seven .
47059	0	a	I dunno .
47060	0	a	Trend watching has a later date there .
47061	0	a	Trend watching I guess .
47062	0	a	Trend watching I believe .
47063	1	a	See what it looks like .
47064	0	a	Yep .
47065	0	a	It is been so long .
47066	0	a	Well I do not know what to say .
47067	0	a	When I s when I see the when I see the product
47068	0	a	I
47069	0	a	I
47070	0	a	I
47071	0	a	I do not want to buy it .
47072	0	a	I see so many of them out there .
47073	0	a	There is nothing about that product that makes me want to choose that product over other products that are out there .
47074	0	a	Are you talking about the picture ?
47075	0	a	That is not our that is not our b design , that is just a that is just something he a a graphic he used to show you the layout of what the layout of the buttons might be like .
47076	0	a	Yeah yeah .
47077	0	a	Okay .
47078	0	a	Okay .
47079	0	a	Okay cause cause right now I do not have too much to say about how to market this product because we do not have a product to market yet .
47080	0	a	And from from talking to Mike is that we have we have we can market a more expensive product now .
47081	0	a	That is what I understand so ,
47082	0	a	hello .
47083	0	a	Upper management said yes .
47084	0	a	e excuse that , that is a bit of spam .
47085	0	a	And and so yeah
47086	0	a	I am a I am a little bit stuck right now in that
47087	0	a	what w what is it that I am going to market ?
47088	0	a	without special or increased marketable features I do not believe the product has a consumer demand .
47089	0	a	I like the idea of of the scroll
47090	0	a	makin
47091	0	a	there are so many people making these products at this price right now .
47092	1	a	What are we going to do to make this one special and unique ?
47093	0	a	well I do not
47094	0	a	yeah it is I
47095	0	a	I just see it as different .
47096	0	a	What is special and unique about a scroll ?
47097	0	a	Well right I think the two big th points that we have so far are the having the cradle and also having the the actual design of the case itself having like this like rubber shell maybe with a plastic interior , having it look really nice and also be really durable .
47098	0	a	It is cool .
47099	0	a	I do not say it is specially
47100	0	a	I do not say it is special .
47101	0	a	I say that it is different
47102	0	a	I what I am looking for as marketing is
47103	0	a	m give me something different .
47104	1	a	I give me a lower price , give me a higher price , give me some new technology ,
47105	0	a	do not give me the same thing that everybody else is putting out there on the shelf it is f at the same price .
47106	1	a	I need something to market about this thing .
47107	0	a	We are we are a new firm .
47108	0	a	I would I would say though that we if we did make the decision to go with the cradle though , the then we have that as well ,
47109	0	a	but wi with a similar
47110	0	a	What i if when when we have
47111	0	a	yeah
47112	0	a	when we when we have something like the cradle or or something give that is
47113	0	a	as as a marketing standard I need something to market , to make this product unique .
47114	0	a	Yep .
47115	0	a	kay .
47116	0	a	Just remember when I made up this report I did not have the information that we are discussing here .
47117	0	a	Right
47118	0	a	yeah .
47119	0	a	And and so so yeah when we have a cradle , when we have some kind of design , so what I am saying is , from my perspective , I do not have a product to market right now .
47120	0	a	Course .
47121	0	a	Yeah .
47122	0	a	my personal preference is that we make some adjustment in the cost , either lower or develop an integrated new technol technology .
47123	0	a	That is that is the next step , there is technology and then there is technology , which we are moving into the next phase .
47124	0	a	Yeah cause that is .
47125	0	a	And so we are going to have some new technology to enhance the marketability .
47126	0	a	Yeah again I am not sold on the product
47127	0	a	because we do not have a product in my opinion yet .
47128	0	a	So I need a product .
47129	0	a	kay .
47130	1	a	Well let is get a product then .
47131	0	a	I need a product to market .
47132	0	a	And I just whatever product you guys put together , we will find a way to market it .
47133	0	a	Tha that I am not concerned with .
47134	0	a	So now
47135	0	a	So our big questions here really are cradle or not cradle ?
47136	0	a	Do we go basic or do we go for features ?
47137	0	a	d does anyone really want to do anything with the scroll wheel or should we ditch that off hand first ?
47138	0	a	Oh but that was in your presentation
47139	0	a	so wh what would you imagine it doing ?
47140	0	a	If you if you give me if you give me a cut out of what everybody else has then I need to I need to find a lower cost .
47141	1	a	Well my question is what would the scroll wheel do ?
47142	1	a	Function wise , what does that do that
47143	0	a	Yeah .
47144	0	a	Yeah wh wh what is the wh
47145	0	a	Okay
47146	0	a	now what I see with the scroll wheel is everybody has buttons .
47147	0	a	Well it is it is just another way to do the exact same thing that the buttons do .
47148	0	a	But would we
47149	0	a	I dunno .
47150	0	a	So from a marketing standpoint I have I have another door to walk through when we have something that is unique .
47151	0	a	kay
47152	0	a	Yeah .
47153	0	a	If it creates something more complex or more expensive , then I do not know if that makes it a marketing necessity .
47154	0	a	But again , from a marketing perspective I want as much new and different about this thing as possible because we are we are co it is a very competitive market .
47155	0	a	What I understand about scroll wheels is they are they are quite expensive to to make .
47156	0	a	Yeah .
47157	0	a	Th they are going to be more expensive , but on the other hand , I mean , it I mean it is an alternative if if you think that is going to sell some some you know
47158	0	a	if if we are going to make up the extra cost by extra sales I think maybe it is worth it to do it ,
47159	1	a	but I mean I would just use if I was going to do this I would just use the scroll wheel for s channels up and channels down .
47160	0	a	So I d
47161	0	a	Well
47162	0	a	I
47163	0	a	d I like the idea of basically focusing the
47164	0	a	my personal preference is focusing the p the product on the idea of the the case the the dock to put it in to to charge it .
47165	0	a	I do not think volume
47166	0	a	or do you think volume would be
47167	0	a	No we can we can do multiple scroll wheels but
47168	0	a	I will bet first in volume maybe .
47169	0	a	I dunno .
47170	1	a	We can target like environmentally friendly ideas , that sorta things .
47171	0	a	It s i m makes it easy to market , it is easy to differentiate the product ,
47172	0	a	yeah so .
47173	0	a	Yeah yeah .
47174	0	a	I think it is
47175	0	a	that is right .
47176	0	a	I think so .
47177	1	a	And if we we keep the rest in a format that is durable
47178	0	a	because th th the whole product is going to need to be more durable th thus because you are not going to be ditching it as often .
47179	0	a	It is going to need to be more expensive because of the cradle .
47180	1	a	So if we can market it in terms of that
47181	0	a	and yeah well So our big decision then is like how do we do like
47182	0	a	we have to decide on the details and we have to decide on well n not exactly the details ,
47183	0	a	but d do we have
47184	0	a	What type of casing ?
47185	0	a	I personally like what you were saying about the plastic with the rubber .
47186	0	a	Yep .
47187	0	a	I think we got some exclusivity in that , you know , we got something that nobody else has right now , and and that means we can we can make some adjustments in the retail or wholesale price if we need to and it also can create it is own demand from it is uniqueness .
47188	0	a	Yeah .
47189	1	a	I am thinking yeah something like kind of almost like these pens , you know , where there is you have plastic bits
47190	0	a	and then it is not really rubber
47191	1	a	but just kind of like a fused the plastic with rubber on the outside .
47192	0	a	Okay .
47193	1	a	Just a very thin sorta sheet for a a grip , sorta thing or for
47194	0	a	Okay .
47195	0	a	Well no ma
47196	0	a	yeah
47197	1	a	maybe a bit more then th is on here
47198	0	a	but ju just as a kind of an inspiration , these pens I think are are kind of Or from from my perspective
47199	0	a	I think LCD is a mistake because this is a universal remote and all you are doing
47200	0	a	I mean it is you are not going to get any information back from the television , so the only information you can display on this remote is what channel you just sent it at last and there is just not a lot of information , you know , there .
47201	0	a	So then if we
47202	0	a	d d do we want to do anything more basic with the more advanced with the user interface in terms of do we want to go for buttons , or do we want if we are ditching the scroll wheels do we want to go LCD ?
47203	1	a	Do we want to give do we want to have anything else on it ?
47204	0	a	Okay .
47205	0	a	It is only a TV .
47206	0	a	It receives no information .
47207	0	a	So I I do not see any reason for having an LCD cause it is an increased cost .
47208	1	a	Unless you can think of something interesting to do with it .
47209	0	a	Yeah .
47210	0	a	Yeah right now there is right now there is nothing coming out of the TV to receive , so you know unless technology changes and information starts coming out of the a cable box or something there is no s
47211	0	a	I do not see the
47212	0	a	, I do not see the necessity of an LCD either .
47213	0	a	Right .
47214	0	a	Do not see it .
47215	0	a	Okay so
47216	0	a	the question is now I guess we need t to decide on
47217	0	a	well y you guys basically have to now go and figure out the details of this thing .
47218	0	a	So , what we need to know in terms of marketing and project management are are there any other questions that we need to answer now before you guys can go and build this ?
47219	0	a	What what overall things have we not decided on ?
47220	0	a	I think maybe in terms of marketing , is that going to make enough of a difference to justify the cost ?
47221	0	a	Yeah
47222	0	a	and I guess th th the question th th that you are being asked right now is whether is the dock enough of a unique feature to be able to go out and sell that a a as a a very different product , or do we really need the scroll wheel as well ?
47223	0	a	Because the scroll wheel comes at quite a cost .
47224	0	a	Well we have to I think for me it is still not exactly clear exactly what the inter user interface is going to be .
47225	0	a	There is the scroll wheel , in or out ?
47226	0	a	What do you guys like in the user interface ?
47227	0	a	Well I dunno about like the flip phone idea , because I think , as far as durability th it is not
47228	0	a	a big
47229	1	a	well maybe when it is closed .
47230	0	a	Again .
47231	0	a	Well I think it is it is the more uniqueness you can bring to the product
47232	0	a	, the easier it is , I believe , for me to market .
47233	0	a	again the push buttons I I see are are everywhere .
47234	1	a	And so we can go with the same thing ,
47235	0	a	but we are going to be com competing in a in a broader market than if we go with something unique .
47236	1	a	You know the other thing I thought about was
47237	1	a	you know , do we go to something like this ?
47238	1	a	Make a remote that does not look like a remote .
47239	0	a	It is just another it is just a an idea ,
47240	0	a	and I do not know
47241	0	a	I mean what I see one of the things one of the things you brought up in an earlier presentation is , when you got children , their their stuff gets inside the circuitry , they get dirty , they get messy with drinks and stuff .
47242	0	a	This
47243	0	a	And what I keep throwing out there I just keep throwing out ideas to try to make this thing look or act or in some way identify itself as unique or different .
47244	0	a	But you guys are the ones that have to c ultimately create the product within cost .
47245	0	a	Oh okay
47246	0	a	phew .
47247	0	a	Yeah .
47248	0	a	I think you gotta g get into cost effectiveness .
47249	0	a	I think if you can have the base station with a with a locator , I think those are two very strong features ,
47250	0	a	if that is something that can be integrated without a bunch of extra cost .
47251	0	a	Well The
47252	0	a	The locator is going to require a radio transmitter ,
47253	0	a	which will
47254	0	a	we are probably going to have to go with a like a medium chip , s I would imagine .
47255	0	a	That is going to n is that going to need a better chip as well ?
47256	1	a	And it is presumably going to need a little speaker in it or something like that as well to beep .
47257	0	a	No it is just different .
47258	0	a	But we I we will need a receiver , an antenna .
47259	0	a	Integrated , yeah .
47260	0	a	Yeah .
47261	0	a	So it is just I
47262	0	a	I think that is
47263	0	a	I know personally that would be a very attractive feature , is to have a have a button I can push to find my remote control .
47264	0	a	It should be a really simple signal though so
47265	0	a	That is true yeah .
47266	1	a	But I guess a little tiny speaker is going to be quite cheap ,
47267	0	a	it is not going to need q quality , is it ?
47268	0	a	It is
47269	1	a	Makes your living room more fresh as you watch .
47270	0	a	Oh yeah
47271	0	a	yeah .
47272	0	a	It will be really cheap .
47273	1	a	Or maybe you can like have
47274	1	a	a a smell o rama
47275	1	a	, you know you push a button
47276	1	a	and it s puts out a stink .
47277	0	a	You can
47278	0	a	Yeah
47279	0	a	yeah
47280	0	a	yeah
47281	0	a	yeah .
47282	0	a	Maybe not
47283	0	a	Okay we are doing well for time here .
47284	0	a	S
47285	0	a	Yeah .
47286	0	a	we have got about another ten minutes .
47287	0	a	I think that
47288	0	a	pr my personal preference is out .
47289	0	a	So the scroll wheel , in or out ?
47290	0	a	For me I think the scroll wheel actually might not be so bad .
47291	0	a	I do not think the cost is justified for a little bit more uniqueness when we already have that , and I do not s think it is obvious and natural how it would be used .
47292	0	a	Yeah I think we have like
47293	0	a	and it is not very usable
47294	0	a	and it will bring down the robustness of the whole thing , cause it is it it breaks down easier .
47295	0	a	Yeah .
47296	0	a	I do not know exactly what the increased cost is going to be ,
47297	0	a	but I think he does have a point ,
47298	1	a	i it might push somebody over the edge when they are looking at our at our remote versus something else , when they see this one has a scroll wheel to go up and down on the channels .
47299	0	a	I think it might be kind of neat to be able to do it like that .
47300	0	a	But then that that surely d depends a little on the TV because some TVs are quite slow at changing channels from like so
47301	1	a	if you have got a scroll wheel and you s
47302	1	a	you have to scroll scroll it really really slowly
47303	1	a	just so that you are actually keeping in pace with the TV is ability to to change channels .
47304	0	a	W
47305	0	a	Yeah .
47306	0	a	Sure .
47307	1	a	Or do you have to go through and you wait for it ?
47308	1	a	You scroll it a bunch of times and you wait for it to
47309	1	a	Well I think wh what it would be is like like the m like this , where it is maybe you know a digital wheel , right , where it is where it is quantized into you know certain
47310	0	a	That was that was my my intuition of what the scroll wheel would be .
47311	0	a	Oh yeah .
47312	0	a	I see I see .
47313	0	a	That is where you
47314	0	a	I see I see what you are talking about now .
47315	0	a	Yeah .
47316	0	a	Okay .
47317	0	a	It is just it is basically it it is just a f look and feel thing .
47318	0	a	It has the same exact functionality as two buttons .
47319	0	a	I I think there is you know that there are so many people today
47320	0	a	that are that are surfing are television surfers , and I see the scroll as a as a great mechanism for surfing .
47321	1	a	Instead of going button to bu you just j you would j j j j j j .
47322	1	a	Yeah if you are just sitting there going
47323	0	a	That is kind of cool actually .
47324	0	a	Yeah .
47325	0	a	I really I really think that is a really cool thing for surfing .
47326	0	a	I like that .
47327	0	a	Now just just so you know though you did bring up a point which is very valid , is a lot of TVs wo not re the TVs wo not respond exactly the same .
47328	0	a	Some of them are going to be kind of slow switching , so you may like queue up like fifteen channel changes , and it will be like flip , flip , flip .
47329	0	a	Well there is ano
47330	0	a	That is right .
47331	0	a	But
47332	0	a	Right .
47333	0	a	Well not n necessarily .
47334	1	a	You could basically make it so that it will I mean it is just going to be sending a signal to the TV
47335	1	a	yeah
47336	1	a	the TV is ge so if you send about five flip channels , if you did that it is going to flip once .
47337	0	a	If you do that .
47338	0	a	Yeah it just might be frustrating where you ca not make it go as fast as you want ,
47339	0	a	but I think once people get used to it
47340	0	a	I I do like the idea of the scroll wheel though .
47341	0	a	Other than click click click .
47342	0	a	Yeah .
47343	1	a	And if we are marketing it as a high niche product , then we are going to be selling it to people who are buying good TVs as well , yeah , presumably .
47344	0	a	Yeah I think so .
47345	0	a	Primarily .
47346	0	a	I I think so .
47347	0	a	Yep .
47348	0	a	Now the the only thing I I on the interface side of it , is that I
47349	0	a	I
47350	0	a	I see the dilemma .
47351	1	a	But if we have the option of of scrolling at any particular speed , or the option of jumping direct , okay .
47352	1	a	So I can go presuming I have , on my television , something that tells me what channel I am on , I can scroll direct from channel five to channel thirty two .
47353	0	a	I know what because it is on the television .
47354	0	a	The television tells me what channel it is on when I change it .
47355	0	a	So I do not know that really that is that is going to be a a d problem ,
47356	0	a	cause the television can go automatically from channel five to channel thirty two with the push of a button .
47357	0	a	Okay ?
47358	1	a	So ca can we can we create that kind of interface within a scroll system ?
47359	0	a	You understand what I am saying ?
47360	0	a	Oh no
47361	1	a	we could read it from the television .
47362	0	a	I think I know what you might be getting at , or or
47363	1	a	Well , what about this what about if you can programme in your favourite channels into this scroll wheel and you can just like roll through your favourite channels ,
47364	0	a	and it c it
47365	0	a	Why ?
47366	0	a	It will tell you when you flip the channel on the TV .
47367	0	a	Oh I see
47368	1	a	so if maybe if we had an LCD up the top that just did a number on it , right ?
47369	0	a	And then it that basically
47370	0	a	Well that is quite cool .
47371	1	a	You would need a display on the th the thing .
47372	0	a	Yeah the the television can tell you .
47373	0	a	Yeah .
47374	0	a	Can .
47375	0	a	Oh yeah
47376	0	a	yeah
47377	0	a	no
47378	0	a	I see what you are talking about .
47379	0	a	Yeah that is kind of cool .
47380	0	a	How would you program it though ?
47381	0	a	Okay okay .
47382	0	a	Well you just it is one extra button .
47383	0	a	You say programme start , and then type in cause you still have the typing you know you will still have the keypad where you can type them in manually .
47384	0	a	Put And then .
47385	1	a	So programme start , zero , one , enter , zero , five , enter , thirty eight , enter , programme end .
47386	0	a	Okay
47387	0	a	and yeah
47388	0	a	and that just basically flips between it
47389	0	a	and it will go it sends out zero , five , and then thirty six , and then zero , one again .
47390	0	a	Yeah that is kind of cool .
47391	0	a	I like that .
47392	0	a	And again we have another another great marketing tool .
47393	0	a	We have about three we have three or four things here .
47394	0	a	That is not going to be too expensive
47395	1	a	because that is going to be you are going to be able to nab that off of computer mouse manufacturers really .
47396	1	a	You could basically come up with a partnership to be able to produce that quite cheaply .
47397	0	a	I dunno
47398	1	a	and an maybe we maybe even have this as in house technology .
47399	0	a	Yeah .
47400	1	a	This may be something that is available through our own through our own services .
47401	0	a	Might be ,
47402	0	a	but tha that is not going to be such a costly feature .
47403	0	a	The problem we are going to have is making it robust .
47404	1	a	Oh well we also have to determine in some manner how to switch between modes , between going through your favourites list and just hitting up one , up two .
47405	0	a	Making it last .
47406	1	a	Or we go directional up
47407	1	a	we go
47408	1	a	we go this
47409	1	a	we go this
47410	1	a	we go this way for one
47411	1	a	, we go this way for the other .
47412	1	a	So if there is a button for each type .
47413	0	a	No
47414	0	a	because you want to be able to go up and down through the channels .
47415	0	a	Yeah people are going to have their favourite sorta , whether they do that or whether they
47416	0	a	Yeah yeah the mode switch .
47417	0	a	Ah ha okay .
47418	0	a	Okay , okay ,
47419	1	a	well then you just have , you have a diff you have a mode switch .
47420	0	a	Right .
47421	1	a	I think we will need a we will need a mode switch ,
47422	0	a	but then if we have a mode switch we are going to need some kind of indicator
47423	1	a	to which , an LE an LED
47424	0	a	okay .
47425	1	a	Just the lights behind the buttons .
47426	1	a	You could have back lit buttons maybe .
47427	0	a	Would that work ?
47428	0	a	Is that
47429	0	a	okay we have five minutes .
47430	0	a	Yeah .
47431	0	a	Okay .
47432	0	a	So right details th that we have talked about here are that we want a scroll wheel .
47433	0	a	We want a mode indicator .
47434	0	a	We want back lit buttons .
47435	1	a	And if we are making back lit buttons period , do we want that just for the mode indicator or maybe to indicate what button you are pressing at the time , so that you know if it is actually pressed or not .
47436	0	a	I have seen some remotes do that .
47437	0	a	Okay .
47438	0	a	Just so you know I think I mean it was my understanding that before we were going to stay in the mid market range .
47439	0	a	It seems we are kind of approaching a higher end range .
47440	0	a	Yeah yeah .
47441	0	a	I think we are yeah .
47442	0	a	I want to make sure everybody is okay with that .
47443	0	a	Well you had acknowledged that we have more money for this .
47444	0	a	Yeah well we do not have it is not that we have more money , we can push up the the price .
47445	0	a	Did not you say so ?
47446	0	a	That is what I mean .
47447	0	a	We can increase the cost .
47448	0	a	Yeah .
47449	0	a	Okay .
47450	0	a	So I do not know I do not know
47451	0	a	whether having
47452	0	a	Well I think th
47453	0	a	I think the design and technology has to come back and say , okay to create this product we see it is going to cost us this much for this volume , because we do have a volume target of of fifty million profit .
47454	0	a	Kay .
47455	0	a	I just want to make sure everybody is on board with it .
47456	0	a	So
47457	0	a	Right .
47458	0	a	Yeah .
47459	1	a	So we really need to be sure as to what we can push the cost up to ,
47460	0	a	though we have not got to a stage where we are ready to pin down the price of components .
47461	1	a	But I would say what sorta price are we looking to be able to sell something like that ,
47462	0	a	and what sorta price can we make it for ?
47463	0	a	Yeah no
47464	1	a	I
47465	1	a	I think that is where we really should be more flexible than anything else
47466	0	a	because as we said in the last meeting , our management is really looking for us to push our brand .
47467	0	a	We are entering a new market here ,
47468	0	a	so I think the the profit expectation for this one product is maybe not as important as being able to
47469	1	a	But th what is our ballpark as to what we would be able to sell something like this for ?
47470	1	a	But you have gotta think who our target market is
47471	0	a	because I I am not our target market .
47472	0	a	Okay I am I am okay with that .
47473	1	a	I guess what I just want to me the next step is for these guys to come come in with the design proposal w with the cost estimate attached , and then we have to take this to the next level .
47474	0	a	Well y
47475	0	a	yeah .
47476	1	a	Let is let is try and think now , how much would you pay for with all these features how much would you pay if you went to the store , and you were in the market f to replace your TV remote , how much would you pay for that ?
47477	0	a	I am just asking you .
47478	0	a	We have to find cost .
47479	0	a	I am a student , but on the other hand I would think , with my Project Manager salary , I would think
47480	0	a	yeah
47481	0	a	I could probably afford this
47482	0	a	would I buy it ?
47483	0	a	Maybe .
47484	0	a	If
47485	0	a	Then you could probably afford this .
47486	0	a	If I had a cool new TV and this was r looking really slick and it had the dock and it had the scroll wheel , which I think is a really cool idea , that would sell me on it a little .
47487	0	a	Then maybe you know .
47488	0	a	I do I do not think I would go over a hundred Euro certainly , that would be way too much ,
47489	1	a	but the I would be happy paying over forty for it , I guess , but not much
47490	0	a	Kay .
47491	0	a	Oh no no .
47492	1	a	I would say thirty five to forty .
47493	1	a	Yeah , I was going to say thirty five to fifty .
47494	0	a	Thirty five to fifty Euros is our sales bracket
47495	0	a	okay .
47496	0	a	Okay .
47497	0	a	So the question is what we ca we make it for .
47498	0	a	Because one of th one of the things we are marketing about this product is that this is the last one you will ever need to buy for your television .
47499	0	a	Right .
47500	0	a	It is one of the marketing features in this .
47501	0	a	That is why the scroll needs to be really robust .
47502	1	a	Okay so we will come up with something between thirty five and fifty that is rug rubber , robust , with scroll wheel , with the new facilities of the scroll wheel like favourite stuff , favourite channels , and and with a cradle , and
47503	1	a	yeah and the locator .
47504	0	a	With a cradle , radio transmitters , and back lit buttons .
47505	0	a	And it is going to look sexy .
47506	0	a	Or not .
47507	0	a	Or not .
47508	0	a	It might look like clay .
47509	0	a	Okay so you can market pe depending on that ?
47510	0	a	Cool .
47511	0	a	Yeah yeah .
47512	0	a	Bas th that is that is easy .
47513	0	a	That is that is not a , it is a .
47514	0	a	Cause we have about six , six , seven features in that alone .
47515	0	a	Yep .
47516	0	a	Under the title of uniquenesses .
47517	0	a	Okay .
47518	0	a	The next meeting starts in thirty minutes ,
47519	0	a	although does it ?
47520	0	a	It starts at three twenty one , the next meeting .
47521	0	a	So we have got more than a thirty minutes .
47522	0	a	we have got more like fifty .
47523	0	a	Well I have Is my
47524	0	a	three twenty one is the next meeting ?
47525	0	a	That is that is almost fifty minutes .
47526	0	a	The the ne next meeting is three twenty one
47527	0	a	yeah .
47528	0	a	Yeah that is .
47529	0	a	they have they have changed the times from the presentations .

47533	0	a	Thanks , yeah .
47534	0	a	Okay so you guys will be getting your modelling done now and
47535	0	a	Okay are there any other questions with regards to what this thing is going to do , look like , how it is going to work that need to be addressed before we really look at this in a lot of detail ?
47536	0	a	Okay .
47537	0	a	Yeah .
47538	0	a	I do not think so .
47539	0	a	Yeah I think it pretty much everything is covered .
47540	0	a	Okay .
47541	0	a	This one was quite easy .
47542	0	a	Coulda been worse .

47545	0	a	Thank you .

47559	0	a	Okay so we are here to talk about the detailed design of the product ,
47560	0	a	kay ?
47561	0	a	And here is the agenda for this meeting .
47562	0	a	Yep .
47563	1	a	I am just going to open , say a few boring words to start with again , and start taking minutes afterwards .
47564	1	a	You guys are going to give us a presentation of our wonder product

47567	1	a	And then we are going to evaluate it .
47568	1	a	Then we are going to talk about finance ,
47569	0	a	and I have got a lovely Excel spreadsheet that I knocked up in the last five minutes for this .
47570	0	a	Bra
47571	0	a	that is
47572	0	a	oh
47573	0	a	that is
47574	0	a	oh I like it .
47575	0	a	And
47576	0	a	yep .
47577	0	a	you knocked it up ?
47578	0	a	Thi third third third .
47579	1	a	And we are going to evaluate the product and close .
47580	0	a	Got forty minutes to do this in .
47581	0	a	We should be fine .
47582	1	a	Let is try and keep this one on schedule .
47583	0	a	Alright .
47584	0	a	So
47585	0	a	Your thing is in where is it ?
47586	0	a	Is it in
47587	1	a	Who wants it ?
47588	0	a	Zapping your favourite channels , eh ?
47589	0	a	Oh okay okay .
47590	0	a	Three , three .
47591	0	a	The end product thingy .
47592	0	a	Yeah .
47593	1	a	Pedro can have it .
47594	0	a	I like
47595	1	a	I will help talk .
47596	0	a	yeah
47597	0	a	so what we ended up with .
47598	0	a	Production costs estimated by our manufacturing department and the research department , which is us , is fifteen point eight Euros , someone forgot the units there yeah , unit price unit production price cost thing .
47599	0	a	Unit price .
47600	0	a	we implemented the basic functions , which is just TV functions plus the locator , which was one of the marketing things , cradle , scroll wheel for the the channels , and we implemented the f the the way of putting the new and revolutionary zapping , your favourite channels functionality , in the scroll .
47601	0	a	Yeah .
47602	0	a	Scrolling through your favourites list .
47603	0	a	Zapping you know zapping .
47604	0	a	kay
47605	0	a	okay , that is favourites .
47606	0	a	Maybe it is just a Portuguese thing .
47607	0	a	And yeah that was the result .
47608	0	a	kay .
47609	0	a	I like the the the the logo on there as well .
47610	0	a	It is very prominent .
47611	0	a	It is very prominent .
47612	0	a	So this is the
47613	0	a	Okay .
47614	0	a	So
47615	1	a	here I will give you the
47616	0	a	so this is the cradle unit , and this is the actual remote itself .
47617	0	a	so the scroll bar is or the scroll wheel is this this green little scrolly guy here , and then the volume controls are here and here .
47618	0	a	you have got the keypad which is the numbers f from zero to nine and then ten .
47619	0	a	This is the power button .
47620	0	a	we have our
47621	0	a	we have the enter button
47622	0	a	and what was the other button here ?
47623	0	a	This is the teletext .
47624	0	a	Start s the
47625	0	a	the start to to to
47626	0	a	programme
47627	0	a	yeah .
47628	0	a	The programme button ,
47629	0	a	yeah the programme button .
47630	0	a	, okay I see .
47631	0	a	So this bl this button will be used both for the favourites and for programming your the the type of television you want to use .
47632	0	a	So the plastic is the white area of this of the model here , and the red area is like a rubber covering .
47633	0	a	So you can see that when it lays like this or like this and the buttons are all going to be rubber , so it is pretty hard to actually damage it
47634	0	a	Yeah that might be a possible a mi possible problem , but if you drop it
47635	0	a	yeah .
47636	0	a	It is pretty cool .
47637	0	a	Is that
47638	0	a	could that be easy to for the scroll wheel to be rotated if it lands on it ?
47639	0	a	Oh well I guess it depends on the stiffness a little of it .
47640	0	a	Not helping .
47641	0	a	Yeah
47642	0	a	and it depends on if it is sliding ,
47643	0	a	but I think it is pretty ergonomic .
47644	1	a	You can feel it .
47645	0	a	Feels good .
47646	0	a	I take it that this is going to be slightly lighter in the final design as well .
47647	0	a	Yeah of course .
47648	0	a	Well this is clay .
47649	0	a	Yeah it is kind of cool .
47650	0	a	You have to reach a little bit do not you .
47651	0	a	Yeah the the power button is a bit of a reach ,
47652	1	a	but I think we might scale down the final model a bit .
47653	0	a	yeah that would not make sense .
47654	0	a	These this is a bit larger than it would be , but
47655	1	a	Pedro can demonstrate the the paging ability .
47656	0	a	It is cool .
47657	0	a	I am impressed .
47658	0	a	Do not have no one to handle that .
47659	1	a	And hold it so
47660	0	a	wh what is the marketing perspective ?
47661	0	a	Okay .
47662	0	a	I mean you guys gave me more than I was asking for , so I am happy because we have got some really marketable features in this .
47663	0	a	Yeah I think it is good .
47664	0	a	Good good good job .
47665	1	a	Yeah .
47666	0	a	So you ha you have like the the base station with the little button for the where is my remote .
47667	0	a	Beep beep beep .
47668	0	a	pla I am ha
47669	0	a	It is great .
47670	0	a	The locator function .
47671	0	a	That is great .
47672	0	a	It is a great feature .
47673	0	a	beep beep beep
47674	0	a	so
47675	0	a	beep beep beep beep beep beep
47676	0	a	be shut up .
47677	0	a	it is impressing .
47678	0	a	So let me get it ,
47679	0	a	if I press this button
47680	0	a	I see .
47681	0	a	That is pretty cool .
47682	0	a	Wicked is not it ?
47683	0	a	Ja .
47684	0	a	Hang on .
47685	0	a	So you can take this ho take this home with you tonight and you can push that and he will be across town
47686	0	a	, I can see that .
47687	0	a	Beep beep beep
47688	0	a	okay .
47689	0	a	I plan to do that as well .
47690	0	a	no no
47691	0	a	no tha that is alri
47692	0	a	Exactly that is exactly what those are for .
47693	0	a	So the the two blue are are those for the the it to charge off of in ?
47694	0	a	okay okay .
47695	0	a	And there is one other feature that we were debating , but we decided to go against it ,
47696	0	a	is you could
47697	0	a	beep beep beep
47698	0	a	we were thinking that it might be interesting to have a trigger button here because you have this finger
47699	0	a	it it is it kind of feels like there should be something there , but we could not figure out what button is important enough to put there .
47700	0	a	Yeah it is the right shape is not it ?
47701	1	a	But maybe if you had a trigger plus the scroll then that would get past the the problem of it landing and scrolling ,
47702	0	a	cause then it would need to be hit on both sides .
47703	0	a	And we we do not want to accidentally be hitting the power button like that so
47704	0	a	Right .
47705	1	a	So maybe in a final design phase we might tweak that a little bit ,
47706	0	a	but
47707	0	a	Okay .
47708	0	a	But it is definitely got options for like different types of models and things as well based on that ,
47709	0	a	has not it ?
47710	0	a	So is that the the final colour scheme as well or ?
47711	0	a	Okay .
47712	0	a	Yep I like .
47713	0	a	Good job .
47714	0	a	Oh no this is just what we had to work with at the time .
47715	0	a	No no .
47716	1	a	So we will leave the colour scheme up to the marketing people .
47717	0	a	The .
47718	1	a	Careful .
47719	0	a	It came off .
47720	0	a	The scroll wheels , a problem with them not being sort of
47721	0	a	I do not think the user interface guy wants to touch it anymore .
47722	0	a	Well I mean of course , I mean
47723	1	a	My my s my suggestion is we are going to go go to the silvers and blacks like most of the televisions .
47724	1	a	You know some blend of silvers and blacks .
47725	0	a	Beep beep beep .
47726	0	a	Okay enough of that .
47727	0	a	Well i it is cool guys .
47728	0	a	Kay so are we done with the this presentation ?
47729	0	a	Okay .
47730	0	a	Yeah .
47731	0	a	Now now .
47732	0	a	So you are not going to find my my folder up there
47733	0	a	I gotta do mine up at the board .
47734	0	a	Have you ?
47735	0	a	Okay .
47736	0	a	Yeah yeah .
47737	0	a	So
47738	0	a	No it is not in there because I had the computer problem
47739	0	a	and
47740	0	a	I I
47741	0	a	I cou
47742	0	a	I could not create it .
47743	0	a	Can I not get your get at stuff from your shared folder now ?
47744	0	a	Oh I see I see .
47745	0	a	I could not create it in the PowerPoint , and I think I have got this really strange cable .
47746	0	a	So what I had , basically going from the PowerPoint format , is that
47747	0	a	yeah
47748	0	a	yeah
47749	0	a	I like this a lot .
47750	0	a	Is this one of the tests is to see how we can adapt to s changing situations in the in the meeting room ?
47751	0	a	So what we had is we had the method .
47752	0	a	Nah .
47753	0	a	That is not how you spell method , is it ?
47754	0	a	No A .
47755	0	a	No way .
47756	0	a	So this does not go so fast this way .
47757	0	a	And when I speak about method I speak about the marketing of the product huh .
47758	0	a	And to me with this product we got we got basically three things to market .
47759	0	a	We have got the features , we have the characteristics ,
47760	0	a	and we have the
47761	0	a	I I do not know what we would call the other part
47762	0	a	what we call you know the the the corp corporate
47763	0	a	Help me .
47764	0	a	The the corporation stands behind the product , okay .
47765	0	a	So the features I think we got the scroll , we have got the the locator , we have got the durability , we have got the dependability , we have got you know the features that make this a unique product .
47766	0	a	It fell off .
47767	0	a	Beep beep beep .
47768	0	a	the characteristics I talk about , we have reliability , we have comfort ,
47769	0	a	we have ergonomics , we have environmentally s sensitive .
47770	0	a	and the corporation , we are talking about we are
47771	0	a	we are a new
47772	0	a	we are a new company .
47773	0	a	We are wanting to make a name for ourself .
47774	0	a	We are wanting you to find our product so we are going to give you a good product at a fair price .
47775	1	a	One thing I would want to to see is is can we can we get a lifetime guarantee on this product , a normal use guarantee ,
47776	0	a	which means that this product , for the for the life of of the life use , if it should have a technical problem , that we could re replace it at no cost ?
47777	0	a	That was something I would be interested in .
47778	0	a	so yeah
47779	0	a	without going into great details , we have a we have a product , it has the features and the characteristics , and the background , I believe , to make it marketable
47780	0	a	I believe at a cost of of of thirty thirty five to to fifty Euros .
47781	0	a	We are going to be competitive , and we are going to we are going to have a market niche .
47782	0	a	w
47783	0	a	That that would be that would be
47784	0	a	I think a decision best made by corporate
47785	0	a	I
47786	0	a	I m
47787	0	a	for my evaluation , based on what our competition is ,
47788	0	a	I th
47789	0	a	I think that that we can go after this and and and go after more of the exclusivity sense than the mass market sense .
47790	0	a	Do you
47791	0	a	would you a argue that that we are better going for the higher cost than bringing it down into twenty f five as we probably could , but lowering our profit margins ?
47792	0	a	kay .
47793	0	a	But I am sh
47794	0	a	I am sure open to to market this in either direction .
47795	0	a	But you guys came up with a great product , and at that cost I think it there is nobody else that is putting this this combination of of ingredients together .
47796	0	a	The only limitations I see to this is that we are focused on television only .
47797	0	a	that is the only that is the only drawback I see to this .
47798	0	a	But with all of these other features I think people c one thing I am
47799	0	a	I am hoping for is
47800	0	a	people are not going to even notice .
47801	0	a	There is going to be somebody going home and say
47802	0	a	oh sh this thing does not work for my DVD and
47803	0	a	my
47804	0	a	but I like these other things
47805	0	a	, so they keep it , they do not take it back .
47806	0	a	And we are actually quite open to be able to expand the product for a later version with those features quite simply anyway , are not we ?
47807	0	a	Th there is no fundamentally different technology to do that .
47808	1	a	Well one of one of the thoughts that I had is can can this unit be be produced in a way that makes it upgradable ?
47809	0	a	You know like like a a sim card in a in a in a telephone .
47810	0	a	You know is there a card in th
47811	0	a	can we make a card
47812	0	a	and so after
47813	0	a	but you follow what I am s
47814	0	a	I am s
47815	0	a	Yeah cause if if we can make this unit upgradable then we are
47816	0	a	yeah
47817	0	a	but then we talk about changing the warranty concept and everything , but that is that was just an idea I had .
47818	0	a	W we need we need we need s some more buttons if it would to work on some other stuff , but
47819	0	a	We we w yeah
47820	0	a	we could get another version of it that actually works .
47821	0	a	But
47822	0	a	Very co very colf colourful .
47823	0	a	to me the only additions
47824	0	a	Yeah .
47825	0	a	Yeah , the plus there is the the risk of making it unusable as well , or making it less
47826	0	a	b because at the moment it is actually very straightforward to look at all the buttons , you know what they do , it is very simple , and it just works .
47827	0	a	Yep .
47828	0	a	there is a risk of that .
47829	0	a	But anyway that is
47830	1	a	Okay so we can talk about finance now .
47831	0	a	So I have a little spreadsheet for us
47832	0	a	where
47833	0	a	I I was wondering , you
47834	0	a	when you talked about the fifteen point eight Euros , I was wondering how you came up with that figure ?
47835	0	a	Okay
47836	0	a	so I have bit of a spreadsheet here for this .
47837	0	a	Well , that was just just our technical team added up the production costs of the individual units .
47838	0	a	Oh .
47839	0	a	Now
47840	0	a	I have made a f few assumptions here in that I am assuming that our power adaptor we can make for a cost of four Euros , equivalent to solar cells , which I think is probably fair considering that we have in house manufacturing of power adaptors already .
47841	0	a	Uh huh .
47842	0	a	Uh huh .
47843	0	a	and I am assuming that the locator beacon , the you know the
47844	0	a	Can be made for
47845	0	a	it sounded different that time
47846	0	a	can be made for a similar price to an LC display ,
47847	0	a	an
47848	0	a	do you think that is fair coming from a m the manufacturing ?
47849	0	a	Yeah .
47850	0	a	beep beep beep .
47851	0	a	Oh , sorry .
47852	0	a	Yeah
47853	0	a	I do think we that we we do not need the events chip on print , we only need the the regular chip on print ,
47854	0	a	so there may have been a m miscalculation in there .
47855	0	a	Okay .
47856	0	a	Yep .
47857	0	a	Okay .
47858	0	a	So we are down to sixteen point four ,
47859	0	a	yeah .
47860	0	a	And we and we have a single curved
47861	0	a	I think that
47862	0	a	It is single curved ,
47863	0	a	yeah .
47864	0	a	Is that a single curved rather than a double curved ?
47865	0	a	We are not entirely sure what single curve versus double cur
47866	0	a	You think ?
47867	0	a	Okay I am convinced .
47868	0	a	We have got a we have got a curve and a droop .
47869	0	a	I do not know whether that .
47870	0	a	But we save one Euro that way ,
47871	0	a	yeah ?
47872	0	a	So we come bring it down to Fifteen point four .
47873	0	a	See it is a little bit more than f single curved .
47874	0	a	So yeah it is fifteen point eight , that is where we came up with it .
47875	0	a	Well hang on .
47876	1	a	Do do not speak so
47877	0	a	it is in here , in that
47878	0	a	w do we have any
47879	0	a	we have special form do not we ?
47880	0	a	So that is
47881	0	a	yeah .
47882	0	a	Okay .
47883	0	a	Yeah .
47884	0	a	Yeah we do .
47885	0	a	But the the the
47886	0	a	we have not talked about any special colour though
47887	0	a	I do not th
47888	0	a	if we are going for greys and silvers then I do not think we are
47889	0	a	O okay
47890	0	a	so we are
47891	0	a	Push button , scroll wheel , we are basically we have th
47892	0	a	is this intended to be a button as well or just a scroll ?
47893	0	a	Just a scroll ?
47894	0	a	It is not one of the scrolls where , for example , with this one you could push it down to be a button ?
47895	0	a	Okay
47896	0	a	then we have fifteen point eight Euros .
47897	0	a	What do you know .
47898	0	a	Oh it is a that is not very special , it is pretty
47899	0	a	If th .
47900	0	a	We do not
47901	0	a	It is a scroll .
47902	0	a	That is a scroll .
47903	0	a	no we just use it as a scroll .
47904	0	a	Ooh .
47905	0	a	It was a pretty accurate estimate I would say .
47906	0	a	It was not bad .
47907	0	a	Yes .
47908	0	a	We are wicked .
47909	0	a	Yeah .
47910	0	a	Awesome .
47911	0	a	Okay so we are on to the
47912	0	a	We are on to the pat on the back part of the presentation , where we have a look at the criterias th that Paul the criterion criteria that Paul has has given us , and we can use that to tell How is it going ?
47913	0	a	Anyone got any thoughts ?
47914	0	a	How how have we done today ?
47915	0	a	I think we did pretty well too .
47916	0	a	S is kind of s frighteningly accurate .
47917	0	a	Yeah .
47918	0	a	What ?
47919	0	a	I think we did pretty well .
47920	0	a	Yeah .
47921	0	a	That looks pretty spectacular .
47922	0	a	No , I think we come up with a with a attractive marketable product and and concept .
47923	0	a	Any other chang thoughts ?
47924	0	a	Okay so th th what about room for creativity ?
47925	0	a	Is it the .
47926	0	a	That was
47927	0	a	Yeah .
47928	0	a	Sh I think there was plenty of room .
47929	0	a	I
47930	0	a	I think we we ended up being quite creative there .
47931	0	a	We got a couple innovative i
47932	0	a	Couple innovative ideas .
47933	0	a	Yeah
47934	0	a	well we we we kind of broke
47935	0	a	we kind of at least adjusted every every criteria they gave us
47936	0	a	because we d we still have the the teletext capability in this thing right , we raised the price of it , we have added two t new technology to it .
47937	0	a	No .
47938	0	a	Yeah .
47939	0	a	So you know you know if this thing flies then we have we have adjusted or broken every every idea they gave us .
47940	0	a	Not every idea necessarily ,
47941	0	a	it is still a remote control .
47942	0	a	Basically .
47943	0	a	Yeah
47944	0	a	yeah
47945	0	a	yeah
47946	0	a	yeah .
47947	0	a	no
47948	0	a	yeah
47949	0	a	but we did we did break with the specs a little bit
47950	0	a	I guess ,
47951	0	a	but the
47952	0	a	Kay leadership , what do we report back to the bosses ?
47953	0	a	No th th
47954	0	a	I think they were r reasonably flexible with us over the whole changing the specs thing .
47955	0	a	But I like
47956	0	a	I mean when I say we have we had
47957	0	a	I believe we have room for creativity cause
47958	0	a	w this is we did it .
47959	0	a	It was more of a teamwork thing then really leadership based project was Teamwork .
47960	0	a	Yep .
47961	0	a	I agree .
47962	0	a	Cohesive yeah .
47963	0	a	Synergy .
47964	0	a	Yes synergistic
47965	0	a	yeah .
47966	0	a	There was a lot of synergy .
47967	0	a	Teamwork ,
47968	0	a	yeah he is .
47969	0	a	Yeah .
47970	0	a	What did we think of the meeting room ,
47971	0	a	I guess is an important thing here .
47972	0	a	These cables suck .
47973	0	a	Yeah , this falls off and the white board worked really well without any pro
47974	0	a	Mm mm , lapel .
47975	0	a	Yeah .
47976	0	a	Yep .
47977	0	a	And that is
47978	0	a	D you must have very long shirts .
47979	0	a	Yeah .
47980	0	a	That is way far down lapel mic .
47981	0	a	Wha okay , oh , alright .
47982	0	a	Lapel lapel lapel .
47983	0	a	Lapel .
47984	0	a	That is almost a crotch mi cr
47985	0	a	Oh dear
47986	0	a	oh dear .
47987	0	a	That is it is down , it is quite close .
47988	0	a	You know you know what they are going to have on the recording in there from that microphone is your lunch digesting
47989	0	a	you know th
47990	0	a	New ideas f for the product or for the the the the environment or
47991	0	a	what are we ta
47992	0	a	Oh .
47993	0	a	Keep it , keep it calm .
47994	0	a	Oh dear .
47995	0	a	No more pizza for me .
47996	0	a	So yeah the the pen came in alright and it is a little uncomfortable to use
47997	0	a	but I guess it works .
47998	0	a	Cause this is you were using it o upside down .
47999	0	a	Still that
48000	0	a	Use them like that .
48001	0	a	That is our boss .
48002	0	a	Nah , I am I am not convinced of that at all .
48003	0	a	I have been wor I have been wondering about that all day ,
48004	0	a	but see these look like they are
48005	0	a	that looks the oth that looks like it would be that way around , but it feels more comfortable , wh what you call upside down .
48006	0	a	Pedro is right .
48007	0	a	Pedro is right .
48008	0	a	I do not care .
48009	0	a	okay so that data might be slightly invalid .
48010	0	a	What new ideas have we found ?
48011	1	a	Well let is do both then .
48012	0	a	Oh wel
48013	0	a	Well we had the favourites list , and the scroll bar , and we have the cradle , and the r remote call feature .
48014	0	a	for the product ?
48015	0	a	Yeah we came up with quite a bit .
48016	0	a	Bunch of new ideas .
48017	0	a	And for the meeting room , Has anyone got any more
48018	0	a	Yeah less sore on the ears .
48019	0	a	Yeah comfortable headsets would be nice .
48020	0	a	Well I I mean
48021	0	a	clearly remote control microphones would be the would be a nice solution to all these cables , but I am sure that there is there is some justification for these things that I do not know about .
48022	0	a	And of course I did not have so much fun with my computer this afternoon .
48023	0	a	It is not been it is not been cooperating so well , but I do not think that is the that is avoidable .
48024	0	a	Coulda been worse .
48025	0	a	Okay so
48026	0	a	Are the costs within the budget ?
48027	0	a	Nope .
48028	0	a	n no .
48029	0	a	No .
48030	0	a	Oh hang on it really
48031	0	a	that is something we that the costs were under twelve fifty Euros .
48032	0	a	No requirements are changed .
48033	0	a	We are still under twenty Euros to build , so we are good .
48034	0	a	And the costs within the budget ?
48035	0	a	Not the original budget , but they are now .
48036	0	a	Is the project evaluated ?
48037	0	a	I think so yeah , then celebration as it says .
48038	0	a	Hooray .
48039	0	a	Okay .
48040	0	a	Free coke provided at the cafeteria .
48041	0	a	All right .
48042	0	a	Oh I do not know how that got there .
48043	0	a	anyway .
48044	0	a	Who wrote that one ?
48045	0	a	Thank
48046	0	a	Thanks guys .
48047	1	a	So we need to close this meeting ,
48048	0	a	yeah bravo .
48049	0	a	Congratulations .
48050	0	a	S I have got a lot of paperwork to catch up on
48051	0	a	Yeah , I have got a lot of paperwork to catch up on too .
48052	0	a	 
48053	0	a	So
48054	0	a	we can start ?
48055	0	a	Suppose I have to do my presentation .
48056	0	a	Yeah .
48057	0	a	okay .
48058	0	a	Eh
48059	0	a	So ,
48060	1	a	I will present myself ,
48061	0	a	I am Ada Longmund , and as you may know it , I am the pr project manager .
48062	0	a	It is Ada Longmund ?
48063	1	a	Maybe someone ha we have to this whiteboard ,
48064	0	a	yeah ?
48065	0	a	Yeah ,
48066	0	a	I do not know .
48067	0	a	So
48068	1	a	we will have to speak about m the project .
48069	0	a	Our project project is to create a new remote control and as you may know there is lot of industrials interesting in creating a remote control , so the remote control has to be original , trendy and user friendly .
48070	0	a	Record .
48071	0	a	So
48072	0	a	the project method is the following .
48073	0	a	So
48074	0	a	if we are the functional design , you have to do any individual work and also work with meetings talking with each other .
48075	0	a	it will be the same for the conceptual design and also the same for the detailed design .
48076	0	a	The tool training is to try out the white board ,
48077	0	a	so
48078	0	a	Maybe you can draw your favourite animal and make a list of its favourite characteristics .
48079	0	a	So
48080	0	a	right now ?
48081	0	a	I do not know if we have to do it now , maybe later later .
48082	0	a	So
48083	0	a	yeah
48084	0	a	I think you can do it .
48085	0	a	So
48086	0	a	the selling price of the product will be twenty five Euros .
48087	0	a	Twenty five Euros ?
48088	0	a	Yep .
48089	0	a	Yeah .
48090	0	a	Yeah .
48091	0	a	I think it is quite good price ,
48092	0	a	yeah .
48093	0	a	I it is it is reasonable ,
48094	0	a	s quite
48095	0	a	yeah .
48096	0	a	It is reasonable , I think , yeah .
48097	0	a	Twenty five .
48098	0	a	And
48099	0	a	it will be a an international remote control , as we want to sell it in the entire world , and the product costs will be not more than twelve Euros and fifty centimes .
48100	0	a	Is
48101	0	a	Yeah .
48102	0	a	So ,
48103	1	a	as you will discuss about the remote control you will have to experience your with the remote control .
48104	1	a	just maybe be imaginative with remote const con controls , try to create something new
48105	0	a	and people would like to to buy .
48106	0	a	And and the next meeting will start in thirty minutes ,
48107	0	a	so
48108	0	a	you will ha all have your spethisfispis specif specific role
48109	0	a	and you know I suppose you know what you have to do .
48110	0	a	And
48111	0	a	you will have to work on the design and also to work on the design of th technical fun functions of the remote control and think of the user requirement specifications .
48112	0	a	I I hope so
48113	0	a	ID is for the Industrial Design ,
48114	0	a	yeah ?
48115	0	a	And UID , it is for the User Interface Designer ,
48116	0	a	yeah ?
48117	0	a	AMI
48118	0	a	yeah
48119	0	a	project .
48120	0	a	Those things just refer to each of each of us , I think .
48121	0	a	Yeah .
48122	0	a	AMI
48123	0	a	and
48124	0	a	okay .
48125	0	a	ID ,
48126	0	a	yeah .
48127	0	a	Yeah .
48128	0	a	So So
48129	0	a	I will manage all all the group .
48130	0	a	Okay .
48131	0	a	That is me .
48132	0	a	Okay ,
48133	0	a	and Marketing Expert , it is me .
48134	0	a	you will be the manager yeah
48135	0	a	You can manage all this , yeah .
48136	0	a	Okay .
48137	0	a	Good .
48138	0	a	So
48139	0	a	you have questions ?
48140	0	a	So
48141	0	a	you all know what the parts of the work you have to do .
48142	0	a	Not really .
48143	0	a	Yeah .
48144	0	a	So
48145	0	a	which
48146	0	a	you , the Industrial Designer .
48147	0	a	No I am user interf I am user interface design .
48148	0	a	I am the Industrial Design ,
48149	0	a	yeah
48150	0	a	I am the Industrial Designer so .
48151	0	a	Okay .
48152	0	a	And you ?
48153	0	a	okay .
48154	0	a	Okay .
48155	0	a	Yeah .
48156	0	a	So
48157	0	a	what is the difference between user interface design d industrial design ?
48158	0	a	Yeah , I think so .
48159	0	a	I mean , you have to know .
48160	0	a	, you have to know it .
48161	0	a	It is difficult .
48162	0	a	It is your job ,
48163	0	a	so I hope you you know what it is .
48164	0	a	You know very soon .
48165	0	a	So
48166	0	a	I I think the user the user interface design is he will design how the user will you know the relation between the user
48167	0	a	and you know the remote control
48168	0	a	so And the industrial design , it is how the object will look like .
48169	0	a	I suppose you have to design it
48170	0	a	and you have to take care of the industrial way to transform it .
48171	0	a	Okay ,
48172	0	a	so I make u user interface .
48173	0	a	Yeah .
48174	0	a	You you de you implement the core functions in the Use it .
48175	0	a	And i maybe you will transform it .
48176	0	a	Make make
48177	0	a	yeah .
48178	0	a	Maybe I think i industrial design is , it is the function design .
48179	0	a	Yeah .
48180	0	a	So
48181	0	a	the materi
48182	0	a	Okay right .
48183	0	a	I design the user f user interface , you design the function .
48184	0	a	Maybe , it is the outside and the inside .
48185	0	a	Yeah .
48186	0	a	Okay .
48187	0	a	Okay .
48188	0	a	But I was thinking that he is a user
48189	0	a	cause the user interface to design for example where the but button will be , you know .
48190	0	a	Yeah yeah .
48191	0	a	But I do not know .
48192	0	a	Okay .
48193	0	a	Well .
48194	0	a	You know .
48195	0	a	I am the industrial designer .
48196	0	a	Oh , okay , okay .
48197	0	a	Not the other one .
48198	0	a	So .
48199	0	a	Okay .
48200	0	a	Okay .
48201	0	a	So
48202	0	a	and the marketing expert will
48203	0	a	Ok Okay .
48204	0	a	Yeah ,
48205	0	a	I am just go
48206	0	a	I am trying to give you some trends about what should be done and what the users would like to have
48207	1	a	and then thi this would I guess converged to the User Interface Designer wi and then Industrial Designer .
48208	0	a	And
48209	0	a	yeah .
48210	0	a	And when designing y the remote control just remember that it has to be a kind of international product .
48211	0	a	Okay .
48212	1	a	So you do not have to do something really specific ,
48213	0	a	as everybody everybody will have to use it , it is sor the same as keyboards .
48214	0	a	Yeah .
48215	0	a	You know , you have Qwerty , Azerty , French and UK keyboard , so really the remote control to be international .
48216	0	a	Yeah .
48217	0	a	Okay .
48218	0	a	And not too expensive .
48219	0	a	Yeah .
48220	1	a	And simple .
48221	0	a	As we want to maximise the benefit .
48222	0	a	And easy to use .
48223	0	a	And you have to keep it under twelve Euros and f fifty , so .
48224	0	a	Yeah ,
48225	0	a	you have to keep in mind that the product cost wo not be maxim more than twelve dot fifty Euros .
48226	0	a	, yeah .
48227	0	a	That is the problem .
48228	0	a	It should be
48229	0	a	There was a step about drawing something in the in the board ,
48230	0	a	I do not know .
48231	0	a	Okay .
48232	0	a	Okay .
48233	1	a	And to be sure that really people will be interested in buying a new remote control with maybe new functionalities that do not exist in the existing remote controls now .
48234	0	a	Okay .
48235	0	a	So ,
48236	0	a	is it okay ?
48237	0	a	So
48238	0	a	you think we have to do it now ?
48239	0	a	You want me to draw something ?
48240	0	a	Product manager
48241	0	a	okay ,
48242	1	a	let is go ,
48243	1	a	I will try .
48244	0	a	Yeah .
48245	0	a	It is clear .
48246	0	a	Yeah ,
48247	1	a	maybe should go and draw an animal .
48248	0	a	Is it ?
48249	0	a	Are we supposed to do right now ?
48250	0	a	Oh right
48251	0	a	it is it is from the left to the ri It is
48252	0	a	I d I was thinking but I n I am not sure now .
48253	0	a	Yeah yeah ,
48254	1	a	you try .
48255	1	a	Try first .
48256	1	a	You can draw something which is very simple .
48257	0	a	Oh
48258	0	a	Everybody
48259	1	a	I think everybody should do it ,
48260	0	a	so .
48261	0	a	Oh ,
48262	1	a	maybe we should bring Kemy here .
48263	0	a	Kemy is really good at drawing .
48264	0	a	Many
48265	0	a	Yeah .
48266	0	a	It is not matter So .
48267	0	a	You are going to draw ?
48268	0	a	Okay .
48269	0	a	it is the same as mine .
48270	0	a	yeah .
48271	0	a	It is a It is a cat .
48272	0	a	What is this ?
48273	0	a	It is a fat cat .
48274	0	a	It is not a fat cat .
48275	0	a	It is the fat cat , okay .
48276	0	a	Yeah , it is a
48277	0	a	Yes
48278	1	a	you have to draw a rat if you want a rat .
48279	1	a	Can you draw rabbit ?
48280	0	a	Oh ,
48281	0	a	hat ha
48282	1	a	rat .
48283	0	a	A rat ?
48284	0	a	That is difficult .
48285	0	a	Yeah .
48286	0	a	No .
48287	0	a	A mouse is not too difficult .
48288	0	a	It is your rat .
48289	0	a	Mouse is okay .
48290	0	a	Yeah , it is okay .
48291	0	a	Yeah .
48292	1	a	Just go ,
48293	0	a	you you the closest to the whiteboard .
48294	0	a	Okay ,
48295	1	a	go
48296	0	a	right , but in grow , it is
48297	0	a	everybody has to grow
48298	0	a	What are you I don
48299	0	a	no idea , so
48300	0	a	It is a rabbit .
48301	0	a	Jus

48303	0	a	Okay .
48304	0	a	Oh .
48305	0	a	Okay ,
48306	1	a	I draw .
48307	0	a	The only thing I can draw is like this .
48308	0	a	Oh .
48309	0	a	Oh .
48310	0	a	Oh .
48311	0	a	A duck .

48325	0	a	It is not so bad
48326	0	a	so .
48327	0	a	The only thing I can draw , because it is very simple .
48328	0	a	Okay .
48329	1	a	I go .
48330	0	a	What ?
48331	0	a	Oh .

48338	0	a	Thank you .
48339	0	a	A fish .
48340	0	a	That is a that is a fish ?
48341	0	a	Okay ,
48342	1	a	let is try to draw something .
48343	0	a	You forgot the chips .
48344	0	a	Oh yeah , does not look so fine .
48345	0	a	Have to be really careful .
48346	0	a	Fish and chips .
48347	0	a	Okay ,
48348	1	a	it is your turn .
48349	0	a	it is my turn .
48350	0	a	Oh .
48351	0	a	Okay ,
48352	1	a	be careful .

48358	0	a	It is ok
48359	0	a	So ,
48360	1	a	what can I draw some more ?
48361	0	a	No .
48362	0	a	Oh yeah .
48363	0	a	Yeah ,
48364	0	a	it is it is a se

48382	0	a	yeah .
48383	0	a	Yeah .
48384	0	a	Okay .
48385	0	a	Just have to present project , discuss a little bit about it .
48386	0	a	So
48387	0	a	we have break .
48388	0	a	Oh ,
48389	0	a	we have twenty five minutes for the meeting .
48390	0	a	Yeah .
48391	0	a	Okay .
48392	0	a	So ,
48393	0	a	if you have questions .
48394	0	a	Oh .
48395	0	a	Know what time is it ?
48396	0	a	No .
48397	0	a	No .
48398	0	a	It is okay ?
48399	0	a	You know your job ?
48400	0	a	you know your job ?
48401	0	a	You know your job ?
48402	0	a	Yeah , it is okay .
48403	0	a	We have an idea
48404	0	a	yeah .
48405	0	a	I have an idea of my job
48406	0	a	so yeah so .
48407	0	a	 
48408	0	a	So ,
48409	1	a	I will open our functional design meeting .
48410	0	a	So ,
48411	1	a	I will play role of the secretary .
48412	1	a	As also Program Ma Manager .
48413	0	a	So ,
48414	0	a	we will have the three presentations from the In Industrial Designer , User Interface Designer and
48415	0	a	What is your talk ?
48416	0	a	Marketing Experts .
48417	0	a	Industrial Design .
48418	0	a	Marketing Expert .
48419	0	a	Okay .
48420	0	a	And after that we will have the new product requirements , the decision on the remote control functions , and we will close the meetings after .
48421	0	a	so
48422	1	a	I suppose the first to do the presentation will be the User Interface Designer .
48423	0	a	Okay .
48424	0	a	, so you are participant two ?
48425	0	a	No
48426	0	a	you are
48427	0	a	No ,
48428	0	a	I am participant one .
48429	0	a	One one .
48430	0	a	No no no .
48431	0	a	One .
48432	0	a	Three three , it is three
48433	0	a	sorry .
48434	0	a	I I think I am a .
48435	0	a	Okay , never mind .
48436	0	a	Okay .
48437	0	a	Kay ,
48438	0	a	did you save your presentation ?
48439	0	a	Is not that technical functions ?
48440	0	a	Name is Jordan .
48441	0	a	In one .
48442	0	a	In one ,
48443	0	a	sorry .
48444	0	a	Yeah .
48445	0	a	No sure .
48446	0	a	So you did not save it maybe .
48447	0	a	It is mine .
48448	0	a	it is David Jordan .
48449	0	a	Alright , so
48450	0	a	David Jordan ? .
48451	0	a	Course .
48452	0	a	So
48453	1	a	so I will I let David Jordan do his presentation .
48454	0	a	yeah .
48455	0	a	Okay .
48456	1	a	No , no .
48457	1	a	this one does not want to be moved , I think .
48458	0	a	Too great for email then .
48459	0	a	Okay , so .
48460	1	a	The first I will present the technical function design for user interface for our remote TV control .
48461	0	a	Yeah .
48462	1	a	I I will focus on user interface design .
48463	1	a	so move to the next slide .
48464	0	a	As we know our remote c rem remote TV control it is very has very soph sophisticated functions , as we show from this picture .
48465	0	a	There is a lot of functions .
48466	0	a	Over , I think over s twelve or twenty s functions of a remote TV control .
48467	1	a	So how can we design a user interface with so sa with so many sophisticated functions ?
48468	1	a	, let is move to next slide .
48469	0	a	Yeah .
48470	0	a	So
48471	0	a	I
48472	0	a	so we want to design elegant , easy to use inter interface .
48473	0	a	A very good example is Google .
48474	0	a	As we know Google it is a very successful because his powerful function ,
48475	0	a	but with very easy to use user interface .
48476	0	a	so
48477	1	a	move to next s slide .
48478	1	a	So my job is to design a Google TV controller which I want to have sophisticated functions while with very easy to use user interface .
48479	0	a	So
48480	0	a	That is the end of the talk the end of the presentation .
48481	0	a	So you propose to to have the remote control which will be powerful .
48482	0	a	With sophisticated functions ,
48483	0	a	but with very
48484	0	a	yeah powerful .
48485	0	a	So powerful , many functions and very easy to use .
48486	0	a	Yes .
48487	0	a	Yep .
48488	0	a	So ,
48489	0	a	I dunno , it is maybe difficult to have both , I mean the the one on the right does not look so simple
48490	0	a	Yeah .
48491	0	a	To merge the two system huh .
48492	0	a	Yeah .
48493	0	a	You mean this one ?
48494	0	a	Yeah you have to learn the manual before using this remote control , I suppose .
48495	0	a	Yeah .
48496	0	a	yep .
48497	0	a	But But this is
48498	0	a	Yeah .
48499	0	a	But if we have very very good user interface it take less time for user to learn how to use it .
48500	0	a	Yeah ,
48501	0	a	and then
48502	0	a	Yeah .
48503	0	a	Yeah
48504	1	a	you maybe you have some international standards , where you know , if you can use one is the other are or almost the same , so the sign .
48505	0	a	Oh
48506	0	a	you mean for the yeah pic pictograms or things like that ?
48507	0	a	Yeah
48508	0	a	such as maybe the Go on , go back
48509	0	a	and
48510	0	a	So ,
48511	0	a	you will propose us something which is
48512	0	a	yeah
48513	0	a	so powerful and easy to use .
48514	0	a	Yeah ,
48515	0	a	yeah .
48516	0	a	For example , I dunno here , escape , you know , you have escape in computers you have , so if you see escape , you know that it should be the same .
48517	0	a	Oh it should okay ,
48518	0	a	yeah .
48519	0	a	So you have to The sh the user there
48520	0	a	for example the power off button it is something very international ,
48521	0	a	you know that
48522	0	a	So .
48523	0	a	The user should know .
48524	0	a	Yeah .
48525	0	a	So .
48526	0	a	Yeah ,
48527	1	a	but the question is how to merge you know the Google system to the system , alright .
48528	0	a	Yeah ,
48529	0	a	that is going to be the trick .
48530	0	a	Yeah ,
48531	1	a	that is my job .
48532	0	a	That is your job
48533	0	a	It you
48534	0	a	Okay , okay .
48535	1	a	That is my job .
48536	0	a	It is not the easiest I have got to .
48537	0	a	Yep .
48538	0	a	Okay .
48539	0	a	Okay .
48540	0	a	Powerful and easy to use .
48541	0	a	So that is the point .
48542	0	a	Yeah , that is the point .
48543	0	a	So ,
48544	1	a	next I propose the Industrial User Interface to present things .
48545	0	a	So you you are
48546	0	a	Participant two .
48547	0	a	Yeah .
48548	0	a	Okay .
48549	0	a	The rationale must be design , or
48550	0	a	So
48551	1	a	we can move to the next slide .
48552	0	a	So ,
48553	0	a	Baba is the the Industrial Designer .
48554	0	a	Okay .
48555	0	a	As you all know , you know m
48556	0	a	my job is to design you know to give an industrial design of the remote control .
48557	1	a	So the re basically the remote control will be , you know , infrared control ,
48558	0	a	so the problem is how to relate the how to relate the remote control device , like for example this one I h
48559	0	a	I am holding in my hand and the TV .
48560	0	a	So ,
48561	0	a	this one is leather bu based
48562	1	a	but I propose a nifra infrared base
48563	0	a	you know , so so
48564	0	a	for me I think that it is better it is bet it is better to control TV
48565	0	a	so you know , so
48566	0	a	it is it will be cheaper and it is less technology than , you know
48567	0	a	For the cheap price we have , for the cheap price we want to
48568	0	a	I think it is cheaper than laser , so .
48569	0	a	True .
48570	0	a	So you mean that infrared control is a cheap technology ?
48571	0	a	Yeah .
48572	0	a	Okay .
48573	0	a	Do y you know the requirements for the remote control ?
48574	0	a	Twelve , nearly thirteen
48575	0	a	, yeah .
48576	0	a	What the cost is ?
48577	0	a	Twelve , twelve a half .
48578	0	a	The cost
48579	0	a	Yeah ,
48580	0	a	I think for the cost we want for the cost we want it is better to have
48581	0	a	Let is see .
48582	0	a	Yeah .
48583	1	a	You can move to the next slide , so .
48584	0	a	So the di the differen the findings
48585	0	a	you know
48586	0	a	what you find inside the re i
48587	0	a	the the system here inside it is just , you know a bulb and an infrared bulb , so here for example the infrared bulb will be here and the bulb it will be somewhere inside .
48588	0	a	That might just So .
48589	1	a	You can go to the next slide .
48590	0	a	Okay .
48591	0	a	I have some kind of pictures
48592	0	a	you know ,
48593	0	a	here .
48594	0	a	You have the b the bulb , it is a blue the blue stuff here and the infrared and the infrared bulb it is the red stuff
48595	0	a	you know and so
48596	0	a	and you have the other subcomponent
48597	0	a	that are not really here so important , so .
48598	0	a	Yeah .
48599	0	a	What is this ?
48600	0	a	Okay .
48601	0	a	This is in fact some other component that are in between the electrical de the electronic device .
48602	0	a	Look .
48603	0	a	But here what I wanted to emphasise it is just you know the bulb
48604	0	a	and .
48605	0	a	Okay .
48606	0	a	So
48607	1	a	and the next slide ,
48608	0	a	it is the last one
48609	0	a	it is So it is
48610	1	a	I think it should be wire wireless re remote con
48611	0	a	Because you know , it is easier to manage
48612	0	a	and you know because you f the b the the battery problem can hold you know
48613	0	a	will you use a battery or the a wire to connected you .
48614	1	a	Or maybe some kind of thing that we can have both ,
48615	0	a	but you know , I at my side prefer a wireless .
48616	0	a	Okay .
48617	0	a	Okay , so
48618	0	a	if you have some question I did not answer ?
48619	0	a	Well
48620	0	a	the avera the average prices
48621	0	a	I think that this technology will cost , I dunno , around eight Euros , so .
48622	0	a	Okay .
48623	0	a	What is the average price of this technology then ?
48624	1	a	But this is what you would like to ask the user first
48625	0	a	and I do not think the user would be ready to have a
48626	0	a	I do not think well ,
48627	0	a	yeah ,
48628	0	a	I do not think he would ,
48629	0	a	but in a sense
48630	0	a	The wire ?
48631	0	a	Yeah .
48632	0	a	Or at least you know , the You would
48633	0	a	yes , you can .
48634	0	a	So what , the wireless remote control ?
48635	0	a	There is a wire with remote control ?
48636	0	a	Okay .
48637	0	a	It is so so bres
48638	0	a	you have to decide how how you will you know , put some energy inside ,
48639	0	a	so
48640	0	a	you can think about wireless
48641	0	a	or you know
48642	0	a	it is it is a question that we can raise , so .
48643	0	a	We can think that you know , with the wire , you know , without a wire .
48644	0	a	We can have both also .
48645	0	a	So you think that a cable between the remote control and the TV wo not be a good idea .
48646	0	a	Okay .
48647	0	a	Okay .
48648	0	a	No
48649	0	a	it wou
48650	0	a	maybe it will be cheaper
48651	0	a	I dunno
48652	0	a	, I just may maybe you making a solu
48653	0	a	Yeah ,
48654	0	a	but
48655	0	a	Yeah
48656	0	a	but as Industrial Designer , do you think that it will be feasible to have linked or to have link between the remote control and the television ?
48657	0	a	I am just asking you .
48658	0	a	Wireless remote control .
48659	0	a	Yeah ,
48660	0	a	but some pa I always want to have you know ,
48661	0	a	sometime I want to have wire
48662	0	a	because you know .
48663	0	a	Do you think it will be cheaper ?
48664	1	a	Could you answer please ?
48665	0	a	Okay .
48666	0	a	, I do not think it will be too much .
48667	0	a	Okay .
48668	1	a	Have to think about the question ,
48669	0	a	you know ,
48670	0	a	cause it is I think that you know
48671	0	a	you can always you know
48672	0	a	I think wha wha with the wire it is cheaper
48673	0	a	but you know the wireless
48674	0	a	it is more practical , so .
48675	0	a	Yeah ,
48676	0	a	but I think the wireless problem is more the David Jordan is problem .
48677	0	a	As it is
48678	0	a	yeah .
48679	0	a	True .
48680	0	a	Okay , yeah .
48681	0	a	I think it is more your problem .
48682	1	a	Mayb maybe you have just to to kind of research or try to ask people if they will like something wireless or not .
48683	0	a	that is my job .
48684	0	a	That is the Now the
48685	0	a	Yeah .
48686	0	a	Okay ,
48687	0	a	I am sorry .
48688	0	a	So So
48689	1	a	just think of the usability .
48690	0	a	Yeah
48691	1	a	but , it should be an agreement ,
48692	0	a	you know ,
48693	1	a	because even if you can think of the wireless , it is it is it is the job of the the the g Graphical User Designer ,
48694	0	a	but you know .
48695	0	a	If it is a lot cheaper and if you want to reach for example some the the money you have , if you want to use , so it can be good to have a wireless ,
48696	0	a	it it is a question .
48697	0	a	Okay .
48698	0	a	Design a wireless remote control .
48699	0	a	Yeah .
48700	1	a	Just think of the problem .
48701	0	a	If when you have wireless remote control and if you lose it ?
48702	0	a	I think it is would be easier to have a link between the remote control and the television ,
48703	0	a	yeah .
48704	0	a	Yeah .
48705	0	a	Well
48706	0	a	that is actually one of the point ,
48707	0	a	yeah ?
48708	0	a	True .
48709	0	a	This you will see in my presentation then .
48710	1	a	So I will let you to do your presentation , so .
48711	0	a	Yeah .
48712	0	a	Okay .
48713	0	a	Which is participant four .
48714	0	a	So just trying to answer all the questions ,
48715	0	a	if the user would be happy to have something or something else .
48716	0	a	We have made a study ,
48717	1	a	so could you go to next slide .
48718	0	a	Sorry for the functional recurrence .
48719	0	a	So that is the standard method for marketing ,
48720	0	a	okay .
48721	0	a	We had one hundred subjects , , we observe their remote control use in a lab and then after all the experiments they had to fill up a questionnaire , , and see what was okay or not for them .
48722	1	a	Okay .
48723	0	a	So then it is some statistics about what we observed and what they answered .
48724	0	a	actually seventy five percent of the users find m the most remote controls ugly ,
48725	0	a	okay ,
48726	0	a	so that is
48727	0	a	Yeah , the the look is is bad for them
48728	0	a	so
48729	1	a	it is your job , David , maybe .
48730	0	a	You mean the loo the look , the outside ?
48731	0	a	Okay .
48732	0	a	The look , how it look like .
48733	0	a	Then eighty percent of users would spend more money actually if if the remote controls were not so ugly .
48734	1	a	So this is where we could have yeah , good market , I guess , if people are ready to pay more .
48735	0	a	Yeah .
48736	0	a	So
48737	0	a	it is it is interesting information , I think .
48738	0	a	And then yeah , the remote controls like the one you have shown previously it is not so does not fit the user requirements sometime , because it is too many buttons and so on .
48739	0	a	So
48740	1	a	we should change this as well .
48741	0	a	And users are actually zapping a lot , so they are using the device intensively ,
48742	1	a	that is something to take into account as well .
48743	0	a	And , you know ,
48744	0	a	ten percent of the buttons are actually used in the remote control .
48745	0	a	And this is one of the main point for me .
48746	1	a	But I will come back to it later .
48747	0	a	Kay .
48748	1	a	Could you go next slide ?
48749	0	a	, so as you said , remote controls are often lost somewhere in the room .
48750	0	a	So
48751	0	a	this is from the experiments we have done ,
48752	0	a	so if we could solve this problem this would be interesting for the user , I think .
48753	0	a	it takes too much time to learn how to use the remote control for thirty five percent of the people .
48754	0	a	And remote control are really bad for RSI problems for twenty six percent of the users .
48755	0	a	What is RSI ?
48756	0	a	okay .
48757	0	a	RSI is like , when you are using the same doing the same movement several times , then you get injured .
48758	0	a	Yeah .
48759	0	a	Okay ?
48760	0	a	So ,
48761	0	a	those numbers are less important then the previous one ,
48762	1	a	but still it has to be taken to count .
48763	0	a	So
48764	1	a	last slide .
48765	1	a	so my pres personal preferences for this problem is we have to meet the user needs .
48766	1	a	If we can make it look fancy then we might sell more than our concurrent ,
48767	0	a	okay .
48768	0	a	Okay .
48769	1	a	And definitely if it could have less buttons , still maybe the same number of functions , but less buttons ,
48770	0	a	this would definitely be a good way of selling more .
48771	0	a	Functions .
48772	0	a	Okay .
48773	0	a	Okay .
48774	0	a	So
48775	0	a	Yeah ,
48776	1	a	remember
48777	0	a	the user is not happy to read the manual .
48778	0	a	okay .
48779	0	a	And just to have an idea , do you think you as the User Interface Designer to would it be possible to have less buttons and still have the same functionality and to have powerful remote control , you think it is possible ?
48780	0	a	Sure ?
48781	0	a	Yeah ?
48782	0	a	Yeah .
48783	0	a	Yeah .
48784	0	a	Yeah , I think possible .
48785	1	a	Because we can We can mix several function in one button .
48786	0	a	So lets you then you have less buttons .
48787	0	a	Yeah ,
48788	0	a	but do you think it will be easy to use ?
48789	0	a	Because if you have many functions just for one button it would be quite difficult for the user to know .
48790	0	a	But I am not sure
48791	0	a	No
48792	1	a	you you can have a switch menu ,
48793	0	a	so you can
48794	0	a	well
48795	0	a	for example
48796	0	a	Yeah , I think so .
48797	0	a	Yeah ,
48798	0	a	I think the
48799	0	a	Yeah ,
48800	1	a	but it has to be intuitive .
48801	0	a	The manuals .
48802	0	a	It is
48803	0	a	Yeah .
48804	1	a	Like for for example you can you can category the function i i into several classes .
48805	1	a	Then for you can have a switch menu , so you put the switch menu to it
48806	1	a	it tend to this kind of this category of functions .
48807	0	a	Yeah , okay .
48808	0	a	Okay ,
48809	0	a	but
48810	0	a	Yeah ,
48811	0	a	but
48812	1	a	Then you you put the switch button , then it switch to another category of functions .
48813	1	a	Yeah .
48814	0	a	For example , if you have remote control
48815	0	a	you you can rem you can control your TV and also you can control your recorder .
48816	0	a	With a
48817	0	a	Look fancy .
48818	0	a	So there is a different functions , but i if you you there is a button you can switch between control TV and control your recorder .
48819	0	a	So we can has less buttons .
48820	0	a	But what I am not so sure is about how to make the remote control look funny look fancy , not funny .
48821	1	a	This is a question that should be asked to the If you ask the people , maybe the the marketing people .
48822	0	a	Because different people have a different opinion about fancy .
48823	0	a	You know .
48824	0	a	Yeah ,
48825	0	a	this is something we sh
48826	0	a	But this was first step and
48827	0	a	This was the first step , yeah .
48828	0	a	Because maybe a colourful is fancy for some people , but maybe simple and uniform colourful is fancy for some for other peoples , so .
48829	1	a	I think the solution is to have many colours of you know instead of having one grey standard
48830	0	a	Yeah , yeah , maybe .
48831	0	a	Yeah ,
48832	0	a	but I think it will increase the price of the production of the remote control .
48833	0	a	Specially distribution , yeah .
48834	0	a	Yeah , maybe .
48835	0	a	If you need to have special colours for remote controls it will cost more .
48836	0	a	Yeah ,
48837	0	a	but this is what we would ask to the users , so .
48838	0	a	Yeah , personalised colour .
48839	0	a	Because you know
48840	0	a	Yeah ,
48841	0	a	because maybe some people prefer a red remote control , some people prefer black remote control .
48842	0	a	Yeah , it will cost little bit more .
48843	0	a	Yeah ,
48844	0	a	yeah ,
48845	0	a	yeah .
48846	0	a	And also f
48847	0	a	Yeah ,
48848	0	a	but as soon as you speak about options , it means that the price increases ,
48849	0	a	and we do not really want the price to be too too high , because we want to be able to produce it .
48850	1	a	Maybe we can have di di we can have several options ,
48851	0	a	so user can select which colour they prefer , so .
48852	0	a	Yeah .
48853	0	a	Yeah ,
48854	0	a	remember it is twelve Euros .
48855	0	a	So ,
48856	0	a	we want something fancy , as previously said , Florent , something very easy to use , powerful and also as it is written here , seventy five percent of users , they zap lot ,
48857	0	a	so maybe just having many functions in one button is not that good if you want to zap a lot .
48858	0	a	And they do not really want to zap between functions of their remote control , they want to zap between channels on TV .
48859	0	a	So
48860	1	a	I think you have quite lot of points to to think about and to discuss it with the other members .
48861	0	a	Yeah .
48862	0	a	Yeah , .
48863	0	a	Yeah .
48864	0	a	So ,
48865	0	a	is it okay for your presentation ?
48866	0	a	Nothing else to to add ?
48867	0	a	Yeah , it is done ,
48868	1	a	just yeah .
48869	1	a	If we would if we could remember like , not too many buttons and make it look fancy , I think it would make it .
48870	0	a	Okay .
48871	0	a	so
48872	0	a	So ,
48873	0	a	I had some new information about the product requirements ,
48874	1	a	so you will have to take care of it of it in your thinking , in your designing of the remote control .
48875	0	a	So .
48876	0	a	So
48877	0	a	the first one is that for the designing of the remote control we do not really want to use the teletext anymore ,
48878	0	a	as it is something that is
48879	0	a	It is is
48880	0	a	No
48881	0	a	yeah ,
48882	0	a	because now everybody has internet at home ,
48883	0	a	so it is better to use internet then teletext .
48884	0	a	Lame ,
48885	0	a	or
48886	0	a	Yeah .
48887	0	a	Yeah .
48888	0	a	So ,
48889	1	a	you will have to think about it in your in in the design of your remote control ,
48890	0	a	and also the remote control will only be used for television ,
48891	0	a	so
48892	0	a	for y for you your designing , you are not you wo not be
48893	1	a	you wo not had buttons to just to manipulate yeah to control the recorder or maybe the garage door or things like that .
48894	0	a	Yep .
48895	0	a	Control .
48896	0	a	It is
48897	0	a	because if we want to to do remote control which will be used for for the television , for the recorder , for the camcorder and all the others , it will become too complex and it will increase the pli the price
48898	0	a	and we ca not do that .
48899	0	a	We really want to focus on the remote control for the television .
48900	0	a	Is it okay ?
48901	1	a	So maybe it will be easier for you to to design it , to have very powerful and easy .
48902	0	a	Okay .
48903	0	a	But there is balance between function and the cost .
48904	0	a	Yeah .
48905	0	a	Okay .
48906	0	a	And also we want the image of the real reaction be recognisable in the product , such as the colour and s the slogan .
48907	0	a	I mean that is if you want to buy a remote control
48908	0	a	and if you go in a shop and if you see the remote control you will recognise directly that s it is our product .
48909	0	a	Mm hm .
48910	1	a	So you will have to use the colour of the product , of the of the of real reaction
48911	0	a	and also
48912	0	a	Yeah .
48913	0	a	Okay .
48914	0	a	Okay .
48915	0	a	So .
48916	0	a	So has to be yellow .
48917	0	a	Yellow .
48918	0	a	As we say , we put the fashion in electronics ,
48919	1	a	so it has to be a fashion remote control .
48920	0	a	Okay .
48921	1	a	Fancy , fashion , powerful , easy to use .
48922	0	a	Require lot of requirements ,
48923	0	a	but
48924	0	a	Yeah .
48925	0	a	Yeah .
48926	0	a	For cheap remote control , yeah .
48927	0	a	And cheap .
48928	0	a	A low cost .
48929	0	a	Yeah .
48930	1	a	But that is your your job to find something matches .
48931	0	a	Yeah .
48932	0	a	Yeah ,
48933	1	a	cause what I am thinking is how will you will connect the TV to internet , so .
48934	0	a	This is
48935	0	a	Yeah ,
48936	0	a	but this
48937	0	a	this mean that your TV would be able to , you know , connect to internet , you know , surf the web .
48938	1	a	I do not think it is part of the remote control design anyway .
48939	0	a	Maybe not ,
48940	0	a	but mayb
48941	0	a	So .
48942	0	a	It is maybe more in browsing .
48943	0	a	Yeah ,
48944	0	a	there is that box in o of it .
48945	0	a	Yeah .
48946	0	a	A pi
48947	0	a	There is that box in the TV , so with the set box you you can connect internet with your TV .
48948	0	a	Okay .
48949	0	a	Ok
48950	0	a	It is It is not so popular now .
48951	0	a	Hm mm .
48952	0	a	It is pop
48953	0	a	I do not think it is popular ,
48954	0	a	so that is the problem so .
48955	0	a	You had i if you are designing a remote control for you know the global usage , so if people do not have the technology .
48956	0	a	Global ,
48957	0	a	okay .
48958	0	a	So everybody is okay with the new requirements ?
48959	1	a	I think it has to be yellow .
48960	0	a	So I I so
48961	1	a	As as for the colour , what what do you think ?
48962	0	a	Yellow ?
48963	0	a	TV remote control ?
48964	0	a	Okay .
48965	0	a	Yellow ?
48966	0	a	Do you think that people like the colour yellow ?
48967	1	a	I think if you have you know th like a yellow ribbon here is the double R .
48968	0	a	Yeah .
48969	0	a	Min
48970	0	a	Yeah .
48971	1	a	Maybe you can change the colour ,
48972	0	a	but the image of the society has to be recognised .
48973	0	a	Okay .
48974	0	a	Why you go
48975	0	a	It has to be fashion .
48976	1	a	Or should be .
48977	0	a	Yeah , so .
48978	1	a	Does not need to be completely yellow ,
48979	0	a	but just .
48980	0	a	Okay .
48981	0	a	So you have to
48982	0	a	Yeah .
48983	0	a	It has to be a fashion and really be the image of the society .
48984	0	a	Just when you enter you say oh , oh , it is real reaction .
48985	0	a	Think it is a re reaction remote control , so .
48986	0	a	Okay , okay .
48987	0	a	Okay .
48988	1	a	And also it has to be attractive , of course ,
48989	0	a	because if you want to sale to sell the remote control .
48990	0	a	It is okay ?
48991	0	a	Yeah .
48992	0	a	Regarding the first line , what So we are just expecting no more use of the teletext .
48993	0	a	And that is it .
48994	0	a	Yeah .
48995	0	a	But I dunno , but why ,
48996	0	a	nobody is a threat to me .
48997	0	a	It is already changed for
48998	0	a	I think it would be simpler .
48999	0	a	Okay .
49000	0	a	So
49001	1	a	I will close the meeting ,
49002	0	a	just after that we will have lunch break .
49003	0	a	And you will have in thirty minutes individual work .
49004	0	a	Y you
49005	0	a	You will have as the ID
49006	0	a	I do not remember what is industr Industrial Designer to put pon
49007	0	a	yeah ,
49008	0	a	and the User Interface Designer to work on the user interface concept .
49009	0	a	Industrial Designer ,
49010	0	a	yeah .
49011	0	a	Industrial Designer .
49012	0	a	Component component , yeah .
49013	0	a	Okay .
49014	0	a	And Florent to work my subject .
49015	0	a	Yep .
49016	0	a	And so specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach .
49017	0	a	Okay .
49018	0	a	It is okay ?
49019	0	a	I think the session is closed .
49020	0	a	Good .
49021	1	a	And by the way , Mister David Jordan , please record your presentations in your own folder .
49022	0	a	Okay .
49023	1	a	Not in mine .
49024	0	a	 
49025	0	a	So
49026	1	a	let is start our second me meeting on conceptual design .
49027	0	a	So ,
49028	0	a	as the previous meeting I will be the secretary and we will have three presentations and we will have to decide on the remote control concept and finally we will close the decision .
49029	0	a	So
49030	1	a	I will first
49031	0	a	What ?
49032	1	a	I I think I will let our User Interface Designer speak first , Mister David Jordan .
49033	0	a	No y you do the minutes first ,
49034	0	a	or ?
49035	0	a	No ?
49036	0	a	Okay .
49037	0	a	Yep .
49038	0	a	So , we will S
49039	0	a	technical accessoire ?
49040	0	a	Interface ?
49041	0	a	This .
49042	0	a	Yeah .
49043	0	a	No no no .
49044	0	a	Yeah .
49045	0	a	So
49046	1	a	first I will present the concept of user interface .
49047	0	a	there is three concepts in the user interface .
49048	0	a	So first one it is a Google controller .
49049	0	a	The second is a fancy controller .
49050	0	a	The last one is intelligent controller .
49051	0	a	So there are three concepts in our controller .
49052	1	a	n next I will explain one by one ,
49053	0	a	the first is Google controller .
49054	0	a	, so
49055	1	a	I want the controller to be easy to use , but with sophisticated functions .
49056	0	a	So it is a combination of easy to use and sophisticated functions .
49057	0	a	this is a first concept of our controller .
49058	0	a	The second concept is a fancy controller ,
49059	0	a	so
49060	0	a	we want give the customers the impression that our controller is very attractive , they can easy recognise our controller among a lot of products ,
49061	0	a	so so
49062	1	a	the u the user f the the u user interface should be very very cute , very very g attractive .
49063	1	a	A nice one .
49064	0	a	Such like this , there are several examples in the slides .
49065	0	a	I am not sure the one in the middle is very attractive .
49066	0	a	Yeah ,
49067	0	a	it is very ,
49068	0	a	you know
49069	0	a	if you are
49070	0	a	Yeah .
49071	0	a	It is very big ,
49072	0	a	yeah .
49073	0	a	It is hard
49074	0	a	f
49075	0	a	i
49076	0	a	it is easy for you to remember it .
49077	0	a	Or to recognise it , yeah .
49078	0	a	Okay .
49079	0	a	Yeah , why not .
49080	0	a	Yeah .
49081	0	a	Yeah .
49082	1	a	We will have big discussion I suppose after that ,
49083	0	a	so .
49084	0	a	Yeah .
49085	0	a	Yeah .
49086	0	a	Yeah .
49087	0	a	So
49088	0	a	the last concept is intelligent .
49089	0	a	We want we want our controller to be smart ,
49090	1	a	so maybe we should use technology , such as speech recognition technology and gesture recognition technology , so we need to have coop some cooperation with some research institute on speech recognition and gesture recognition .
49091	0	a	With this advanced features we I think we can attract a lot of user .
49092	0	a	Okay .
49093	0	a	Okay .
49094	0	a	Something else ?
49095	1	a	I just have one question ,
49096	0	a	because for the intelligent controller , you said that we can use the voice recognition or the gesture recognition , but as the expert told us , most of the people want to use the remote control to zap t to zap between channels .
49097	0	a	No .
49098	0	a	There
49099	0	a	this is the three concepts of our controller .
49100	0	a	Yeah .
49101	0	a	Yeah .
49102	0	a	Yeah .
49103	0	a	Yeah , so
49104	0	a	Y
49105	0	a	I think some time it is very convenient to use voice interface and gesture interface than use button .
49106	0	a	Do you think they will be able to use gestures ?
49107	0	a	Because , if they do all the time the same gesture , as you said previously in the last meeting , maybe they will get injuries because of that ?
49108	0	a	or if you say channel three channel three two three four six five , I think they will be bored after a while .
49109	0	a	Yeah .
49110	0	a	Maybe .
49111	0	a	You do not think so ?
49112	0	a	Yeah , sure .
49113	0	a	For example , if you cannot find your controller , you can just just just speak something such as , yeah , one two .
49114	0	a	I
49115	0	a	That is true .
49116	0	a	Oh yeah , that is a good that is a good point , so .
49117	0	a	One and
49118	0	a	Yep .
49119	0	a	Yeah ,
49120	0	a	but suppose you got a cold .
49121	0	a	You have a mute remote controller .
49122	0	a	Yeah .
49123	1	a	So you can use your gesture .
49124	0	a	That is no problem .
49125	0	a	Yeah
49126	0	a	but how how is how risky is it to trust like speech recognition or gesture recognition ?
49127	0	a	Okay .
49128	1	a	Broken arm ?
49129	0	a	Yeah ,
49130	0	a	but suppose you have a family watching TV , and if they want to use their private remote control in the same time , do you think it will work ?
49131	0	a	Everybody wanting to change channel in the same time ?
49132	0	a	Why ?
49133	0	a	If you have one brother and one sister and they want to watch their favourite TV programme , so they say oh channel four channel three channel four channel three all the time ,
49134	0	a	so .
49135	0	a	For limited vocabulary speech recognition is very reliable and for s limited vocabulary gesture recognition is also very
49136	0	a	Yeah .
49137	0	a	Okay .
49138	0	a	But this this but this would never happen anyway .
49139	0	a	Yeah ,
49140	0	a	they cannot speak at the same time .
49141	0	a	Yeah
49142	0	a	Yeah ,
49143	0	a	but the
49144	0	a	Yeah
49145	0	a	but this
49146	0	a	Yeah .
49147	0	a	Yeah
49148	0	a	but Yeah
49149	0	a	but the same can happen even with it you know this kind of remote control
49150	0	a	because the
49151	0	a	That is right .
49152	0	a	Yeah ,
49153	0	a	it is very interesting .
49154	0	a	Yeah .
49155	0	a	I do not think it
49156	0	a	Oh , okay , okay ,
49157	0	a	you mean it could be a problem for this kind of stuff .
49158	0	a	Yeah ,
49159	0	a	but you have the remote control , so maybe you can keep it f with you .
49160	0	a	You are not you are not obliged to share it .
49161	0	a	Yeah ,
49162	0	a	we can
49163	0	a	yeah .
49164	0	a	Yeah ,
49165	0	a	that is that is the advantage of intelligent controller .
49166	0	a	Even you h you have the controller , I can I can say channel three , so it is c come to channel three ,
49167	0	a	I do not have to
49168	0	a	It is advantage .
49169	0	a	No .
49170	0	a	It is it is
49171	1	a	And mayb maybe we can have the switching mode to pass from you know voice controller to manual controllers , eh .
49172	0	a	No , but this is disadvant disadvantage .
49173	0	a	Yeah , I think it is a disadvantage .
49174	0	a	Yeah .
49175	0	a	Yeah ,
49176	1	a	but one other question .
49177	0	a	How how much will it cost ?
49178	0	a	Yeah .
49179	0	a	No ,
49180	0	a	more expensive maybe .
49181	0	a	How much ?
49182	0	a	No no
49183	0	a	we
49184	0	a	we d
49185	0	a	we we just are use
49186	0	a	No no
49187	1	a	we just have some cooperation with some research institute ,
49188	0	a	we do not have to do some basic research on this field .
49189	0	a	Because I suppose we need to do research to have something working .
49190	0	a	if you if if you use the basic
49191	0	a	But it is it is changing how the remote control is going to be built .
49192	0	a	Some some efficient .
49193	0	a	So
49194	0	a	you think it wo not cost an Not a lot for us ?
49195	0	a	Or ?
49196	0	a	Yeah ,
49197	0	a	but
49198	0	a	Mm mm .
49199	0	a	Yeah ,
49200	0	a	I think it is
49201	0	a	because this technology is for limited wor or limited wor lexical recognition ,
49202	0	a	it is very it is
49203	0	a	yeah .
49204	0	a	It is
49205	0	a	No
49206	0	a	it is Even for the f because the the vocabulary the
49207	0	a	The vocabulary is very small ,
49208	0	a	so that is not a problem .
49209	0	a	Because then you need
49210	0	a	I mean this does not have the power to do recognition , for example .
49211	0	a	Well
49212	0	a	y y you have also the language problem ,
49213	0	a	you know
49214	0	a	when you
49215	0	a	Cause it
49216	0	a	it have to be universal ,
49217	0	a	so .
49218	0	a	Yeah .
49219	0	a	I agree with
49220	0	a	Yeah ,
49221	0	a	but there is one problem that Baba talked about is the international remote control .
49222	0	a	Yeah .
49223	0	a	Yeah .
49224	0	a	Yeah .
49225	0	a	We need something that is international .
49226	0	a	Suppose we are we want to sell it in France .
49227	0	a	Yeah .
49228	0	a	The recognition system will be able to understand French .
49229	0	a	If you want to go to England , it will be able to understand English ,
49230	0	a	so .
49231	0	a	Yeah .
49232	0	a	Yeah ,
49233	1	a	the key , the key the key of our the key feature of our controller is that it is it has some some adaptation mechanism .
49234	0	a	Yeah ,
49235	1	a	this could be downloaded by the web maybe ,
49236	0	a	or
49237	0	a	Yeah .
49238	0	a	Yeah
49239	0	a	but you know .
49240	0	a	The product
49241	0	a	The pro
49242	0	a	It is a very smart , it is a very smart controller maybe
49243	0	a	Oh yeah
49244	0	a	yeah
49245	0	a	yeah
49246	0	a	yeah .
49247	0	a	It is It is it means when you when you sell this controller in China
49248	0	a	it is can recognise Chinese .
49249	0	a	It is r if you sell this controller in France it can recognise French .
49250	0	a	, okay .
49251	0	a	Yeah ,
49252	0	a	it is
49253	0	a	Because of this product this technology has already been developed .
49254	0	a	And with no increase in the pri production price of the remote control ?
49255	0	a	Yeah ,
49256	0	a	but how will you
49257	0	a	Oh .
49258	0	a	But
49259	0	a	Yeah
49260	0	a	but the problem is how to s
49261	0	a	you know
49262	0	a	if this is a push button controller , you can send this con this remote control everywhere in the world , the same one .
49263	0	a	So
49264	0	a	Yeah .
49265	0	a	Yeah .
49266	0	a	If you have the language , you have to develop for each country .
49267	0	a	Oh
49268	0	a	n
49269	0	a	Yeah ,
49270	0	a	yeah
49271	0	a	tha that is why we have to do language adaptation .
49272	0	a	Yeah ,
49273	0	a	but for each country you have to do one ,
49274	0	a	because the for example for Se
49275	0	a	Oh really ?
49276	0	a	That is Comple
49277	0	a	A microphone maybe .
49278	0	a	Yeah .
49279	0	a	Even for each f for even for different family we have to do d
49280	0	a	yeah
49281	0	a	we would we have to do adaptation to
49282	0	a	No , it is not so complex .
49283	0	a	Yeah ,
49284	0	a	but then w
49285	0	a	Yeah ,
49286	0	a	we have to take care of the twelve Euros problem .
49287	0	a	Seems to be quite complex .
49288	0	a	And what about voice recognition , do we have microphones ?
49289	1	a	And where will be they ?
49290	0	a	Do you think if we are far from television it will work ?
49291	0	a	Yeah ,
49292	0	a	but where is the controller ?
49293	0	a	Yeah .
49294	0	a	No no no
49295	0	a	it is not
49296	0	a	I think that is n that is not a problem because you you do not have to wear a microphone .
49297	0	a	It it just the microphone is embedded in the controller .
49298	0	a	Okay .
49299	0	a	Where is the controller ?
49300	0	a	It is in your family , in your home .
49301	0	a	No ,
49302	0	a	but then it is it is like this
49303	0	a	Yeah .
49304	0	a	Yeah ,
49305	0	a	but we are
49306	0	a	here it is an object .
49307	0	a	But here you say you want to use i s technology .
49308	0	a	Yeah .
49309	0	a	Yeah
49310	1	a	you can you can embed it microphone here .
49311	0	a	Yeah ,
49312	0	a	but wha what is the use of voice or gesture recognition if you have a remote control li like this , if you have an object .
49313	1	a	If you want to use voice or gesture you need to be free , without any object .
49314	0	a	To talk to the to the TV maybe .
49315	0	a	You just want to interact with television .
49316	0	a	Yeah yeah
49317	1	a	just you just put the controller here , then you you use your command and you do s your gesture .
49318	1	a	I if you say one , he switch to channel ,
49319	0	a	yeah .
49320	0	a	Yeah ,
49321	0	a	but you can lose it .
49322	0	a	No no
49323	0	a	it is n y if you lose it
49324	0	a	Yeah .
49325	0	a	So well
49326	1	a	for example if it is somewhere in the room if i maybe if it is in the table there you can always say s channel one and the t the remote control gives the order to the TV to switch to channel one .
49327	0	a	Okay
49328	1	a	you so you can build a kind of black box and put it on TV and just to recognize gestures and voice .
49329	0	a	Devic
49330	0	a	Yeah .
49331	0	a	Yeah .
49332	0	a	Yeah
49333	0	a	but so you need a camera
49334	0	a	and you know a microphone inside your remote control .
49335	0	a	Yeah .
49336	1	a	But you would still have the buttons .
49337	0	a	Or is it
49338	1	a	do you think it should be only voice recognition and gesture recognition ?
49339	1	a	Or you you still have the possibility to use buttons ?
49340	0	a	Okay ,
49341	0	a	so you
49342	0	a	yeah .
49343	1	a	think it we should give the flexibility to the user
49344	0	a	and we think
49345	0	a	yeah .
49346	0	a	Yeah ,
49347	1	a	You can see they can switch form one modality to another .
49348	0	a	Yeah ,
49349	0	a	I dunno .
49350	0	a	It is a bit risky risky .
49351	0	a	Yeah .
49352	0	a	I think so .
49353	0	a	No , that is quite inter quite attractive .
49354	0	a	And maybe it will be quite
49355	0	a	Okay .
49356	0	a	But I think that , you know , switching from one country to to another will be a problem ,
49357	0	a	so although y y
49358	0	a	Yeah
49359	0	a	but i i
49360	0	a	Yeah , we should .
49361	0	a	Well ,
49362	0	a	if you do language adaptation , there should be no problem .
49363	0	a	Yeah ,
49364	0	a	I dunno .
49365	1	a	We should have confidence in technology .
49366	0	a	So ,
49367	0	a	what do you think ?
49368	1	a	We will try the controllers you would prefer .
49369	0	a	What ?
49370	0	a	If if
49371	0	a	I mean ,
49372	0	a	I am sure if the user pays the same price , he is happy to have recognition .
49373	0	a	Which kind of controller would you prefer to use , you as a remote control user ?
49374	0	a	So
49375	1	a	I think it would be better not to do any intelligent controller and to stay with the Google controller or a fancy controller .
49376	0	a	More features ,
49377	0	a	yeah .
49378	0	a	But if if if it like doubles no one would would be interested .
49379	0	a	Yeah , but
49380	0	a	I think he need a control that is very reliable ,
49381	0	a	so .
49382	1	a	Maybe try to mix the Google controller and the fancy controller ?
49383	0	a	Just want to have something controller which is in a kind of intelligent controller , easy to use , sophisticated and fancy .
49384	0	a	Yeah .
49385	0	a	Yeah .
49386	0	a	Yeah
49387	0	a	but if if you stick to stick to the first two parts .
49388	0	a	You think it is possible ?
49389	0	a	Yeah ,
49390	0	a	but we want so
49391	0	a	Yeah ,
49392	0	a	but w we we want something th that works all the time , every day , every hour , for everyone .
49393	0	a	So what is the difference between our controller with other products in the market ?
49394	0	a	There is no k features of our controller , so is there is there any necessary to design new controller without any breakthrough features ?
49395	0	a	Would y would you replace your controller with a controller with similar function if you do not have some some function inside it that
49396	0	a	Yeah ,
49397	0	a	you y that is a fun that is not the function of the controller
49398	0	a	, that is a function of TV .
49399	0	a	Yeah .
49400	0	a	Yeah .
49401	0	a	No ,
49402	0	a	I mean
49403	0	a	Y
49404	0	a	No ,
49405	0	a	but you need you need new remote controller then .
49406	0	a	It is not really the we
49407	1	a	we can add for example some function like for browsing in internet , so or something like that .
49408	0	a	But I think a user need Do not have a the the
49409	0	a	Yeah
49410	0	a	if we can send email from it .
49411	0	a	You can replace your TV with a new TV with internet browsing function ,
49412	0	a	but
49413	0	a	Okay .
49414	0	a	Because if you want to browse internet or , I do not know , if you want to type something ,
49415	0	a	or
49416	0	a	No .
49417	0	a	But it is not the only the problem only the issue of controller , it is it is also the issue of the TV .
49418	0	a	No .
49419	0	a	Because the p the problem I can see with with the voice or the gesture itself wh what can happen in a family i i for example
49420	0	a	if
49421	0	a	Yeah
49422	0	a	And for all the person of the family maybe ,
49423	0	a	so ,
49424	0	a	yeah .
49425	0	a	Cause for example
49426	0	a	yeah .
49427	0	a	Yeah ,
49428	0	a	but we do we do we
49429	0	a	we
49430	0	a	we cannot rely one hundred percent on these features to u to use the controller ,
49431	0	a	but with the features of our controller such as you have the feature of voice recognition in your mobile but you seldom use it , your mobile , but you when you choose a new mobile , you choose the one with voice recognition .
49432	0	a	Yeah .
49433	0	a	Yeah ,
49434	0	a	you wou you would
49435	0	a	True .
49436	0	a	That is
49437	0	a	the feature is not one hundred percent reliable , but it is a feature to distinguish our product from our from other products .
49438	0	a	Yeah .
49439	0	a	Yeah ,
49440	0	a	Yeah ,
49441	0	a	if if if if you are if you ar if you already have a product it works one hundred percent reliable , would you replace it with another one ?
49442	0	a	Yeah .
49443	0	a	You do not need to tune it .
49444	0	a	Yeah , why not ?
49445	0	a	If it is
49446	0	a	Not too expensive too .
49447	0	a	I mean , for example the goo
49448	0	a	y
49449	0	a	you say we would we would to have a Google like controller .
49450	0	a	Because you have new
49451	0	a	Okay .
49452	0	a	Yeah .
49453	0	a	I do not see how adding speech or gesture recognition would make the remote control look more like Google .
49454	0	a	Google is is simple , works fine ,
49455	0	a	so I I guess if can have a remote control that is really basic , simple and works fine , it is already a lot .
49456	0	a	Yeah .
49457	0	a	Yeah .
49458	0	a	Oh yes ,
49459	0	a	but there is no big difference between the traditional controller .
49460	0	a	thi this I mean ,
49461	0	a	the user is not only interested in having speech or gesture recognition
49462	0	a	or
49463	0	a	if he has something that works fine and is really fancy , looks nice and it is easy easy to use , easy to use .
49464	0	a	The then nn
49465	0	a	no .
49466	0	a	Tha
49467	0	a	But the there is there is
49468	0	a	n there is n not enough motivation for them to replace their old controller with a new one if there is no key feature in the new controller .
49469	0	a	See
49470	0	a	That is the problem , yeah .
49471	0	a	That is the same
49472	0	a	yeah .
49473	0	a	I mean , I I know it is more interesting to develop a remote controller with speech and gesture and whatever .
49474	0	a	Yeah .
49475	1	a	But you have to think , the user is the one who going to buy the product
49476	0	a	and so .
49477	0	a	Yeah .
49478	0	a	Okay .
49479	0	a	I mean , that is the point .
49480	0	a	So
49481	1	a	let is go to the Industrial Designer .
49482	0	a	Okay .
49483	1	a	Maybe we will be able to take a decision after that ,
49484	0	a	so .
49485	0	a	Okay .
49486	0	a	Yeah .
49487	0	a	Two ?
49488	0	a	Working ?
49489	1	a	I can
49490	0	a	Okay .
49491	0	a	Yeah , participant two
49492	0	a	Yeah , working design ,
49493	0	a	so .
49494	0	a	So
49495	0	a	I think
49496	1	a	Can you go to the next one ?
49497	0	a	I
49498	0	a	it is not this one .
49499	0	a	It is oth the oth
49500	0	a	so I
49501	0	a	It is the working design .
49502	0	a	Sorry .
49503	0	a	Component design .
49504	0	a	It is okay
49505	0	a	I think there is something wrong with your
49506	0	a	Maybe you you record it somewhere else .
49507	0	a	So this
49508	0	a	yeah
49509	0	a	so this is the described use
49510	0	a	What ?
49511	0	a	Are you inst
49512	0	a	I do not think so .
49513	0	a	It did did not r receive it .
49514	0	a	Did not receive it .
49515	1	a	Participant one .
49516	1	a	Participant one .
49517	0	a	Interface concept .
49518	0	a	No .
49519	0	a	Oh .
49520	0	a	Maybe I record recorded directly on the Computer .
49521	0	a	Yeah .
49522	0	a	Dunno .
49523	0	a	Nope .
49524	0	a	Okay , okay .
49525	0	a	Yes .
49526	0	a	It seems that we have a problem with the
49527	0	a	Yeah ,
49528	1	a	so
49529	0	a	No , I think it will be more interesting to start with
49530	0	a	Yeah .
49531	0	a	I dunno if you remember what you had to say
49532	0	a	or
49533	0	a	I think it is more interesting what he says , okay .
49534	0	a	I can say it to you without .
49535	0	a	Yeah ,
49536	1	a	maybe we can first come to to Frahan .
49537	1	a	With Frahan , then you can prepare your slides , then present it later .
49538	0	a	Yeah ,
49539	0	a	exac
49540	0	a	Okay .
49541	0	a	You will had s some more information in
49542	0	a	I think it will be interesting after your presentation to have Baba is presentation .
49543	0	a	Yeah .
49544	0	a	Yeah , true .
49545	0	a	Yeah .
49546	0	a	Okay .
49547	0	a	In fact , I do not know ,
49548	0	a	I s
49549	0	a	because i in my presentation I do not have here with
49550	0	a	so
49551	0	a	It was in fact the design use to show you the design of what is inside a what is inside and what are the different component of the r of the remote control .
49552	0	a	So .
49553	1	a	Okay .
49554	0	a	Okay , never mind .
49555	0	a	Okay .
49556	0	a	Okay .
49557	0	a	So it will be interesting so I could show you some some picture of what is inside
49558	0	a	and so .
49559	0	a	Okay .
49560	0	a	So
49561	0	a	I in fact the the f
49562	1	a	something I want to discuss is which kind of material are we going to use ,
49563	0	a	so
49564	0	a	will it will be wooden wooden di wooden remote control or a a plastic remote control like this one .
49565	0	a	So and
49566	1	a	in which which which kind will be the the different bu button ,
49567	0	a	so
49568	1	a	it can be some , you know , classic pushbutton like this one , or you have also some button like LCD where you know , the button the buttons are unlighted during the night , or , you know , you can see them in the darkness .
49569	0	a	Okay .
49570	0	a	Okay .
49571	1	a	And the other thing I want to discuss also is which kind of alimentation , electric alimentation do you want to have ,
49572	0	a	so will it be for example d solar energy alimentation or will it be a battery like the classical battery
49573	0	a	so .
49574	0	a	Uh huh .
49575	1	a	And I think that for example for the alimentation it would be good to have both of them ,
49576	0	a	so so
49577	0	a	for example in some country where you are in the the countryside and you are far from , you know , the cities for example in some place in in S Senegal , so if you have electric if you have solar alimentation , you just , when you want to have recharger or remote control power you just put it on the sun and after one hour you can come
49578	0	a	and so it can be interesting for people to have this kind of remote con
49579	0	a	It can be something interesting to make people buy it , for example .
49580	0	a	Yeah , I think it is an added value to the remote control
49581	0	a	and maybe it can attract all the ecological k
49582	0	a	yeah
49583	0	a	consumers
49584	0	a	and
49585	0	a	but about the the price of adding this solar battery , would it be something really that will increase the price of production more ,
49586	0	a	no ?
49587	0	a	So .
49588	0	a	Yeah .
49589	0	a	Yeah ,
49590	0	a	yeah .
49591	0	a	Ecologists ,
49592	0	a	yeah ,
49593	0	a	yeah ,
49594	0	a	yeah ,
49595	0	a	yeah ,
49596	0	a	yeah .
49597	0	a	Yeah .
49598	0	a	Yeah .
49599	0	a	Alrigh
49600	0	a	In fact , having them both will
49601	0	a	if we want to have battery , regular battery and and the solar energy battery it could be it will it will add a little bit of the price , but it will be an added value also
49602	0	a	that will be compensated ,
49603	0	a	so .
49604	0	a	Yeah .
49605	0	a	Okay .
49606	1	a	And what tha what about the materials ?
49607	0	a	Impersonal , .
49608	0	a	And the materials ,
49609	0	a	it depends
49610	0	a	for example you if you have a wooden material it can be more
49611	0	a	the plastic material is more common it is very resistant
49612	0	a	but , you know , something wooden will be like ,
49613	0	a	I do not know high cl so a special high class ,
49614	0	a	or you know , you can have some
49615	0	a	Yeah , even if it is not completely wood , but just a part of the , you know , will be wooden , in wood and it can be interesting .
49616	0	a	Yeah .
49617	0	a	Special for
49618	0	a	Yeah ,
49619	1	a	and i if you we want to put fashion in electronics maybe we can try to do something with wood .
49620	0	a	Yeah .
49621	0	a	okay ,
49622	0	a	seems to be interesting , .
49623	0	a	And so
49624	1	a	the last point is y also would do you want to have some very cheap integrated cir circuits , chips , or do you have low level or or very very expensive ,
49625	1	a	it depends , but I think that low level will be , you know , it is an interim module .
49626	0	a	Yeah ,
49627	0	a	we want something easy to use
49628	1	a	and so I think maybe something very low level wou would be enough .
49629	0	a	Yeah .
49630	0	a	Yeah .
49631	0	a	Yeah ,
49632	0	a	yeah .
49633	0	a	And you think that we will be
49634	0	a	Okay .
49635	0	a	Yeah , I think it will fit on the price we want , twel twelve Euros ,
49636	0	a	so .
49637	0	a	So
49638	0	a	wood .
49639	1	a	And what about the buttons ?
49640	0	a	No
49641	0	a	it is fashion , yeah .
49642	1	a	I think the buttons I pr I prefer , you know , the LCD you know lighted buttons
49643	0	a	because , you know , it is I do not know yeah ,
49644	0	a	in the dark , it is fashion and it is related to how beautiful it is or if you want to watch TV in the darkness or if you want to lo find your find your your remote control that is lost , you know in the darkness
49645	0	a	it is very easy so , right .
49646	0	a	What about the touch scr touch screen ?
49647	0	a	For example .
49648	0	a	It is it is expensive
49649	0	a	I I guess .
49650	0	a	I think a touch screen will be t as expensive as the LCD buttons so .
49651	0	a	But And it is a kind of other design , I mean .
49652	0	a	It can also be interesting to have this kind of
49653	0	a	Yeah .
49654	0	a	So
49655	0	a	you got email ?
49656	0	a	I dunno .
49657	0	a	I think we have only five minutes left .
49658	0	a	Okay .
49659	0	a	Participant four ?
49660	0	a	Functional requirements ?
49661	0	a	This one ?
49662	0	a	Okay .
49663	0	a	no , trend watching .
49664	0	a	The other one .
49665	0	a	Yeah .
49666	0	a	, I think so ,
49667	0	a	just
49668	0	a	Yeah , so
49669	1	a	just to meet the user requirements I would just do a s short anal analysis of the remote control market
49670	0	a	and to kind of have a better overview of what is the fashion in general I have checked more than only the remote control market ,
49671	0	a	so
49672	1	a	next .
49673	0	a	So
49674	0	a	again , it is pretty much similar to what I have said in the previous meeting .
49675	0	a	user really really want a fancy look and feel .
49676	0	a	They are not so so interested in functional look and feel ,
49677	0	a	okay .
49678	0	a	Like the one you have shown , David , with all the buttons and I mean i i
49679	0	a	it sounds good technically
49680	0	a	but it is it is not what they want
49681	0	a	and So ,
49682	0	a	second point is they still want it
49683	0	a	it to be technologically innovative , so maybe it is sort of related to what you have said with the speech recognition and so on .
49684	0	a	At the same time , it is important that it is easy to use .
49685	0	a	So
49686	0	a	that were the three first points from the remote control analysis .
49687	0	a	Now i if we look at fashion in general
49688	0	a	Okay .
49689	0	a	Wha what we really see this year is that everything from clothes to shoes and furniture is is inspired by fruits and vegetables ,
49690	0	a	okay ,
49691	1	a	so I think we really have to take this into account for the design of the the thing .
49692	0	a	yes .
49693	0	a	Yeah ,
49694	0	a	yeah .
49695	0	a	Okay , yeah .
49696	0	a	Cause it is it is really what people want .
49697	1	a	Even if it is in general fashion , we want it to be in the remote control .
49698	0	a	And then if if we take the ordering or the ranking of all the points , fancy look and feel has , on a score of seven would have six as importance .
49699	0	a	the remote control has to be technologically innovative , it is three .
49700	0	a	Then easy to use it is not so important actually with respect to other y other ones .
49701	0	a	Okay .
49702	0	a	So we see fancy look an look and feel is the most important one , and then if we combine this with the fashion from Milan and Paris we go to the fruits and vede vegetables .
49703	0	a	And fruit and vegetables
49704	0	a	yeah .
49705	0	a	And the other point I have not mention is people wan want to have a spongy touch ,
49706	0	a	okay
49707	0	a	so
49708	0	a	this is this maybe does not really fit with the wooden design .
49709	0	a	Spongy Kay .
49710	0	a	Okay ,
49711	0	a	yeah ,
49712	0	a	yeah .
49713	0	a	I dunno .
49714	0	a	Yeah ,
49715	0	a	but the problem is which kind of material do you need to to be spongy ?
49716	0	a	Pla S Very stuff
49717	0	a	Okay , rubber rubber desi
49718	0	a	okay ,
49719	0	a	yeah .
49720	0	a	Yeah
49721	0	a	thi this is this would be like plastic like , but rubber , mayb maybe , you know , rubber like device ,
49722	0	a	so Okay ,
49723	0	a	tha tha
49724	0	a	that was the main point , I think , from the trend in fashion .
49725	0	a	Yeah .
49726	0	a	Yeah .
49727	0	a	Okay .
49728	0	a	So
49729	1	a	we have to take decisions about the component concepts , about the energy .
49730	0	a	So ,
49731	0	a	as you say you want something technologically innovative ,
49732	0	a	maybe using solar energy and with battery would be something interesting ,
49733	0	a	maybe will attract pro ecology consumers .
49734	0	a	Yeah .
49735	0	a	Solar .
49736	0	a	Okay .
49737	0	a	Yeah .
49738	0	a	It will be a
49739	0	a	Yeah .
49740	0	a	cheap imprint
49741	0	a	so you s you propose low level chips would be enough to have something working well .
49742	0	a	Yeah ,
49743	0	a	I think
49744	0	a	Yeah ,
49745	0	a	yeah .
49746	0	a	Yeah .
49747	1	a	Case .
49748	0	a	Later ?
49749	0	a	Pla
49750	0	a	yes .
49751	0	a	So you think case .
49752	0	a	Something spongy .
49753	0	a	Someth no wood .
49754	0	a	No wood
49755	0	a	but Plastic ?
49756	0	a	Would some
49757	1	a	I think we can have wood for example in the bottom and , you know .
49758	0	a	Yeah , so when I think it is Maybe not no wood , but I mean ma maybe not the part you touching you know .
49759	0	a	Maybe you
49760	0	a	It is it is natural .
49761	0	a	Yeah , maybe the base .
49762	0	a	It depends on the design we want ,
49763	0	a	so .
49764	0	a	But still y
49765	0	a	Yeah .
49766	0	a	Yeah , it is natural
49767	0	a	and i
49768	0	a	And it can be correlated to energy , solar energy , so for the marketing aspect ,
49769	0	a	you know ,
49770	0	a	saying that it is ecol
49771	0	a	, yeah , it is not right ,
49772	0	a	so .
49773	0	a	Th
49774	0	a	The feeling is natural ,
49775	0	a	so maybe we can stay with wood .
49776	0	a	Yeah ,
49777	0	a	I mean it is not exactly right for the spongy point of view .
49778	0	a	But it is still fashion .
49779	1	a	But we could maybe have both like part of wood and some rubber for the buttons ,
49780	0	a	or
49781	0	a	I dunno .
49782	0	a	Okay .
49783	0	a	Yeah ,
49784	1	a	something that you can into it .
49785	0	a	Yeah .
49786	1	a	and what about the user interface concept ?
49787	0	a	Google and fancy ?
49788	0	a	Because I think that with the voice and gesture recognition there are still some disadvantages with this .
49789	0	a	Google and and fancy ,
49790	0	a	f
49791	0	a	how about the the voice ?
49792	0	a	And
49793	1	a	maybe we can do some marketing studies asking people if they are interested
49794	0	a	and how
49795	0	a	It It is an an interesting concept to see to have voice control .
49796	0	a	Yeah .
49797	0	a	Yeah .
49798	0	a	Yeah .
49799	0	a	The smart controller .
49800	0	a	Yeah .
49801	0	a	But and
49802	0	a	the problem is I I am we can infer i if you have v voice control why not to put it directly on the the TV , so speak directly to the TV and you do not need a remote control actually ,
49803	0	a	so .
49804	0	a	Yeah ,
49805	0	a	but you need a receiver to recognize the gestures and the voice .
49806	0	a	But it will be embedded on the TV and not on the remote control ,
49807	0	a	so .
49808	0	a	That is true .
49809	0	a	Yeah
49810	0	a	d
49811	0	a	I dunno .
49812	0	a	Okay .
49813	0	a	So maybe we will just focus on the Google controller plus the fancy controller ,
49814	1	a	maybe try to mix them these two concepts together , just in one and do a remote control with solar energy and batteries and with lev low level chips and wood .
49815	0	a	Yeah .
49816	0	a	It is good .
49817	1	a	And LCD buttons .
49818	0	a	Yeah , LCD .
49819	0	a	Yeah ,
49820	0	a	I think for these supplements the solar energy would be something quite interesting and not maybe too difficult to add .
49821	0	a	Yeah ,
49822	0	a	yeah ,
49823	0	a	yeah .
49824	0	a	And pf what can we think a supplement to
49825	1	a	I think the supplement can be the voice .
49826	1	a	What interface ?
49827	0	a	Yeah ,
49828	1	a	no not forgetting about the fruits and vegetables trends .
49829	0	a	Yeah ,
49830	1	a	for the interface something added value .
49831	0	a	It is just , you know , it is not the most important , but it can be a part of
49832	0	a	Yeah ,
49833	0	a	yeah .
49834	0	a	With a module ?
49835	0	a	You mean the remote control with a mur module if you want you can just use commands , words and use them when you do not want to use your fingers .
49836	0	a	Yeah .
49837	0	a	To push button , yeah ,
49838	0	a	yeah .
49839	1	a	Even it is for s just some kids , you know , switching channels one two three four .
49840	1	a	Turning the TV o on o or off .
49841	0	a	Yeah , turning yeah
49842	0	a	, yeah .
49843	1	a	Not very complex commands , but easy commands ,
49844	0	a	so .
49845	0	a	So ,
49846	0	a	adding some vocal commands .
49847	0	a	Yeah .
49848	0	a	Simple ones ?
49849	0	a	Okay .
49850	0	a	Yeah , simple ones
49851	0	a	for
49852	1	a	expensive buttons
49853	0	a	Yeah ,
49854	0	a	to make some new
49855	0	a	Yeah .
49856	0	a	So
49857	0	a	the next meeting will start in thirty meeti minutes
49858	0	a	so
49859	0	a	we will you will all have to work in in your direction .
49860	1	a	So you will have to work on the look and feel design , to have the easy to use , powerful and fancy remote control with some added value such as the simple vocal commands recognition .
49861	0	a	Yeah .
49862	0	a	Yep .
49863	0	a	Yeah .
49864	1	a	you will have to work more , Baba , on the spongy way to to add spongy touch to the buttons and try to find maybe a nice shape for the wooden remote control .
49865	0	a	And I sup I think we will have to evaluate th the product too .
49866	0	a	Yeah .
49867	0	a	Okay ,
49868	0	a	fruits .
49869	0	a	Yeah .
49870	1	a	If possible .
49871	0	a	Okay .
49872	0	a	And remember as as I said last meeting , we really have to build a fashion remote control and the colour of the the society will be really it will be seen in the remote control .
49873	0	a	Need it to be , okay .
49874	0	a	So you will have Baba and David Jordan you will have to work together on the prototype and you will have next time to show us modelling a cl a clay remote control ,
49875	1	a	so you will have to model model something .
49876	0	a	Yeah .
49877	0	a	Okay .
49878	0	a	Okay .
49879	0	a	Yep
49880	0	a	Okay .
49881	0	a	And I think that some specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach .
49882	0	a	Okay .
49883	0	a	So ,
49884	0	a	no more questions ,
49885	1	a	we can close the session .
49886	0	a	Yeah .
49887	0	a	 
49888	0	a	So , ready ?
49889	0	a	Sorry ,
49890	0	a	I I
49891	0	a	I am afraid
49892	0	a	thi this remote control will stay a prototype .
49893	0	a	No not really
49894	0	a	Kay
49895	0	a	Just
49896	0	a	Crap .
49897	0	a	Okay .
49898	0	a	It is perfect .
49899	0	a	Your judgement it is is biased .
49900	0	a	Kay ,
49901	0	a	so whe where is the remote control ?
49902	0	a	Yep .
49903	0	a	So ,
49904	0	a	we are
49905	0	a	So
49906	1	a	let is go for our detailed design meeting .
49907	0	a	Where ?
49908	0	a	It is here .
49909	0	a	Okay .
49910	0	a	So I will still play the role of the secretary ,
49911	0	a	and
49912	0	a	we will have first the project presentation by our User Interface Designer , David Jordan , and our Industrial Designer , Baba .
49913	0	a	Okay .
49914	0	a	Yeah .
49915	0	a	Yeah .
49916	0	a	Yeah .
49917	0	a	Kay .
49918	1	a	So we will have to evaluate the your proposed remote control , and have an idea of the price that this thing will cost .
49919	0	a	And in case
49920	1	a	if we are we all agree on the fabrica of building of this remote control , we will evaluate the production .
49921	0	a	So
49922	1	a	maybe I will let the our two designers talk about so their
49923	0	a	You have s
49924	0	a	oh , sorry .
49925	0	a	I have slides .
49926	0	a	Okay .
49927	0	a	Oops .
49928	0	a	Effectively one slide
49929	1	a	and maybe we can discuss everything .
49930	0	a	Product prod
49931	0	a	Yep .
49932	0	a	What slides ?
49933	0	a	Yeah .
49934	0	a	Okay .
49935	0	a	Okay .
49936	0	a	So , this is our product or prototype .
49937	0	a	This is made by clay .
49938	0	a	Looks strange .
49939	0	a	Yeah .
49940	0	a	the basic colour is yellow and red .
49941	0	a	Yellow is our company colour , red it is is more attractive .
49942	0	a	Okay .
49943	0	a	So we used two basic colour , yellow and red .
49944	0	a	And the shape , there is two basic shape .
49945	0	a	The first is a circle and the second is a triangle s piece .
49946	0	a	It is
49947	0	a	we call it a mushroom design .
49948	0	a	Okay .
49949	0	a	It is looks like some mushroom , so we call it mushroom design .
49950	0	a	Yeah .
49951	0	a	Yeah ,
49952	0	a	yeah
49953	0	a	I am sure .
49954	0	a	So this is a introduction of our product .
49955	0	a	Next a mo
49956	1	a	Okay ,
49957	0	a	yeah ,
49958	0	a	so next slide .
49959	0	a	Genetically modified mushroom I will say , but
49960	1	a	keep on speaking .
49961	0	a	So there are several key features of our pr prototype .
49962	0	a	The first is that it is fuzzy .
49963	0	a	I am sure this would be the unique design the market .
49964	0	a	Oh .
49965	0	a	Maybe , I hope so .
49966	0	a	Yeah , so it is a fuzzy design , and a unique design .
49967	0	a	Yeah , that is true .
49968	0	a	, and
49969	0	a	the second key feature is that s circle channel selection .
49970	0	a	In the traditional key traditional controller use button to to select the channel but now we have a s circle , so we can turn this ball to t to select channel .
49971	0	a	So it is quite convenient for user to use it .
49972	0	a	Chan
49973	0	a	Yeah , okay ,
49974	1	a	but do not touch do not destroy your prototype .
49975	0	a	Yeah , s
49976	0	a	okay .
49977	0	a	the third feature is a stable triangle base .
49978	0	a	this sta this triangle base is very stable , so
49979	0	a	so it is it is
49980	0	a	it is unlikely you cannot found it .
49981	0	a	So it is v , you can put it in the table so you can turn the the ball to cha to select the channel and there is some cute button .
49982	0	a	You c can can you can see the the shape of the buttons n is a mushroom , so
49983	0	a	Yeah , everything is mushroom .
49984	0	a	Everything is mushroom .
49985	0	a	Yeah .
49986	1	a	So we can call our remote control the mushroom .
49987	0	a	Mush
49988	0	a	Mushroom design , yeah .
49989	0	a	Yeah but it is not like really mushroom because you have you know like lemon shape , you know , centre is yellow and t d
49990	0	a	To integrate , you know
49991	0	a	yeah .
49992	0	a	Yeah
49993	0	a	Okay .
49994	0	a	Yeah ,
49995	0	a	th that is why if you put it in the table , be careful , somebody will eat it .
49996	0	a	I do not think
49997	0	a	I hope nobody will eat it
49998	1	a	You know , to integrate the fruit aspect ,
49999	0	a	you know the the in
50000	0	a	Really ?
50001	0	a	But
50002	0	a	Fruit and vegetable ,
50003	0	a	so mushroom was a kind of you know
50004	0	a	Mushroom ?
50005	0	a	Oh , I am not sure .
50006	0	a	Oh .
50007	0	a	Yeah , because mushroom was not in the trends .
50008	0	a	I mean there was fruits
50009	0	a	yeah .
50010	0	a	Fruits and vegetables .
50011	0	a	Vegetables .
50012	0	a	Yeah .
50013	0	a	Mushroom is a vegetable .
50014	0	a	I do not think it is .
50015	0	a	Yeah
50016	0	a	Yeah .
50017	0	a	It is vegetable .
50018	0	a	Yeah .
50019	0	a	So th it is something eatable .
50020	0	a	We can
50021	0	a	it is a veg a kind of vegetable ,
50022	0	a	but you know we we integrated them with different colour .
50023	0	a	Yeah .
50024	0	a	Yeah .
50025	0	a	But anyway this is not a mushroom anyway , so it is fine .
50026	0	a	Yeah .
50027	1	a	I think we take into account what you said about fruit and vegetable you know .
50028	0	a	This , you know , very enlighted colours , you know .
50029	0	a	No , I mean ,
50030	0	a	yeah
50031	0	a	yeah .
50032	0	a	Inspira inspiration is
50033	0	a	True .
50034	0	a	And inspired colour and and very sophisticated material , so .
50035	0	a	Yeah .
50036	0	a	And so
50037	0	a	So what we w
50038	1	a	what I can add is that , you know
50039	0	a	he talk about what is outside , so what is inside is what we dis what we talked before about , you know , the chip , it is a low level chip , and
50040	0	a	You know , we do not need to k .
50041	1	a	Next slide .
50042	0	a	, no this our only two slides .
50043	0	a	Yeah .
50044	0	a	So we cut it to see .
50045	0	a	You know wi
50046	0	a	the low level chips inside and
50047	0	a	you know the LCD button and the i
50048	0	a	The battery it is under .
50049	0	a	Okay .
50050	0	a	So where is the battery battery ?
50051	0	a	Base .
50052	0	a	It is in th in in the base , yeah .
50053	0	a	In the base .
50054	0	a	In the basement .
50055	0	a	Here ?
50056	0	a	In the basement .
50057	0	a	And where is the solar solar cell ?
50058	0	a	Where is the solar cell ?
50059	0	a	Oh .
50060	0	a	But we say we sa we said solar .
50061	0	a	In fact this this this this is a kind of you know revolutionary solar receptor that we can put outside and
50062	0	a	I do not think so , but it it is might be okay , so .
50063	0	a	Do you think it wo not be It wo not cris increase the price ?
50064	0	a	Okay , we will see after .
50065	0	a	We will have first to
50066	0	a	so , mister money , what is your opinion according to this remote control ?
50067	0	a	I it might be okay .
50068	0	a	So
50069	0	a	Yeah .
50070	0	a	Yeah .
50071	0	a	I mean , we going to try to measure how good it is
50072	0	a	instead of just talking about
50073	0	a	we had three keys key points to for this remote control design , and first one was fancy look and feel .
50074	0	a	Okay
50075	0	a	Yeah .
50076	1	a	So w we will try to judge this feature with a one to seven scale ,
50077	0	a	one being no , I think .
50078	0	a	just let me check .
50079	0	a	So , four point three point five , it means it is acceptable .
50080	0	a	One one being true , and seven being false .
50081	0	a	Okay .
50082	0	a	Oops .
50083	0	a	Ouch .
50084	0	a	So
50085	0	a	Do we have a fancy look and feel , according to you ?
50086	0	a	But is it
50087	0	a	I will agree it is unique ,
50088	0	a	but is it really
50089	0	a	Yeah I mean , fancy was was defined by s fruit and vegetable look .
50090	0	a	Okay .
50091	0	a	Yeah , I think so .
50092	0	a	I think you have nice colours .
50093	0	a	I do not
50094	0	a	The sha the bowl shape people like .
50095	0	a	Yeah , the shape is unique , and the colour
50096	0	a	So it depend on how d do you define fancy .
50097	0	a	Is it really fancy ?
50098	0	a	But it is
50099	0	a	you have the lemon aspect of this th this this thing .
50100	0	a	Yeah .
50101	1	a	Maybe if you change if you take the buttons out , and maybe do things like that
50102	0	a	It would be bet more like a lemon ?
50103	0	a	Yeah .
50104	0	a	Do Do not do that , please .
50105	0	a	I dunno where the lemon is , but I mean it is not obvious .
50106	0	a	I it is it is i this shape is a lemon like , so
50107	0	a	Yeah .
50108	0	a	If
50109	1	a	I dunno , maybe improving the texture of like having it less smooth or
50110	0	a	Yeah .
50111	0	a	Because i
50112	1	a	Less button .
50113	0	a	so , my mush .
50114	0	a	Looks like more fruit .
50115	0	a	Yeah , but you do not have any button now .
50116	0	a	Maybe a pineapple ?
50117	1	a	And you know , you have the finger here , with the buttons ?
50118	0	a	It looks more like a pineapple .
50119	0	a	I dunno .
50120	0	a	Yeah .
50121	0	a	That is yeah , is that
50122	0	a	that is a good idea .
50123	0	a	Yeah , it is getting
50124	0	a	Okay .
50125	0	a	So that is great .
50126	0	a	That is great .
50127	0	a	Sorry .
50128	0	a	What is the use for that ?
50129	0	a	And where is the voice recognition ?
50130	0	a	Okay .
50131	0	a	, for turn turn the ball .
50132	0	a	I have no idea , so .
50133	0	a	If you want to turn the ball , it is very it is very convenient for you to to to turn the ball to change the channel .
50134	0	a	I have no idea
50135	0	a	what
50136	0	a	If it is fancy or not .
50137	0	a	, it is embedded , your microphone .
50138	0	a	Yeah , that is
50139	0	a	Wait th that is the second point .
50140	0	a	Th this th th there is two two functions .
50141	0	a	This is microphone array
50142	0	a	Okay .
50143	0	a	First one is we have to judge the fancy look and feel .
50144	0	a	Okay .
50145	0	a	Is it better like that ?
50146	0	a	Looks okay ,
50147	1	a	let is say it is a pineapple now .
50148	0	a	I mean
50149	0	a	No , the colour is okay , that is fine .
50150	0	a	So we can we can say t
50151	0	a	The colour , is the colour acceptable ?
50152	0	a	So the shape now .
50153	0	a	I mean it is
50154	0	a	but I would say there is more too much red .
50155	0	a	It looks like a
50156	0	a	now you took it .
50157	0	a	It is too much red ?
50158	0	a	In the basement ?
50159	0	a	I will give I will I will gi
50160	0	a	I will give two or three .
50161	0	a	if
50162	0	a	Right .
50163	0	a	It looks like a pineapple with cherry on top .
50164	0	a	So , from one to seven ?
50165	0	a	No , seven is false and one is true .
50166	0	a	Seven is the ma the maximum ?
50167	0	a	Three , I will say three .
50168	0	a	Three , it is okay .
50169	0	a	Three , three .
50170	0	a	Three ?
50171	0	a	Okay .
50172	0	a	Three is fine for me .
50173	0	a	Three .
50174	0	a	Is not it bitter like that ?
50175	0	a	Feasible ?
50176	0	a	You said previously that you there is microphone inside an
50177	0	a	Oh .
50178	0	a	Kay
50179	0	a	Yeah
50180	0	a	yeah
50181	0	a	yeah .
50182	0	a	Then let me
50183	0	a	The other criterion is is it technologically technologically in innovative .
50184	0	a	What other
50185	0	a	Is it easy to use ?
50186	0	a	Embedded .
50187	0	a	Yeah , this is microphone array , in fact .
50188	0	a	It is a micro array , okay .
50189	0	a	There four microphone .
50190	0	a	Okay ,
50191	0	a	and you have the
50192	0	a	there is the technology inside that recognise simple vocal comments ?
50193	0	a	And you can turn it
50194	0	a	so maybe it is techno technologically
50195	0	a	innov innovative ?
50196	0	a	We have tactile buttons .
50197	0	a	So they they
50198	0	a	they
50199	0	a	they there is a microphone array .
50200	0	a	Yeah ,
50201	0	a	yeah .
50202	0	a	So you can capture voice
50203	0	a	yeah ,
50204	0	a	you c
50205	0	a	Yeah , so you can capture
50206	0	a	s voice from different directions .
50207	0	a	Oh yeah ,
50208	0	a	yeah .
50209	0	a	And I think you you have never seen a rou a round remote control , so it is
50210	0	a	I W
50211	0	a	Yeah ,
50212	0	a	but
50213	0	a	I see , you have microphone array embedded .
50214	0	a	Yeah bu but when you say technologically it is more I dunno , in the core , or single .
50215	0	a	Yeah .
50216	0	a	You have
50217	0	a	That is good .
50218	0	a	No , that is good .
50219	0	a	Yeah .
50220	0	a	Oh , yeah .
50221	0	a	Yeah , th that is another really good point .
50222	0	a	Maybe okay .
50223	0	a	I think technically it is acceptable , so Yeah .
50224	0	a	Maybe two ?
50225	0	a	Two ?
50226	0	a	I would say two
50227	0	a	So using the same scale , two ?
50228	0	a	Okay .
50229	0	a	Two , yeah , two .
50230	0	a	It is it is fine , so .
50231	0	a	You agree ?
50232	0	a	It is better like that ,
50233	0	a	is not it ?
50234	0	a	Okay .
50235	0	a	Yeah , I agree .
50236	0	a	Now maybe the most critical one .
50237	0	a	Most
50238	0	a	Eh , for th the vocal command yes , it is might be easy .
50239	1	a	L last one w I would like to judge is
50240	0	a	is it easy to use ?
50241	0	a	Yeah but this this turning
50242	0	a	can you can you just re explain me the
50243	0	a	Please .
50244	0	a	But it is just speaking .
50245	0	a	Yeah , it is very easy .
50246	0	a	You just need the command .
50247	0	a	You can use this in this way .
50248	0	a	As a principle .
50249	1	a	Yeah .
50250	0	a	Th this is the base .
50251	0	a	Yeah .
50252	0	a	So you can turn to change the channel .
50253	0	a	Yeah but how how intuitive is it to turn things to change channels ?
50254	0	a	Like if you want to go from
50255	0	a	Yeah but imagine you y
50256	0	a	Yeah I am I am no
50257	0	a	I am not definitely convinced it is it is the best way to if you want to jump from , I dunno , one to twenty ?
50258	0	a	How can you go directly to twenty , for example ?
50259	0	a	Yeah .
50260	0	a	You just tu turn d
50261	0	a	d
50262	0	a	Yeah .
50263	0	a	I think maybe if you he
50264	0	a	If you hear some click
50265	0	a	Oh yeah , that is difficult .
50266	0	a	Oh , ok I understand .
50267	0	a	You take take the remote , so
50268	0	a	and you can turn like that to change the channel ?
50269	0	a	I think it is quite easy to so s zapping , but maybe it will be too fast .
50270	0	a	Yeah .
50271	0	a	Yeah .
50272	0	a	That is dif that is difficult .
50273	0	a	No , no , no .
50274	0	a	I if y if
50275	0	a	it depend on the the angle you turn the I if if this is a channel one .
50276	0	a	Yeah .
50277	0	a	Yeah
50278	0	a	but y
50279	0	a	how
50280	0	a	you need to know I
50281	0	a	I think something that
50282	0	a	Yeah .
50283	0	a	I agree .
50284	0	a	I agree .
50285	0	a	But I mean if you are fro from two ?
50286	0	a	Yeah ju just imagine you have fifty fifty channels
50287	0	a	We are not talking
50288	0	a	Yeah .
50289	0	a	So it c it could be channel two , channel three , channel four , channel five .
50290	0	a	Yeah , you have a , like that , and so on .
50291	0	a	So change .
50292	0	a	Yeah .
50293	0	a	And you you can
50294	0	a	I think you can if you have a scale , so
50295	0	a	Yeah , it is a bit difficult .
50296	0	a	Oh yeah .
50297	0	a	Y fifth channel divided by the num by the by three hundred thirteen degree .
50298	0	a	So you got how many degree you you it
50299	0	a	No
50300	0	a	no , you do not have to y
50301	0	a	no it is when you when you stop t when you stop , the the turn , then the angle you stop is the angle
50302	0	a	you is the channel
50303	0	a	you
50304	0	a	It is it is very easy , because you kn
50305	0	a	you know how many channel are there in the
50306	0	a	Yeah , yeah , yeah .
50307	0	a	Yeah but y
50308	0	a	but you have to go through all the channels if you want to go
50309	0	a	Yeah .
50310	0	a	How d how do you know this angle is th is the correct one ?
50311	0	a	So you you count one degree , two degrees , no .
50312	0	a	You can do it .
50313	0	a	I do not think so .
50314	0	a	I think so I think so you can do it .
50315	0	a	I think so , you can just change .
50316	0	a	I think b but the the vocal command is easy too .
50317	0	a	You can say fifty and fifty it is okay , so
50318	0	a	, yeah ,
50319	0	a	and y that is
50320	0	a	yeah .
50321	0	a	Yeah voc vocal command is okay .
50322	0	a	But w we have said previously that maybe it is not going to be th l the main
50323	0	a	And this would be more for browsing , .
50324	0	a	There is also a number , you know .
50325	0	a	Yeah , but when you are zapping you are changing from one channel to the other , so you are passing through all the channels .
50326	0	a	So , when you say I want to go to the channel number twenty that is you have decided to go to channel twenty , so you can say channel twenty , or channel four , because you really want to go on this channel .
50327	0	a	But if you really want to to do zapping you
50328	0	a	you do not really know what you want to do , you can turn it .
50329	0	a	Yeah .
50330	0	a	Yeah .
50331	0	a	Just go through all the channels and maybe stop if there is something interesting ?
50332	0	a	Seems to be good .
50333	0	a	To see
50334	0	a	yeah
50335	0	a	Yeah .
50336	0	a	Yeah .
50337	0	a	Yeah .
50338	0	a	Yeah .
50339	0	a	Good choice , mister David Jordan .
50340	0	a	Yeah .
50341	0	a	Yeah , I mean you are famous .
50342	0	a	And but I would
50343	0	a	It is a turn off t turn off button , maybe .
50344	0	a	And also you can , if you i
50345	0	a	You ca you can turn this .
50346	0	a	You .
50347	0	a	yeah , what is what is this cherry ?
50348	0	a	Okay .
50349	0	a	Or you ca you
50350	0	a	can you can also turn this .
50351	0	a	For this you can tune it is for tune .
50352	0	a	You you if you want to skip from channel one to channel two , you you skip this .
50353	0	a	If you want to from skip from channel one to channel ten you tune this .
50354	0	a	It is like fine , from coarse to fine .
50355	0	a	This is coarse , this is fine .
50356	0	a	Yeah ,
50357	0	a	yeah
50358	0	a	yeah .
50359	0	a	That is
50360	0	a	that is very technologic , so .
50361	0	a	So it is coarse to fine design .
50362	0	a	Yeah .
50363	0	a	Yeah .
50364	0	a	Okay the th this looks better .
50365	0	a	Yeah .
50366	0	a	Yeah is is
50367	0	a	this is , from one channel to maybe to ten channel .
50368	0	a	S
50369	0	a	But I di
50370	0	a	I did not see where the t f the turn off t turn on turn off button so much activates
50371	0	a	maybe one of the it is k
50372	0	a	on off , yeah .
50373	0	a	This is from one channel to
50374	0	a	Yeah .
50375	0	a	Yeah , th you have the vocal commands .
50376	0	a	Yeah .
50377	0	a	Yeah .
50378	0	a	On off .
50379	0	a	Yeah , but it has to be on to recognise fas , that is not the ecological part , yeah .
50380	0	a	Most of the time you have the
50381	0	a	yeah it is a sleeping remote control .
50382	0	a	Yeah , sleeping .
50383	0	a	That is true .
50384	0	a	W that why we have the solar ti
50385	0	a	yeah .
50386	0	a	Solar .
50387	0	a	To compensate .
50388	0	a	Yeah .
50389	0	a	Okay .
50390	0	a	So
50391	0	a	three .
50392	0	a	So , which number ?
50393	0	a	So reasonably , is four , is one ?
50394	0	a	So , three .
50395	0	a	Easy to use , it is very relative but three
50396	0	a	it is fine , I think , it is reasonable three .
50397	0	a	Do you agree ?
50398	0	a	Three ?
50399	0	a	And what is your opinion ?
50400	0	a	It is not what you said previously .
50401	0	a	Yeah , agree , agree .
50402	0	a	Three f three for me , it is o
50403	0	a	it is okay .
50404	0	a	Four or three .
50405	1	a	Maybe you can vote to see how many everybody gives and no and just take the mean .
50406	0	a	we would not say , I mean ,
50407	0	a	those are sort of agreed but this one would be more five to me .
50408	0	a	Will you give four ?
50409	0	a	Five ?
50410	0	a	Yeah ,
50411	0	a	so maybe if Yeah but y you know
50412	0	a	You just push two button , zero and and one .
50413	0	a	w w what do y what
50414	0	a	you compare with traditional tr traditional controller ?
50415	0	a	I think it is easier than traditional controller .
50416	0	a	Yeah .
50417	0	a	If you use traditional controller you have to put a button , but now you do not have to put button
50418	0	a	, you have you just turn the turn the ball .
50419	0	a	There is two kind of balls , the smaller the the the
50420	0	a	so you can c
50421	0	a	you can c
50422	0	a	you can control the scale .
50423	0	a	So you have
50424	0	a	yeah .
50425	0	a	But in the traditional controller , how do how can you control the scale ?
50426	0	a	Yeah ,
50427	0	a	yeah ,
50428	0	a	yeah ,
50429	0	a	y you
50430	0	a	you can do it ,
50431	0	a	but you can also do it in the b if you you do not wa if you do not want to browsing all the channel you can just p there is also a button here .
50432	0	a	by pushing zero after after the first one .
50433	0	a	And that is
50434	0	a	Are there some buttons ?
50435	0	a	Okay .
50436	0	a	Yeah .
50437	0	a	Yeah , this function is just for your browsing , from one channel to th the next one ,
50438	0	a	the next s
50439	0	a	sn s , the th the third one .
50440	0	a	Previously you said that turning this was the fine
50441	0	a	Fine to coarse .
50442	0	a	Yeah , if you are changing your mind .
50443	0	a	Fine to coarse .
50444	0	a	Yeah ,
50445	0	a	yeah .
50446	0	a	And from ten to ten channels here .
50447	0	a	Y one to ten , ten to twelve , ten to t twenty .
50448	0	a	Ten to twenty and this one , t one two three four five six , like this .
50449	0	a	Okay .
50450	0	a	there is different scale , so you can you can choose how much do you want to sc
50451	0	a	Okay .
50452	0	a	But this this has to stay on the table , right ?
50453	0	a	This has to stay on the table .
50454	0	a	I
50455	0	a	i
50456	0	a	this is just a base .
50457	0	a	In fact on a flat place
50458	0	a	You can
50459	0	a	Oh yes , that is right .
50460	0	a	You can just
50461	0	a	Yeah .
50462	0	a	Yeah but then when you turn turn it
50463	0	a	Just It is
50464	0	a	Yeah .
50465	0	a	Oh
50466	0	a	Yeah , no no , no .
50467	0	a	You ca not put it out .
50468	0	a	It is just your turning from the base .
50469	0	a	You need to have everything in hand .
50470	0	a	If you want to turn , you ca not use it and turn .
50471	0	a	It is impossible .
50472	0	a	You need to put it on and turn .
50473	0	a	You know tha that is the weak point , because with a traditional one you just have one hand .
50474	0	a	Oh
50475	0	a	my God .
50476	0	a	You use your y
50477	0	a	So th this is a d next generation controller .
50478	0	a	Yeah , but nobody would be able to take it in the pocket and bring it in the kitchen and say I have lost the remote control .
50479	0	a	Nobody would take it .
50480	0	a	Sure .
50481	0	a	Yeah , you would never you would never lose this one , yeah .
50482	0	a	So nobody w will lost lose it .
50483	0	a	yeah
50484	0	a	maybe , maybe may it is the next prototype , maybe we cou
50485	0	a	Four .
50486	0	a	Yeah .
50487	0	a	Yeah .
50488	0	a	Okay okay
50489	0	a	, okay .
50490	0	a	S maybe we can change from th
50491	0	a	Four ?
50492	0	a	Easy to use , four .
50493	0	a	Maybe four , it is okay .
50494	0	a	Four .
50495	0	a	Okay .
50496	1	a	I will put four .
50497	1	a	Gonna say four .
50498	0	a	Four .
50499	0	a	Yeah , four it is more reasonable .
50500	0	a	it is even easier to maybe .
50501	0	a	You can you can erase with this er
50502	0	a	yeah .
50503	0	a	Ok
50504	0	a	Okay .
50505	0	a	Yeah , four it is more reasonable , so .
50506	0	a	So it is nine , nine over three .
50507	0	a	So , average ?
50508	0	a	Three ?
50509	0	a	Okay , so
50510	0	a	Yeah , especially on the easy to use target .
50511	0	a	Three ?
50512	0	a	Trois .
50513	0	a	Trois .
50514	0	a	Three .
50515	0	a	Oh yeah , it is .
50516	1	a	It need maybe some wo further work , but it is
50517	0	a	Yeah , s yeah .
50518	0	a	Yeah .
50519	0	a	Might it might be fine .
50520	0	a	So , th the project is accepted ?
50521	1	a	But I d m
50522	1	a	I think that it will be good to do some more work to transform this into a pineapple .
50523	0	a	Okay .
50524	0	a	Yeah .
50525	0	a	Yeah , b I think
50526	0	a	Yeah ,
50527	0	a	yeah .
50528	0	a	Yeah .
50529	0	a	Yeah .
50530	1	a	If you re we really want to have a fruitful remote control .
50531	0	a	Okay .
50532	0	a	So .
50533	1	a	That is the finance .
50534	0	a	Okay
50535	0	a	and we we had a project prototype presentation with the evaluation .
50536	1	a	So as we all agree to accept , under certain conditions , the prototype , we will have look to the final sh financial view .
50537	0	a	Yeah .
50538	0	a	Okay .
50539	0	a	So
50540	1	a	we need to calculate the production cost .
50541	1	a	As I said in the first meeting we need to have so a remote control that would cost not more than twelve and point fifty Euros .
50542	1	a	And if not if it is not the case
50543	1	a	y you would have to redesign it .
50544	0	a	Oh yeah .
50545	0	a	Yeah .
50546	1	a	So , just have a look at the okay here is the Excel sheet , so
50547	0	a	so it has the energy source .
50548	0	a	We have hand dynamo .
50549	0	a	No , we do not use that .
50550	0	a	No .
50551	0	a	We have battery , right ?
50552	0	a	Kinetic , we do not have it , I suppose ,
50553	0	a	but we have solar cells .
50554	0	a	Yeah , we have battery .
50555	0	a	No , solar cells , yeah .
50556	0	a	, how many do y do you need , solar cells ?
50557	0	a	Do you think one would be enough , or such as
50558	1	a	as number of branches ?
50559	0	a	Three ?
50560	0	a	So ,
50561	1	a	electronic .
50562	1	a	I think in each ball you have three
50563	0	a	three
50564	0	a	yeah ,
50565	0	a	three ,
50566	0	a	yeah .
50567	0	a	Three three solar cells .
50568	0	a	Single simple chip on print ?
50569	0	a	Just one would be necessary ?
50570	0	a	One ?
50571	0	a	Zero for the others .
50572	0	a	S s simple , simple ,
50573	0	a	yeah .
50574	0	a	Yeah .
50575	0	a	And sample sensor , sample speaker .
50576	0	a	One ?
50577	0	a	As we have voice recognition , I think .
50578	0	a	One maybe , yeah .
50579	0	a	Yeah
50580	0	a	yeah
50581	0	a	yeah .
50582	1	a	So the case .
50583	0	a	Is it Is sh it
50584	0	a	Wooden .
50585	0	a	So we are all already nineteen .
50586	0	a	Okay ,
50587	1	a	just keep on going , just to have an idea .
50588	0	a	The solar cell is too expensive .
50589	0	a	Yeah .
50590	0	a	Is Yes a wooden pl
50591	0	a	I and that is There is no wood ,
50592	0	a	so plastic just only , I think .
50593	0	a	Well
50594	1	a	yeah ,
50595	1	a	but what what about case ?
50596	0	a	Uncurved , flat , single curved , double curved .
50597	0	a	I think it is more like double curved .
50598	0	a	That is going to be double curved , yeah .
50599	0	a	Double curve , yeah , double curve .
50600	0	a	One ? wood ?
50601	1	a	do we need special colour ?
50602	0	a	Y maybe , two ?
50603	0	a	We have two special colours .
50604	0	a	One , you have .
50605	0	a	But it is yeah ,
50606	1	a	a a rubber
50607	0	a	Yeah ,
50608	0	a	yeah .
50609	1	a	Rather four buttons .
50610	0	a	Oh no , interface .
50611	0	a	Yeah , yeah
50612	0	a	that is special colours , sure .
50613	0	a	Y y
50614	0	a	yeah ,
50615	0	a	yeah .
50616	0	a	Push button .
50617	0	a	Yeah , we have four .
50618	0	a	Five ?
50619	0	a	I think that this will be like a scroll wheel , actually .
50620	0	a	Five .
50621	0	a	Okay .
50622	0	a	Scroll wheel .
50623	0	a	No .
50624	0	a	We don no .
50625	0	a	It it is more like integrated scor .
50626	0	a	No no .
50627	0	a	Yeah tha that is wheel .
50628	0	a	Y you tu
50629	0	a	you turn you turn it , so
50630	0	a	Yeah , true .
50631	0	a	No no
50632	0	a	no
50633	0	a	, it
50634	0	a	Okay .
50635	0	a	Yeah , maybe two scroll wheel , as we have the coarse coarse to fine scroll wheel .
50636	0	a	Yeah .
50637	0	a	Yeah ,
50638	0	a	yeah .
50639	0	a	Yeah .
50640	0	a	Okay ,
50641	0	a	yeah ,
50642	0	a	yeah .
50643	0	a	Scr
50644	1	a	LC display , maybe .
50645	0	a	So , no button supplements ?
50646	0	a	Okay .
50647	0	a	I think the price is okay .
50648	0	a	No .
50649	0	a	no .
50650	0	a	Okay we I think we have problem .
50651	1	a	Interface .
50652	0	a	I think we s if we keep on adding things
50653	1	a	so we have to Maybe
50654	1	a	if w t if suppose if we change and we g put just one ?
50655	0	a	Has it changed .
50656	0	a	It is okay .
50657	0	a	fine .
50658	0	a	Yeah w one of the m key point is solar cells .
50659	0	a	Yeah .
50660	0	a	Yeah , it was stage one , so .
50661	0	a	No y
50662	0	a	i it did change , but
50663	1	a	just imagine we have
50664	0	a	Yeah .
50665	0	a	Okay .
50666	1	a	We have change the electronics to from from the the the sample sensor to regular chip .
50667	0	a	So
50668	1	a	I think you can transform the wood into plastic , maybe .
50669	1	a	Oh .
50670	1	a	We have to delete the the sample sensor , I think .
50671	0	a	Yeah , but we have you the the voice recognition ,
50672	0	a	no ?
50673	0	a	Okay .
50674	0	a	Yeah but this one one of the feature we were not really
50675	0	a	Yeah .
50676	0	a	Yeah it is the one it is
50677	1	a	m maybe we ha we have two versions , the first version , the basic version .
50678	1	a	Advanced version we have speak .
50679	0	a	Because it seems that this can be
50680	0	a	yeah , wood into plastic and it it should be fine .
50681	0	a	Yeah , if Yeah .
50682	0	a	Or it would be better .
50683	0	a	Plastic is free .
50684	0	a	So , do we need special colour ?
50685	0	a	Because we have red .
50686	0	a	Yeah , that is one of the requirement .
50687	0	a	Yeah , red and yellow .
50688	0	a	Wait .
50689	0	a	Red and yellow .
50690	1	a	We could turn we could turn everything in either yellow or black .
50691	0	a	Fancy .
50692	0	a	We
50693	0	a	we
50694	0	a	can we can we c
50695	1	a	yellow .
50696	0	a	Black then is a regular colour , so .
50697	1	a	I think so we need if we try to have a kind of pineapple bee .
50698	0	a	Yeah , one .
50699	0	a	Yeah .
50700	1	a	So push button
50701	1	a	then it is it is the next expensive one .
50702	0	a	Yeah .
50703	0	a	An
50704	0	a	but we have integrated scroll wheel with push dut button .
50705	0	a	And I think this is one .
50706	0	a	Yeah , thi this might be .
50707	0	a	Integrated scroll wheel push button
50708	1	a	So we will we have only one ?
50709	0	a	And push button .
50710	0	a	Close to .
50711	0	a	So if we have all integrated i in the scroll wheel and push button , it is
50712	1	a	Something flat .
50713	0	a	One .
50714	0	a	I can remove
50715	1	a	maybe f you have five with push buttons , so we can just , I dunno , try to modify some of them to have
50716	1	a	yeah .
50717	0	a	Okay , so what is the bottleneck ?
50718	0	a	Double curved .
50719	1	a	How about we change the sale ?
50720	0	a	we have one
50721	0	a	Okay .
50722	1	a	Double curve .
50723	1	a	We can transform the double curve into single c
50724	1	a	yeah .
50725	0	a	F some
50726	1	a	Single curve .
50727	0	a	Yeah , but flat
50728	0	a	Case , what is the ca
50729	0	a	And then one Euro left .
50730	0	a	S uncurved .
50731	0	a	Yeah , maybe not .
50732	0	a	Yeah .
50733	0	a	Single curve should be fine , so .
50734	0	a	Oh , what
50735	0	a	It is it is a bad idea , so .
50736	0	a	Nearly .
50737	1	a	Maybe do not bat no battery , only solar cells .
50738	0	a	So we have one button , one wheel .
50739	0	a	I think there is a problem with the push push button .
50740	1	a	We only need maybe just one .
50741	1	a	Two ?
50742	0	a	One .
50743	1	a	Just one .
50744	0	a	Yeah .
50745	0	a	That is fine .
50746	0	a	Okay .
50747	0	a	That is fine .
50748	0	a	Agree .
50749	0	a	So yeah , you will have So one button , and s scroll wheel with push button on it .
50750	0	a	One s one scroll wheel , so And the vocal chord , it is fine .
50751	0	a	It I th it is fine .
50752	0	a	So
50753	0	a	So , yeah .
50754	0	a	It is good they are not charging anything for that .
50755	0	a	It think we we have done good job , as the cost is
50756	0	a	twelve fifty e
50757	0	a	Yeah , but it is under or equal .
50758	0	a	Cou could we have look
50759	1	a	Could we have look at the p the the prod the p the cost ?
50760	0	a	Okay .
50761	0	a	Yeah y actually it is wrong .
50762	0	a	We are not under twelve Euros and a half .
50763	0	a	It is not written .
50764	0	a	It is fine .
50765	0	a	Sometimes it is under or equal .
50766	0	a	It is under or equal .
50767	0	a	Okay .
50768	0	a	It is fine , so It is fine ,
50769	0	a	twelve fifty
50770	0	a	The solar cells , r is i is it ?
50771	0	a	Yeah , to be able to si to sell it .
50772	0	a	Okay .
50773	1	a	So let is say
50774	0	a	Wha what
50775	0	a	yeah .
50776	1	a	Twelve fifty .
50777	0	a	Which part is the most expensive part ?
50778	0	a	Yeah , I think it is not t t
50779	1	a	Cheaper .
50780	0	a	Solar cells .
50781	0	a	Yeah , I think .
50782	0	a	I think , yeah .
50783	1	a	But it would i be interesting for our marketing team , to make a lot of advertisement concerning these solar cells to be
50784	0	a	Yeah but it will be technologically innova innovative , so .
50785	0	a	Yeah .
50786	0	a	That is nice argument , but if it is it is still four our of twelve .
50787	0	a	Yeah , with mi
50788	0	a	It is it is really really really very very expensive , though .
50789	0	a	Yeah .
50790	0	a	Maybe if okay .
50791	0	a	Okay .
50792	0	a	Yeah ,
50793	0	a	yeah .
50794	0	a	Yeah but we just have one button .
50795	0	a	So it is easy to use and powerful , as the remote control a has only one button .
50796	0	a	Easy .
50797	0	a	I do not know about powerful .
50798	0	a	Yeah .
50799	0	a	It is easy to use .
50800	0	a	Easy , powerful .
50801	0	a	It is very easy to use .
50802	1	a	So I do not think we need to redesign the p the product .
50803	0	a	No .
50804	0	a	that is what we have just done .
50805	0	a	We have done it with it is under the if it was low , high or so .
50806	0	a	Yeah .
50807	0	a	Yeah .
50808	0	a	okay .
50809	0	a	So Now
50810	0	a	So
50811	0	a	So did you enjoy your clay modelling ?
50812	0	a	Yeah ?
50813	0	a	Was it a nice way to create your remote control ?
50814	0	a	And for the marketing guy ?
50815	1	a	And new ideas about new products , maybe , wi which would be fashion and and yellow .
50816	0	a	So
50817	1	a	So what are we going to do with this project evaluation ?
50818	0	a	Okay , okay , it is fine .
50819	1	a	Well I think we have just have to discuss if
50820	0	a	I dunno .
50821	0	a	Yes .
50822	0	a	Of course .
50823	0	a	This is my job .
50824	0	a	Yeah , it is it is good , to to create a control instead of a computer .
50825	0	a	Yeah , I think I find it really funny and amazing and interesting to go through all the process to from the beginning to the end .
50826	0	a	And designing , looking at the chips , the solar cells and and it was very informative for .
50827	0	a	Yeah .
50828	1	a	tha that was good
50829	1	a	but we should have more brainstorming like meetings , maybe .
50830	0	a	Yep .
50831	0	a	Cause we just presenting one is presenting his stuff next one his stuff
50832	0	a	and then we try to combine afterwards ,
50833	0	a	so it .
50834	0	a	Okay .
50835	0	a	Okay , okay .
50836	0	a	Yellow .
50837	1	a	I think you can think about a yellow TV now after a fruit TV or I dunno .
50838	0	a	It can be an interesting
50839	0	a	I do not know
50840	0	a	Yeah ,
50841	0	a	just a lemon TV it would be yellow lemon .
50842	1	a	Yes , just lemon .
50843	0	a	Yeah ,
50844	0	a	but y you know the traditional TV it is
50845	0	a	Yeah yeah it is flat , yeah the shape is very boring .
50846	0	a	It is flat ,
50847	0	a	Yeah , that is right .
50848	0	a	Squared ?
50849	0	a	, the lemon TV with the pineapple remote control .
50850	1	a	Could we come up with new TV with such as this kind of TV ?
50851	1	a	So you can you have base , triangle base
50852	1	a	so you the TV you can
50853	0	a	Yeah .
50854	0	a	It is really boring , yeah .
50855	0	a	Yeah .
50856	0	a	Yeah , that is that would be really interesting , actually .
50857	0	a	Yeah .
50858	0	a	Because the TV you also
50859	0	a	Yeah .
50860	0	a	Oh , that is interesting .
50861	1	a	You could f we could do a kind of fruit collection of electronics things .
50862	0	a	Device devi
50863	0	a	The fruit ?
50864	0	a	Yeah .
50865	1	a	Electronic device .
50866	1	a	Yeah , but just do not trust too much the trends .
50867	0	a	Yeah .
50868	0	a	Cause fruit and vegetables it wo not last for ten years .
50869	0	a	Maybe
50870	0	a	Yeah , maybe la next year it will be insects .
50871	0	a	Yeah , it is
50872	0	a	But I think it is good to follow the f flow
50873	0	a	and you know make it now and after , you know , if the people change their mind you change also the product .
50874	0	a	Maybe two years it is dead .
50875	0	a	Yeah .
50876	0	a	Yeah .
50877	0	a	Yeah , but this is good because it is not a long long life product .
50878	0	a	Yeah .
50879	0	a	TV is more like fifteen years , maybe , so .
50880	0	a	Yeah ,
50881	0	a	yeah .
50882	0	a	If you have a lemon lemon TV for fifteen years
50883	0	a	Yeah ,
50884	0	a	yeah .
50885	0	a	That is a yeah
50886	0	a	, yeah .
50887	1	a	We can think about TV with you know where you can change you know the aspects o like for the cell phones , you know .
50888	0	a	Customable TV .
50889	1	a	Yeah , you customise it every ti so every ti if people change , you just change the appearance , and y y you can keep
50890	1	a	Yeah , you can keep the global appearan The mood of persons , the fashions
50891	0	a	We int
50892	0	a	Yeah , TV , yeah .
50893	0	a	such yeah .
50894	0	a	You have already said mobile phones .
50895	0	a	Tha that would that would make it .
50896	0	a	Okay .
50897	0	a	Yeah .
50898	1	a	Yeah , and following
50899	0	a	Yeah .
50900	1	a	It is interesting , maybe we can create a a line of TV with a a tr
50901	0	a	So I think the costs are within the budget .
50902	0	a	Yeah .
50903	1	a	A TV for autumn and a TV for winter , you know , so it is
50904	0	a	So what i and do w is it Okay .
50905	0	a	Yeah .
50906	0	a	We are just at twelve fifty Euros .
50907	0	a	Yeah , the pr at
50908	0	a	Yeah but I think f
50909	0	a	it is really a celebrating object .
50910	0	a	Yep .
50911	0	a	Yeah .
50912	0	a	So
50913	0	a	do you think you can celebrate your creation ?
50914	0	a	Oh , thanks a lot .
50915	0	a	And you can celebrate your leadership .
50916	0	a	Thank you , mister David Jordan .
50917	0	a	So it is yellow and very
50918	0	a	a
50919	0	a	very ha it is very happy , so .
50920	0	a	Yeah .
50921	0	a	Yeah .
50922	0	a	It is party party remote control .
50923	0	a	it is it is a pr
50924	0	a	it is like
50925	0	a	yeah .
50926	1	a	The thing now is to to sell it .
50927	1	a	Yeah , it is your job .
50928	0	a	Yeah ,
50929	0	a	right , go and sell it .
50930	0	a	Sell it .
50931	0	a	Goo and good luck , so
50932	0	a	It should be fine .
50933	0	a	Yeah .
50934	0	a	Yeah .
50935	0	a	Okay and the twelve fifty twelve twelve
50936	0	a	Twenty five Euros ,
50937	0	a	yeah .
50938	0	a	Uh huh .
50939	0	a	Twenty five Euros .
50940	0	a	Yeah , I think it is
50941	0	a	It is cheap , yeah .
50942	0	a	Twenty five Euros .
50943	0	a	It is maybe a little bit expensive .
50944	0	a	No , I
50945	0	a	I am not so happy about the fruit shape , you know .
50946	0	a	No , it is not so expensive .
50947	0	a	Wh really ?
50948	0	a	It should be it should be fine , you know , actually .
50949	0	a	Okay .
50950	0	a	S
50951	0	a	I
50952	0	a	I think I like the the colour
50953	0	a	a the colour are very good , so actually so It is perfect , and
50954	0	a	I p is th y
50955	0	a	the the yellow ball thing that
50956	1	a	f like y we can we can put some double R
50957	0	a	Okay yeah ,
50958	0	a	yeah .
50959	0	a	Maybe what you can do a test .
50960	0	a	Yeah .
50961	0	a	Put it outside , and if bees come , it is really fruit .
50962	0	a	Okay .
50963	0	a	But do not put sugar in it , it is not working .
50964	0	a	No , the colours are it is perfect , yeah .
50965	0	a	True .
50966	0	a	yeah , another thing is the logo is missing still .
50967	0	a	Yeah , but the colour , I think the colour is more is most important , because I I do not think you have ever seen something like that before for a remote control .
50968	0	a	Still that was one of the requirements we had .
50969	0	a	It is yeah
50970	0	a	but it I do not think it is such a problem just putting the logo somewhere .
50971	1	a	Yeah , but we decided to have something yellow and red , for the costs .
50972	0	a	Yeah .
50973	1	a	So maybe we can just integrate it on th on one side , the double R .
50974	0	a	Yeah .
50975	0	a	That is actually good idea , so It is not a mushroom .
50976	0	a	So we have the logo , we have the colour , and we have the fashion in electronics , so we have the slogan too .
50977	0	a	So we have to give a
50978	1	a	So we have give him give it a cute name .
50979	0	a	Cute na
50980	0	a	You cannot say mushroom because it is not the trend .
50981	0	a	Yeah th no , it is the it is the pineapple control remote control .
50982	1	a	Mush mushroom controller .
50983	0	a	It is a pineapple now , it has changed .
50984	0	a	It is not the trend .
50985	0	a	It is a pineapple remote controls .
50986	0	a	It is a pineapple .
50987	0	a	Pa Pine apple .
50988	0	a	Pineapple .
50989	0	a	Yeah , pineapple remote remote control .
50990	1	a	Yeah , but just flying saucer , or
50991	0	a	I would say flying saucer .
50992	0	a	With cherry on top .
50993	0	a	Okay .
50994	0	a	Oh , that
50995	0	a	Oh unid unidentified remote control , so
50996	0	a	That is that is pineapple remote control .
50997	0	a	It is more appropriate , somehow .
50998	0	a	Okay .
50999	0	a	Okay .
51000	0	a	I think it is fine .
51001	0	a	Okay .
51002	0	a	Will you buy one ?
51003	0	a	Try to .
51004	0	a	Yeah .
51005	0	a	Yeah I will try I will try .
51006	0	a	Twenty five Euro .
51007	0	a	Okay
51008	0	a	One thing I like is the shape , because you know it is not like the the remote controls you can put in your pocket , on in your jacket .
51009	0	a	I can hel I will try versions so to see how easy easy to manage
51010	0	a	Yeah I always lose my
51011	0	a	Yeah ,
51012	0	a	so so
51013	0	a	i if it is a universal one I can use it with my TV , so it would be
51014	0	a	I think I would choose this one because of the colour .
51015	0	a	Okay .
51016	0	a	Yeah you told me you h you d you d you lost your control your TV
51017	1	a	so you need to buy one .
51018	0	a	Okay .
51019	0	a	Traditional one ?
51020	0	a	Yeah .
51021	0	a	So this one and this one .
51022	0	a	What do you choose ?
51023	0	a	What do you choose ?
51024	0	a	Okay .
51025	0	a	I prefer the laser remote control .
51026	0	a	No .
51027	0	a	It is it is will enlight your house , your home and your TV , so .
51028	0	a	Okay .
51029	0	a	Yeah .
51030	1	a	Oh .
51031	1	a	Maybe next if we decide to do something we would can put light inside .
51032	0	a	Yeah , yeah that would be an idea .
51033	0	a	Yeah but that is going to be expensive , you know .
51034	0	a	Yeah .
51035	0	a	We had some problems going to twelve Euros and I dunno .
51036	1	a	I think it it would be interesting to just to see if we can if people will buy this one , and maybe add some features to it after yeah .
51037	0	a	Yeah , afterwards , if if it is a new trend .
51038	0	a	Yeah .
51039	0	a	Yeah .
51040	0	a	Okay .
51041	0	a	So
51042	0	a	Champagne , mister Baba .
51043	0	a	Yeah that is that fine .
51044	0	a	So we can celebrate now .
51045	0	a	That is our new product .
51046	0	a	We should celebrate .
51047	0	a	Yes .
51048	0	a	It is it is fine .
51049	0	a	It is I like it .
51050	0	a	So buy one .
51051	0	a	Next time .
51052	0	a	Well , I will buy one here .
51053	0	a	Yeah .
51054	0	a	So
51055	1	a	Okay , I will close this .
51056	0	a	Yeah .
51057	0	a	No ?
51058	0	a	Okay .
51059	0	a	So I think we have finished the designing and the evaluation of our remote control and we have a nearly final product .
51060	0	a	Okay .
51061	0	a	Yeah .
51062	0	a	Final prototype , yeah ,
51063	0	a	yeah .
51064	0	a	Final prototype , right .
51065	0	a	Prototype , yeah .
51066	0	a	So ,

51078	0	a	almost .
51079	0	a	Ready .
51080	0	a	Alright .
51081	1	a	Okay , let is go .
51082	0	a	So , we are here today to to have our first kick off meeting about this new project we are going to tak to talk about in a few minutes .
51083	0	a	so I will be Sebastian the Project Manager .
51084	0	a	you are the
51085	0	a	Okay .
51086	0	a	I am Michael .
51087	0	a	I am the user interface designer .
51088	0	a	Hi I am Guillermo .
51089	0	a	I am the Marketing Expert .
51090	0	a	And I am Hemant , the industrial designer .
51091	0	a	Okay , very good .
51092	0	a	Thanks for being here .
51093	1	a	so let is have a look to the the agenda .
51094	1	a	So , we are going to go through this agenda
51095	0	a	and mainly first to to make to to be used to the tools available in this nice and smart meeting room we have here .
51096	1	a	then we will go to the plans for project and have general discussions about it .
51097	0	a	So , the goal of this project is to developed a new remote control .
51098	0	a	it should be original , trendy , and also user friendly .
51099	1	a	As usual we will follow the the project method that we are using in the in our company .
51100	0	a	It is in three step as you know .
51101	0	a	First the functional design .
51102	0	a	The second is a conceptual design , and then the detailed design .
51103	1	a	During each step of each design we wi you will work s separately , individually on your specific tasks and will m we will meet to to discuss and take decisions about what you have you have you did and what we will do next .
51104	1	a	So first , we have to to train ourself with all the the tools availables in the in this nice meeting room and particularly the the white board so we are going to go through the white board and take some s some notes or do some drawings .
51105	1	a	So who want to start ?
51106	0	a	Mister .
51107	1	a	well if no one else wants to , yeah .
51108	0	a	Okay so , want me to draw my favourite animal .
51109	0	a	Let is see .
51110	0	a	Well , I do not really have a favourite animal , but I think I have one in mind , so
51111	1	a	I am going to about the spider
51112	0	a	because you can actually draw it pretty well in the corner of a white board .
51113	0	a	You have one in mind ?
51114	0	a	Okay .
51115	0	a	The spider has a
51116	0	a	spider lives in a web and it has eight legs , and it can move all about the web in two dimensions .
51117	0	a	Unless it is a three dimensional web which y they have sometimes .
51118	0	a	There are some spiders that live in like that have like kind of a a big ball of a of a web .
51119	0	a	And the other thing is some spiders can actually fly like they have they let out like a stream of like the web building material
51120	0	a	but it is it acts like a parachute so they can actually kind of go and find new build a new web somewhere else .
51121	0	a	So I think they did this in in Charlotte is Web that movie
51122	0	a	that little
51123	0	a	well it is actually a book first but at the end all the the spiders kind of flew away .
51124	0	a	So , that is my animal .
51125	0	a	Th thank you .
51126	0	a	Very interesting .
51127	1	a	Guillermo you want to ?
51128	0	a	It would be very funny for us .
51129	1	a	kay
51130	0	a	I dunno why , but when I was a child
51131	0	a	I
51132	0	a	I wanted to be a a panther not a pink panther , or maybe yes .
51133	0	a	But do not you think it is very difficult to draw a panther ?
51134	0	a	So bad I do not like it .
51135	0	a	yeah yeah .
51136	0	a	Oh .
51137	0	a	Okay it is a friendly panther .
51138	0	a	Maybe it is happy cause it just ate someone .
51139	0	a	Yeah maybe .
51140	0	a	Actually , honestly I
51141	0	a	I
51142	0	a	I
51143	0	a	dunno
51144	0	a	what is what is
51145	0	a	his it is be behaviour ,
51146	0	a	I dunno if if it is the male who who hunts or it is the female ,
51147	0	a	I
51148	0	a	I
51149	0	a	I have watched that lions di did not hunt
51150	0	a	it is the the female lions who who hunt ,
51151	0	a	so but
51152	0	a	I like it because it is fast , and it is black as well , so it can he it can hide itself very easily
51153	0	a	and it is it is
51154	0	a	it looks like powerful , strong , I dunno .
51155	0	a	I I watch a a film about a black panther when I was a child
51156	0	a	and I was in that age when everything was shocking me a lot .
51157	0	a	Okay .
51158	0	a	Thank you .
51159	0	a	Okay .
51160	1	a	Hemant .
51161	1	a	sure .
51162	0	a	So you do not like pink panthers ?
51163	0	a	So is this an Indian or an African elephant ,
51164	0	a	cause you have not drawn the ears ?
51165	0	a	Okay .
51166	0	a	I like it .
51167	0	a	Oh yeah .
51168	0	a	Thanks .
51169	0	a	This lapel is coming out once in a while .
51170	0	a	It is not very strong .
51171	0	a	Okay .
51172	1	a	So , not the favourite animal , but I think I will draw elephant .
51173	1	a	I will try to draw elephant .
51174	0	a	It is a problem .
51175	0	a	Okay , thanks .
51176	0	a	Okay so , elephant goes like this , and then it has four feet .
51177	0	a	I do not know whether there is any dist there should be any distance or not , but I think this is the easiest .
51178	0	a	And then we have it is trunk .
51179	0	a	And
51180	0	a	yep something like this .
51181	0	a	An eye ,
51182	0	a	cute .
51183	0	a	Yeah , so
51184	0	a	and sometimes they have a hump .
51185	0	a	Poor elephant .
51186	0	a	It seems that elephants are pretty friendly and they they have one very important way a different way of walking .
51187	0	a	So when they walk , wherever they are going to put their first feet , the second feet will always be .
51188	0	a	When they will come to that position the second , the third feet will be there .
51189	0	a	That is the way they walk .
51190	0	a	And that is very peculiar about them .
51191	0	a	None of the other animals walk like this .
51192	0	a	And they are very useful to human beings .
51193	0	a	At least few few hundred years ago when there was no means of transportations or something , or when they had to carry huge loads from one place to another , elephants were very useful .
51194	0	a	And they are found in usually the warm countries .
51195	0	a	And they are the biggest terrestrial animal .
51196	0	a	That is what I know about them .
51197	0	a	So , that is what I wanted to tell about elephants .
51198	0	a	There are two kind of
51199	0	a	yeah , they are very different , Indian and African elephants .
51200	0	a	So Indian elephant is having one bump , I think , and the African have two .
51201	0	a	And then there is a difference in the trunk of the animals ,
51202	0	a	these elephants who are Indian and
51203	0	a	So at some
51204	0	a	for some elephants it is the trunk is having one
51205	0	a	Do we have some message there ?
51206	0	a	Wind up
51207	0	a	Okay , some other time .
51208	0	a	Yes .
51209	0	a	We have to I have to catch you ,
51210	0	a	sorry .
51211	1	a	We have to to go through the meeting .
51212	0	a	Thank you .
51213	0	a	Thank you .
51214	1	a	We can discuss that off line .
51215	0	a	Yeah
51216	1	a	we will discuss a f a fly or do we will do another meeting abo on elephants .
51217	0	a	Thanks .
51218	0	a	So
51219	0	a	so another important part of the project is about money ,
51220	0	a	and about
51221	0	a	so about finances .
51222	1	a	So we should target selling price of twenty five Euro for this remote control
51223	0	a	and we have
51224	0	a	which which would generate a profit of of fifty million Euros , okay .
51225	1	a	And we should target the inter an international market .
51226	1	a	So could I just ask one question ,
51227	0	a	is this a stand alone unit that we are going to be selling ?
51228	0	a	So it is going to be you already have a TV
51229	0	a	but you are buying an extra remote control for it or something ?
51230	0	a	Okay , alright .
51231	0	a	O this is the next topic we have to discuss exactly ,
51232	1	a	so let is go to it .
51233	1	a	So we should decide which kind of remote control we want to we want to we want to go .
51234	0	a	Should be should
51235	0	a	should it be specific remote control to some specific device ?
51236	0	a	Should it be a universal one ?
51237	0	a	And etcetera .
51238	1	a	So so I am waiting for your for your inputs very quickly
51239	0	a	because we have only three three minutes to go .
51240	0	a	Okay well ,
51241	0	a	so , it seems the the first thing that they have kind of specified is the price like based on how much profit we want to make ,
51242	0	a	which seems to a kind of a little strange if we do not know what the the product is yet ,
51243	1	a	but I guess if that is if that is the requirement that we need to to design the the product to actually fit that that price bracket so , I guess we are going to need to find out what is actually you know , what people ar are willing to pay for
51244	0	a	what kind of product they are expecting for twenty five Euro
51245	0	a	because it seems quite a lot for a remote control ,
51246	0	a	so it is
51247	0	a	Yeah .
51248	0	a	Okay .
51249	0	a	Okay I think this is more a job to our
51250	0	a	market person
51251	0	a	yeah .
51252	0	a	Marketing person .
51253	1	a	So it should be the topic of maybe of the next meeting just to to have an overview of this and in which direction we should go .
51254	1	a	So we need to close the meeting .
51255	0	a	we will have a new meeting soon
51256	0	a	and so the work
51257	0	a	every every of you ha have t d to do .
51258	0	a	So you have to work on the on the working design , you have to work on the technical functions , and you have to work on us user requirements specs ,
51259	0	a	alright ?
51260	0	a	you will receive some information by emails , i as usual .
51261	0	a	Thanks for coming today .
51262	0	a	Okay .
51263	0	a	 
51264	0	a	Okay everybody is ready ?
51265	0	a	Good morning again .
51266	0	a	So , today we are going to have a f second meeting .
51267	0	a	Oh Michael , hi .
51268	0	a	Yep .
51269	0	a	You are late .
51270	0	a	You have a good reason for that ?
51271	0	a	Very good .
51272	0	a	Yes .
51273	1	a	Okay , let is have a look to the agenda today .
51274	0	a	So , we are going to have a meeting about the functional design .
51275	1	a	so first before starting I w just going to to go quickly to through the minutes of previous meeting .
51276	0	a	So basically we we are not decided if w we should go for a universal or specific remote control , but I have new new i inputs for about that topics .
51277	1	a	I goin I am going to share with you .
51278	0	a	And basically we decided to to go to individual actions for each of you so Industrial Designer should wor was supposed to work on th on th on the working design .
51279	0	a	Yep .
51280	0	a	You showed us
51281	0	a	you ar you
51282	0	a	you prepare something for us ?
51283	0	a	The UI guy also work on that , yeah , and for the mar our Marketing Expert should deliver some specs .
51284	0	a	Yeah .
51285	0	a	Yep .
51286	0	a	Alright
51287	0	a	so
51288	0	a	so we are going to go through three of your individual presentations .
51289	1	a	But first I would like quickly to to decide of to give a name to the project .
51290	0	a	So , I just put d quickly Remo ,
51291	1	a	but if you have any o other names that we co could decide for just to to keep something fun for our project we we should we could discuss quickly .
51292	1	a	Any ideas ?
51293	0	a	Powerstick , yeah .
51294	1	a	the Powerstick .
51295	1	a	What else ?
51296	1	a	What else ?
51297	0	a	Mango ?
51298	0	a	Mango ?
51299	0	a	Mando .
51300	1	a	Maybe a Spanish name would work well .
51301	0	a	I was thinking of the
51302	1	a	Mando .
51303	0	a	Especially if we are selling into the US market becasue there is a lot of Spanish speakers there .
51304	1	a	Maybe something that sounds cool in English but sounds funny in Spanish .
51305	0	a	Mando .
51306	0	a	What is that ?
51307	0	a	What does it mean in Spanish ?
51308	0	a	Control .
51309	0	a	Mando .
51310	0	a	MA ?
51311	0	a	MA ?
51312	0	a	M DO .
51313	0	a	AN yeah DO .
51314	0	a	, okay .
51315	0	a	It does not it does not sound cool for me ,
51316	0	a	but maybe for a Spanish for I for
51317	0	a	Control .
51318	0	a	What does it mean ?
51319	0	a	Oh .
51320	0	a	Okay .
51321	0	a	Nice .
51322	0	a	Cause it also like in English
51323	0	a	it sounds like you know the man is tool you know
51324	0	a	because you know men like to have control of the remote
51325	0	a	so it might
51326	0	a	The Mando .
51327	0	a	But
51328	0	a	, yeah .
51329	0	a	Mando sounds Latino .
51330	0	a	Okay .
51331	1	a	So , let is go for Mando ?
51332	0	a	Yeah ?
51333	0	a	No objection ?
51334	0	a	Great .
51335	0	a	Yeah ,
51336	0	a	yeah .
51337	0	a	Yeah that is .
51338	0	a	And we could have some like you d
51339	1	a	you could have the fonts you know special , so you have man in like in in in one o in one font and then the O as like Although you do not want to cut cut women out of the potential buyers though ,
51340	0	a	do you ?
51341	0	a	So
51342	0	a	Yeah .
51343	0	a	So
51344	0	a	Okay , I think this is
51345	0	a	Okay .
51346	0	a	Yeah
51347	0	a	they are the most TV watcher .
51348	1	a	So we should be careful .
51349	0	a	Okay , I think this is more a question of of
51350	0	a	I
51351	0	a	I think this is more a question of of look and feel .
51352	0	a	But
51353	0	a	yeah
51354	0	a	it
51355	0	a	Yeah because if the product will be international
51356	1	a	Maybe maybe I should start .
51357	0	a	Marketing .
51358	1	a	Something that should be addressed later We should we should go to other for the other topics .
51359	0	a	Well that is the thing .
51360	0	a	We need to know who we are selling it to before we can really decide on a
51361	0	a	Yeah okay ,
51362	1	a	so let is stick f to Man Mando for the name
51363	1	a	and we will see for the for the look and feel later .
51364	1	a	So let is go for the three presentations right now .
51365	1	a	So , who want to start ?
51366	1	a	So maybe we could start with the market , yeah .
51367	0	a	Yeah .
51368	0	a	Okay .
51369	0	a	Okay so I have your slides somewhere ?
51370	0	a	Participant four .
51371	0	a	Yeah .
51372	0	a	Should be in participant four .
51373	0	a	Yeah ,
51374	0	a	yeah .
51375	0	a	This one ?
51376	0	a	S that is coming .
51377	0	a	okay .
51378	0	a	Yeah .
51379	0	a	Yep .
51380	0	a	Great .
51381	1	a	Okay
51382	1	a	so
51383	1	a	yeah
51384	1	a	I will I will give a brief outline about what I what I prepared for this meeting .
51385	0	a	For the functional requirements and especially for the for the user requirements .
51386	0	a	I prepare a marketing report
51387	1	a	and we have to find the weaknesses and and the the improvements we could do to the current remote controls .
51388	0	a	And also I di I did a study with for the incorporation of new technologies
51389	0	a	it seems that the remote controls have been have remained the same for the last five , ten years .
51390	0	a	There is no no significant difference between the the b the first new controls and
51391	0	a	Yeah .
51392	0	a	Okay .
51393	1	a	Sh next slide ?
51394	0	a	Okay .
51395	0	a	Yeah .
51396	0	a	Well more most of the people think that remote controls are ugly , thoroughly .
51397	0	a	So and they they admit that the the they should s they would spend more money in a fancier remote control ,
51398	0	a	which is which is good and it is interesting point .
51399	0	a	Also the people are worried about about the RSI disease , which is if you repeat the sa the same movement , which is not a with a not very appropriate device , you you will have problems whe when you will get old .
51400	0	a	So s people are are worried about the the shape of the of the remote control .
51401	0	a	They are also
51402	0	a	they get angry very often because they lost the remote control very often ,
51403	0	a	so I think it would be a good point to to l to to find a a solution to
51404	1	a	any beep any alarm or something incorporated to with the remote control every time
51405	1	a	it it get lost .
51406	0	a	And also I found that young people
51407	0	a	the the younger people are the more interested they are in incorporating new technologies in the in the remote control .
51408	0	a	Okay .
51409	1	a	So in my opinion the Mando this Mando should not be very small
51410	0	a	because the smaller it is , the more like the the liklier it is to get lost .
51411	0	a	Liklier or more likely ?
51412	0	a	likely .
51413	0	a	More likely .
51414	0	a	Okay .
51415	0	a	people also complain because they they they all have the same size of the buttons for buttons who w which are not very use like f memorising channels or or this kind of actions which are not very often
51416	0	a	but they they should not they should not have the same importance in the in the in the remote cont in the remote control .
51417	0	a	Also the z the design should fit the hand shape .
51418	1	a	So it may be interesting to to think in a in both prototypes , for right and left handed people .
51419	0	a	Well th the on the thing is though , most remote controls are used by more than one person .
51420	0	a	So unless you are kind of targeting single people you know you are going to maybe cut out some a lot of your market .
51421	0	a	Yeah .
51422	0	a	I dunno
51423	1	a	I th
51424	1	a	Anyway I think it could be int interesting to to release some a a small fraction of of this remote controls .
51425	1	a	Well maybe it could be a universal design .
51426	0	a	Sorry ?
51427	0	a	Yeah .
51428	0	a	A universal design , which is which is good for both the hands .
51429	0	a	Still shaped for yeah for your hand but not for a particular hand , right ?
51430	0	a	Well it can still be a , you can still extend past the hand .
51431	0	a	Yeah ?
51432	0	a	That is right , whether it is left hand or right hand ,
51433	0	a	but but do not you think that the two points are clashing , one thing you are saying design should fit the hand shape and it should not be very small ?
51434	0	a	The first and the third point , they are clashing .
51435	0	a	Yeah .
51436	0	a	Sorry ?
51437	0	a	Yeah .
51438	0	a	Yeah .
51439	0	a	Okay .
51440	0	a	Like Yeah , like
51441	0	a	No no
51442	0	a	I was thinking of so like something
51443	0	a	yeah .
51444	0	a	So fitting the hand does not mean much then .
51445	0	a	Well it means like , this remote here is kind of is very thin and long so instead of having you know you might have it kind of a bit bigger or , you know , with maybe some some finger molds or something .
51446	0	a	So it means design should be similar to the traditional ones ?
51447	0	a	Little sleek , longer ?
51448	0	a	And it should fit the hand .
51449	1	a	Something with the shape of the palm ?
51450	1	a	On the sides .
51451	1	a	Some finger grips maybe .
51452	0	a	Yeah .
51453	1	a	You could even have some buttons like you know on the sides and everything ,
51454	0	a	but
51455	0	a	Yeah .
51456	0	a	Yeah yeah .
51457	1	a	It sh it should not it should not be symmetric symmetrical .
51458	0	a	Mm hm .
51459	0	a	Not anymore .
51460	0	a	That is what
51461	0	a	yeah .
51462	1	a	And then finally
51463	0	a	Yeah .
51464	0	a	And finally , the incorporation of a LCD or a speech recognition system in the remote control could also be interesting , but I do not know if the budget would be large enough .
51465	0	a	First I am just wondering about the LCD stuff
51466	0	a	because because
51467	1	a	Yeah , so maybe it is a good time for me to to bring you to some new new informations .
51468	0	a	But most of yeah most of the young people to thirty to thirty years old were really interested in this kind of technology .
51469	0	a	We had the new requirements from the so from the head offices of the company , and so they wanted so they want to they would like to be restricted to TV .
51470	0	a	Yeah .
51471	0	a	Okay , I dunno if you had this information already .
51472	0	a	No .
51473	0	a	No ,
51474	0	a	so they want us to restrict the remote control to TV only because of time limitations .
51475	0	a	they want also
51476	0	a	Excellent .
51477	0	a	Actually this marketing report is restricted to TV remote controls .
51478	0	a	So we have also to focus more on the internet aspects because well well te teletext is outdated now and finally , it should be clear that the corporate image , that means colours and logos of the co our company should be clearly inde identified in the product .
51479	0	a	So
51480	0	a	Yeah yeah .
51481	0	a	I was still I was still working on this twenty five Euro price point
51482	0	a	because I think actually having looked at some of the remotes out there , this is quite a low price
51483	0	a	if if we are
51484	1	a	maybe I can get to this in my presentation though ,
51485	0	a	but yeah .
51486	0	a	Sure sure .
51487	1	a	So maybe we can jump to your presentations , right now .
51488	0	a	Yep .
51489	0	a	Okay .
51490	1	a	Okay so let is keep in mind about tha
51491	1	a	that that this last point about LCD and speech reco
51492	0	a	Sorry ,
51493	0	a	what is your ?
51494	1	a	Okay Michael .
51495	0	a	Yeah .
51496	0	a	I think even even if it was within budget do a speech reco rec system it might be a bit difficult
51497	0	a	because if you think if you are watching TV you are going to have a lot of this background noise from the TV which might interfere with the participant three .
51498	0	a	You might have some background noise from the TV which will make the speech recognition much harder , so .
51499	0	a	Yeah but you should be able to activate or disactivate ,
51500	0	a	so
51501	0	a	yeah
51502	0	a	yeah .
51503	0	a	Oh you press a press a button to talk , and the the TV the TV sound turns off .
51504	0	a	Yeah
51505	0	a	channel fifty .
51506	0	a	Yeah .
51507	0	a	No
51508	1	a	it could be command control kind of thing .
51509	0	a	It requir recognises particular sequence and then it gets activated .
51510	0	a	Means you say
51511	0	a	you should say like does that , remote control being on or be on kind of thing , and then remote control comes in the picture for the speech recognition .
51512	0	a	Yeah .
51513	0	a	Because this kind of thing means speech is there from the TV also .
51514	0	a	Yeah .
51515	0	a	So there should be something command controlled , you start and then you stop .
51516	0	a	Yeah .
51517	0	a	It is like VI editor , you are having two modes similarly .
51518	0	a	Otherwise it is just lying idle .
51519	0	a	Okay , so , could I describe the mouse maybe
51520	0	a	be easier to
51521	0	a	could I use the mouse , or
51522	0	a	Sorry ?
51523	0	a	yeah .
51524	0	a	Thanks .
51525	0	a	Okay .
51526	0	a	The wheel does not work .
51527	0	a	Great .
51528	0	a	Okay so while researching this this topic I first of all just thought of a couple of things that I would like to see in a remote , and just looked to see if they are actually available in any current remotes , and then also searched for which are the top rated remote controls on Epinions dot com , which is a a you know a a customer written basically review site .
51529	0	a	So there is a pretty wide range of remote controls these days and and this remote control on the right here is is one of the more extravagant ,
51530	0	a	but it is not really
51531	0	a	it is by no means you know on it is own in being so expensive .
51532	0	a	There are a lot of expensive remote controls out there .
51533	0	a	Looks like a PDA ?
51534	0	a	So
51535	0	a	yeah
51536	0	a	it doe
51537	0	a	it is
51538	0	a	well basically all the functions are controlled through through the LCD screen except for the really really kind of main functions , which have a couple of of their own buttons .
51539	0	a	and if you look at a lot of the universal remotes out on the market , I know we are working on television remote , but a lot of the universal remotes out there have have these LCD screens which kind of helps when you are using multiple devices I suppose because you can have multiple kind of functions d different functions on the screen at different times .
51540	0	a	But the thing that I find most interesting about this remote control , and it is kind of difficult to to see in the slide , but it has a scroll wheel on it , which is kind of like a mouse scroll wheel ,
51541	0	a	which I think is it is a really kind of important design aspect
51542	0	a	is it is
51543	0	a	Cause the thing is what a what we the presen this presentation we had is what we want the remote control to actually do .
51544	0	a	And obviously the the simplest thing that a remote control does is it just change the change the channel .
51545	0	a	Change the channels .
51546	0	a	Yeah .
51547	0	a	Now the
51548	0	a	I think that a scroll wheel is actually pretty a pretty handy way of of changing the channel .
51549	0	a	Cause I know when I when I use the remote to change the channel I very rarely use the numbers on the on the pad .
51550	0	a	Mmm hmm .
51551	0	a	I usually use the up and down because most channels are you know two digit numbers and you have to press you know a special button to enter a two digit number , and then two numbers ,
51552	0	a	so that is just it is annoying .
51553	0	a	Yeah yeah .
51554	0	a	So I think a scroll wheel is is quite handy .
51555	0	a	Now
51556	0	a	the the scroll wheel is is much more useful if you have an LCD screen , and this brings us to the the point you were mentioning before about the internet capability .
51557	0	a	One possibility , if we
51558	1	a	now we need to still talk about the price point
51559	0	a	because obviously a lot of this stuff ca not be done for twenty five Eu Euro , but one possibility is to download program information into the LCD screen so that instead of actually saying I want to I want to go to channel thirty seven because I know this programme is on , you know , often you do not know what ch
51560	0	a	what channel it is on , or you do not know what is on .
51561	0	a	If you have a list of of programs on your LCD screen you just scroll to that program rather than to a channel .
51562	0	a	So if you think about it is kind of like a you know in mobile phones now you do not use you do not remember people is phone number , you remember their name and you go find that name and ring it .
51563	0	a	So this would be pretty kind of a handy thing to have ,
51564	1	a	but we we really need t to discuss the price .
51565	0	a	So , I mean there are
51566	0	a	there are cheaper this is another multi kind of purpose remote control where it is it is it is very simple , there is only a few buttons , but al each of those buttons does something different in a different context .
51567	1	a	So this is something else we might want to consider , is really kind of limiting the number of buttons ,
51568	0	a	because this is the top rating universal remote control on on Epinions .
51569	1	a	It it is really maybe worth thinking about limiting the number of buttons as much as as possible
51570	0	a	because really I think people want to be able to find the button they are looking for without even looking at the remote control .
51571	0	a	And was saying before about having different size buttons for different you know frequently used tasks ,
51572	0	a	but I think also you know the location and and shape of the buttons is important , but also the number of buttons .
51573	0	a	So if you have too many buttons it it it increases the the difficulty of finding the one you want .
51574	0	a	But there is one problem then the user has to understand each of that functionality .
51575	0	a	So
51576	0	a	Yeah well we w
51577	0	a	Yeah
51578	0	a	well we will have a bit of a simpler task in that we are only doing a television remote control .
51579	0	a	Because the same button is doing too many things .
51580	1	a	I think maybe one option is to have you know a little flip open door that that you have hidden most of the time , but contains the extra buttons like , say , the number buttons for instance .
51581	0	a	I
51582	0	a	I would
51583	0	a	if I had my perfect remote control , I would probably just have no numbers at all on it because they are just in the way .
51584	0	a	They do not really do anything .
51585	0	a	Maybe you know I
51586	0	a	although I do also find flip open doors a bit of a pain because sometimes they can break off or or whatever ,
51587	1	a	but maybe a door that you can you can permanantly remove or permanantly have on would be good .
51588	1	a	but I think definitely you need to to keep the buttons down to a minimum , but not not let that kind of interfere with the functionality of of the device .
51589	0	a	Well I guess that depends on how you market it .
51590	1	a	H I think I think that the tr the transition to this to this new remote control should not be very very abrupt very hard
51591	0	a	because w if people see a remo see the see a remote control without numbers they will think it is very difficult to learn very difficult to very different build very different to the traditional
51592	0	a	If y
51593	0	a	I am sure if you can sell a a speech recognition remote control for twenty five Euros everyo
51594	0	a	everyone will s will buy it .
51595	0	a	It does sampling out of the .
51596	0	a	If you
51597	0	a	if you have the right advertisement showing how how how easy it is and how you can , you know , navigate to a program without the numbers , then people might say that looks pretty easy .
51598	1	a	Okay , can you continue , please Mi ?
51599	0	a	So , but
51600	1	a	yep .
51601	0	a	okay , so , I think one of the really kind of useful things you can do with with internet connectivity would be to have this a programme driven interface rather than the channel number .
51602	0	a	So if we can have a higher priced remote control I think that would really be worth something that would be worth implementing .
51603	0	a	there is the LCD screen ,
51604	0	a	which maybe maybe is too expensive ,
51605	0	a	but I think also at the scroll wheel
51606	0	a	, I have not mentioned it here , the scroll wheel could be used without an LCD screen , just for changing channel numbers easily .
51607	0	a	I think even that ,
51608	0	a	I mean , that would be a fairly cheap thing , compared to an LCD screen , to implement ,
51609	0	a	but I think that would be quite useful as well .
51610	0	a	And the other thing , you say we need to we need to keep it just television , but I think one maybe one option , since this is supposed to be a kind of a fashionable device , is you know there is a certain kind of cool or wow factor that you can kind of you can have with technology ,
51611	1	a	and maybe we want to make it something that is extensible to do other tasks .
51612	1	a	Say you have like a little another little kind of base unit that can also receive signals as well as the television where you can , say , change the lighting in the room .
51613	1	a	You know that would be something maybe you could sell as an extra , so that it does not have to be part of the initial development ,
51614	0	a	but , you know , later on you could you can you know you
51615	0	a	also , selling the potential of the device .
51616	0	a	Then you say potentially you can then do other cool stuff like change the lights , I dunno , close the windows , whatever , turn the heating on ,
51617	1	a	and , I think that is something we may need to have as as at least as an optional extra to to kind of make our product cool , since we say we are putting the fashion in electronics .
51618	0	a	Okay .
51619	0	a	Okay .
51620	0	a	Okay , thanks .
51621	0	a	Yep .
51622	1	a	you want to go ?
51623	0	a	This one ?
51624	0	a	Great .
51625	1	a	So yeah .
51626	0	a	So most of the things which we are discussing about is speech recognition ,
51627	0	a	that means on my own I
51628	0	a	yeah , it should be .
51629	0	a	No , not that one .
51630	0	a	you are two .
51631	0	a	Two .
51632	0	a	Alright .
51633	0	a	Okay so the working design is
51634	0	a	user i interface could be of two types , one is the usual press buttons which are there so that the user feels that he is knoing doing some he is knowing about that technology .
51635	0	a	So he is pretty comfortable if he wants to get this , and on top of that there there could be a speech recognition technology also being sitting on the on the remote .
51636	0	a	So the old kind of users who do not want to have any changes , it can it can be useful for them , and the new users , as our Marketing Expert was saying , they can use the new gizmo which is speech recognition kind of thing .
51637	0	a	Okay ,
51638	0	a	sorry to interrupt you ,
51639	0	a	but we have seen before that there is a new way of interacting that use wheel .
51640	0	a	That is right .
51641	0	a	So anyway , that did not come into my mind , so th that is a possibility .
51642	0	a	Okay .
51643	0	a	These could be other kind of interfaces .
51644	1	a	Means we can have , depending on the cost , how much we can afford , we can have different kind of interfaces .
51645	0	a	So spe buttons are something which is very everybody is familiar with .
51646	0	a	So if you go to the market and you say that buttons are there the people know what it is , and on top of that if we are having extra functionality people are willing to shell that twenty five Euros money which we are thinking .
51647	0	a	Otherwise we are just like others in the market .
51648	0	a	So anyway that is the first , user interface could be of more than one type , and
51649	0	a	yeah that means we can do the on line changes which which cannot be done now actually .
51650	0	a	So apart from the speech , we can have the scroll kind of thing with the buttons .
51651	0	a	Now for buttons , normal requirements like bit coding and all those things are required .
51652	0	a	And for voice , limited vocabulary automatic speech recognition system is required and we require a microphone also to be sitting there on the remote .
51653	0	a	Yeah .
51654	0	a	That increases the the cost also .
51655	0	a	that is right .
51656	1	a	But means we have to see how much what kind of microphones and stuff like that .
51657	0	a	Do you think that performance of such systems are enough to to target well of such technologies is enough ?
51658	0	a	Okay .
51659	0	a	yes , if it is limited vocabulary usually it is enough .
51660	0	a	Yeah we we can target , means we can target ninety five percent accuracy or somewhere ninety seven perc
51661	0	a	That is right .
51662	0	a	Well wh I imagine also that the microphone will be an ambiance a an ambience microphones because you are not going to speak into into th into the remote control .
51663	0	a	No it it could be little d
51664	0	a	yeah
51665	0	a	it could be That is right .
51666	0	a	So it could be s a few centimetres .
51667	0	a	Well one one other thing that that speech recognition could really blow out the price for is when you want to sell into other markets , though , because , I am not sure exactly where we are going to sell this , but I presume it is not going to just be English speaking countries .
51668	0	a	That is right .
51669	0	a	Yeah .
51670	0	a	So then you have to s you know
51671	0	a	, you have to train models for
51672	0	a	Yeah .
51673	0	a	it is more like , means there are different speech technologies which are existing so DTW could be kind of which is the easiest .
51674	0	a	So you have to store some templates on the on the on the chip itself , and it is just dynamic time warping where you try to find out what it is , instead of having a model which has to be trained and being a micro controller .
51675	0	a	Okay .
51676	1	a	Okay we shou we should discuss this la later after after after this this slide .
51677	0	a	Yeah , that is right .
51678	0	a	Yeah .
51679	0	a	So we can
51680	0	a	That is right .
51681	0	a	This is a this is a this is a a very important issue in discussion .
51682	0	a	Yep .
51683	0	a	Okay , next .
51684	0	a	Yep .
51685	0	a	that finished ?
51686	0	a	No ? Components ?
51687	1	a	Yes sure .
51688	0	a	No no .
51689	0	a	Components .
51690	0	a	Yeah .
51691	1	a	So , will you go to the next slide ?
51692	0	a	Yeah so this is the design which we are thinking so .
51693	0	a	We are having a power button and the switch , which is not much , and then we are having the which is to indicate whether the power is on or not .
51694	0	a	And then there are two kind of things which can be so one is the button interface which has not been shown because because of lack of time .
51695	0	a	So we could not put that .
51696	0	a	So now where the ASR decoder is sitting , similarly there are different kind of interfaces which could be there .
51697	0	a	So there is ASR decoder which could be there , and then there could be another scroll button scroll scroller , and then there could be buttons , and all of them they will just do the decoding and put it in the math put it in the proper message format .
51698	0	a	And then there is there is the chip which is sitting , the green one , and it converts it into bit codes , and that bit codes are sent by the infrared device to the receiver .
51699	0	a	Okay .
51700	0	a	So this is the easiest design the there could be .
51701	0	a	So th an ASR decoder we can have things in .
51702	0	a	To have different technologies .
51703	0	a	So this was the
51704	1	a	my personal preference was that we can have ASR sitting there on the remote control .
51705	0	a	You know I guess you could actually train the remote control as you are using it by saying you know turn volume up , and you press the press the button like s people teach sign language to kids
51706	0	a	f well , by speaking and doing
51707	0	a	Yeah .
51708	0	a	Yeah .
51709	0	a	Yeah but as soon as you try to put the microchip kind of thing or something the price will go up .
51710	0	a	So these are the slight problems .
51711	0	a	Okay .
51712	0	a	So your your opinion is that we should go for special condition technologies ?
51713	0	a	Yeah .
51714	0	a	Because
51715	0	a	yeah
51716	0	a	the reason is that if we go into the market means though I do not have much idea ,
51717	0	a	but as he the Marketing Expert presentation was So if we go with just the
51718	0	a	Actually I am not so sure
51719	0	a	because I am the
51720	0	a	you know if I was using a remote control to , say , turn the volume up because I ca not hear it very well
51721	0	a	, I do not really want to you know drown out what people are saying by talking you know when I am when I am instead of pressing up on on a remote control .
51722	0	a	I am sure .
51723	0	a	You know if there is some there is some dialogue all of a sudden that I ca not hear , I am trying to actually find out what is being said ,
51724	0	a	so maybe speech recognition gets in the way more than it helps .
51725	0	a	Okay so
51726	1	a	Okay gentlemens , we have to take some deci decisions right now .
51727	0	a	Yeah
51728	0	a	but you know the the average frequency of pushing buttons
51729	0	a	, it is about it is about eighty eighty eighty pushes per hour , or something like that .
51730	0	a	Well it depends if it is a remote control th
51731	0	a	Maybe if the remote control is something that y you do not actually have to pick up anymore , that would be a a useful feature of the speech recogntion .
51732	0	a	If you can leave it sitting on the table and you do not actually have to find it , then that could be .
51733	0	a	Alright .
51734	1	a	so if I if I kind of summarise everything we have de we we said .
51735	0	a	We are targeting TV .
51736	0	a	We need
51737	0	a	we need to have remote control which is fanc fancy , which is which is easy to to hand not too small , not too big .
51738	0	a	we have
51739	0	a	or good shape , yes .
51740	0	a	With a good shape for the
51741	0	a	Yeah .
51742	0	a	We should bring new technologies for young peoples , and as we have also requirements to to use to to push thr toward the internet .
51743	1	a	Maybe this is something we can stick to it .
51744	0	a	And also , a very interesting things
51745	0	a	I
51746	0	a	I I have seen on on on the one of the comp
51747	0	a	o our competitor is this wheel that we can use to navigate .
51748	0	a	So so my feeling is that re regarding costs budget we have an an an target price , it is not possible to go s to go to LCD and also to go to automatic speech recognition technologies .
51749	0	a	first m m why not to go to LCD .
51750	0	a	Because in fact as we are targeting TV in fact we can use TV screen as a screen to feedback to to give some feedback informations about what we could have .
51751	0	a	Well it depends though well it depends .
51752	0	a	If we we do not
51753	0	a	unless we have some input some video input to the TV or we have control over the TV then we ca not actually display that .
51754	0	a	Like if we if we produce the TVs then then yeah we can put you know menus up up there , but otherwise we need to actually have some kind of something sitting in between the video signal and the and the TV to superimpose those those menus .
51755	0	a	So that is an extra cost .
51756	0	a	Yeah that is right .
51757	0	a	Don do not you ha
51758	0	a	do not we have contacts with people on TV or or well systems that exist that we can use ?
51759	0	a	Yeah .
51760	0	a	Well this is this is another que
51761	0	a	we still have not really defined the remote .
51762	0	a	Are we still
51763	0	a	you say we are focusing on TV , but is it still a kind of like a universal remote in that it is a replacement remote control , or is this something for our own line of of televisions ?
51764	0	a	Cause that really makes a big difference .
51765	0	a	Cause even if we have contacts we ca not really produce a remote control that can bring up menus on other other companies' TVs .
51766	0	a	It is just there are too many TVs out there .
51767	0	a	Yeah .
51768	0	a	It is it is not really going to
51769	0	a	For twenty five Euro ?
51770	0	a	I think it is impossible .
51771	0	a	That is good point .
51772	0	a	What is what cou what could be the cost of
51773	0	a	well , could we fit the the targets in terms of cost if we go s to LCD on the remote control ?
51774	0	a	Yeah .
51775	0	a	It is not possible .
51776	0	a	It is impossible .
51777	0	a	But but I dunno ,
51778	0	a	I think it would be good to know if there is any leverage in that any leeway in that that twenty five Euro
51779	0	a	because for twenty five Euro I think all we can really do is provide a very basic remote control ,
51780	0	a	and that seems to be kind of against the philosophy of our company which is you know putting the fashion into electronics .
51781	0	a	So I would I would like to know if there is any chance of of increasing the of increasing the unit price .
51782	0	a	What would be Wha but what would be
51783	1	a	one question ,
51784	0	a	what would be the goal of putting an LCD in a remote control ?
51785	0	a	What what kind of information ?
51786	0	a	Yeah but mo most of the TVs nowadays show the show the
51787	0	a	the n
51788	0	a	Yeah
51789	0	a	but yeah most of the TVs have teletext nowadays .
51790	0	a	So you mean yo you mean we we should target something maybe which is which would be more expensive but re really fancy in terms to in terms to had to have really an added value ?
51791	0	a	Okay ,
51792	0	a	so regarding the automatic speech recognition , I think this is
51793	0	a	They have tele teletext .
51794	0	a	Yeah .
51795	0	a	Yeah .
51796	0	a	Yeah
51797	0	a	because
51798	0	a	yeah .
51799	0	a	Well th
51800	0	a	Cause you can have things like the programme name instead of the channel numbers , like an interactive programme guide .
51801	0	a	Well , because they have teletext on it .
51802	0	a	Th th you have a teletext sin signal that you can that you can that you can get thr through the channel .
51803	0	a	They have t most of them have teletext , but we want to get rid well one of our requirements is to to move to teletext to to the use of internet .
51804	0	a	Yeah .
51805	0	a	So to to
51806	0	a	to browse more easily the teletext .
51807	0	a	You can get a lot more information on it .
51808	0	a	For instance through through your remote control .
51809	0	a	So what would what would appear in the in the LCD ?
51810	0	a	Okay .
51811	0	a	So you could have the name of the programme , you could have the start time you know where it is up to .
51812	0	a	The ti the start time , all the p all the programmes
51813	0	a	you could have o
51814	0	a	Well I do not know if this information is available from teletext , also .
51815	0	a	You could have a l even a little image of you know the c
51816	0	a	you know the the m the main actors or something so you can quickly just kind of even without reading
51817	0	a	Well no ,
51818	0	a	but there are the electronic programme guides out there .
51819	0	a	Are
51820	1	a	But just a small thing ,
51821	0	a	what kind of market we are targeting ?
51822	0	a	Is it that we are targeting the replacement remote market , or what ?
51823	0	a	So the remote has gone bad and the person wants to buy a new remote or
51824	0	a	because the cost of LCD thing could be as high as the TV itself .
51825	0	a	They may not have pictures , but maybe they do .
51826	0	a	There is dependi it also depends on the country .
51827	0	a	Well because
51828	0	a	for the same reason that we cannot informations on the TV .
51829	0	a	We c we could not grab information information which is not there .
51830	0	a	No
51831	0	a	but I mean with the internet you have flexibility of where you get your information from .
51832	0	a	So it may be possible that there are people out there providing that .
51833	0	a	So
51834	0	a	so that mean w w we need an in an extra internet connection to use the remote control , if you want to browse , in addition to the TV , or or it should be a special TV connected to
51835	0	a	Okay .
51836	0	a	But
51837	0	a	Yeah .
51838	0	a	Well I
51839	0	a	I think if we are going to I think we would definitely need the internet connection because even with y I do not think you could even get teletext information from the TV onto the remote control , especially if we do not control the TV .
51840	0	a	I dunno .
51841	1	a	We need to find that out .
51842	1	a	We need to close the meeting .
51843	0	a	so
51844	0	a	Very quickly .
51845	0	a	That is very important .
51846	0	a	No .
51847	0	a	If it is a really small TV maybe .
51848	0	a	Yeah , well people go to buy another remote control when they broke n broke their , and they want to go t for universal one , and they take the fanciest they can have .
51849	0	a	Broke .
51850	0	a	Okay .
51851	0	a	Okay .
51852	0	a	Okay .
51853	0	a	Okay .
51854	0	a	Okay .
51855	0	a	Okay .
51856	1	a	So this is that we z that that we should target .
51857	0	a	So the com the the
51858	0	a	the committment is the following , we do not go for speech recognition technology .
51859	0	a	The LCD is still on disc is still open to discussion .
51860	1	a	It is up to you to go through this this way and to to report report me back next meeting .
51861	0	a	So
51862	0	a	Yeah , but not sure .
51863	0	a	I think that the speech recognition technology would be cheaper the than the LCD .
51864	0	a	It is it is cheaper as compared to the LCD .
51865	0	a	Maybe it is cheaper ,
51866	0	a	but we have no
51867	0	a	Okay this is
51868	0	a	this is an open question for you .
51869	0	a	Because with the LCD you need more requirements .
51870	0	a	You need a internet connection .
51871	0	a	You need m more things .
51872	0	a	But for the speech recognition you you do not need anything .
51873	0	a	Well the thing is I think I think the type of peop
51874	0	a	I think the type of people that are going to want to buy a very stylish rem r remote control with lots of new technologies are the kind of people that are going to have you know a wireless internet connection maybe , or a you know .
51875	0	a	You just say channel fifty , and that is it .
51876	1	a	But then we should move to another target b because at twenty five Dollars ,
51877	0	a	it is
51878	0	a	To move to another target ?
51879	0	a	Means th
51880	0	a	yeah twenty five Euros is
51881	0	a	yeah
51882	0	a	, that is right .
51883	1	a	Well this is what we need to find out .
51884	0	a	Can we can we increase the the price point of this remote control ?
51885	0	a	Cause otherwise we need
51886	0	a	It is kind of hard to guarantee that you are going to Ninety five percent is not good enough though .
51887	0	a	Yeah .
51888	1	a	This is up to you to tell us .
51889	0	a	But I am definitely not keen on to to
51890	0	a	no no no ,
51891	0	a	I am no
51892	0	a	I am definit definitely not keen on going to speech recognition technologies .
51893	0	a	I am not confident enough .
51894	0	a	I am not sure that that we will have a product really that work .
51895	0	a	I that work
51896	0	a	It is real
51897	0	a	yeah .
51898	0	a	How to guarantee such performances is really hard .
51899	0	a	Well this is still is is very bad .
51900	0	a	So , this is the end of this discussion .
51901	0	a	Next meeting here are the task you have to work on .
51902	0	a	so you have to work on the component concept .
51903	0	a	you have to work on user interface , and you have to go through a trend watching .
51904	0	a	Okay .
51905	0	a	So the question is still open about the LCD thing .
51906	0	a	we
51907	1	a	I hope that next meeting we will we will take some decision that direction .
51908	0	a	Thanks .
51909	0	a	 
51910	0	a	Okay ?
51911	0	a	Good afternoon .
51912	0	a	Hope you have good lunch .
51913	0	a	Afternoon .
51914	0	a	Hi .
51915	0	a	Yeah ,
51916	0	a	we had falafel .
51917	0	a	Oh .
51918	0	a	Nice .
51919	0	a	And you ?
51920	0	a	Okay .
51921	0	a	, yes , I had something similar but non vegetarian .
51922	0	a	So today is our third meeting .
51923	0	a	It will be about the conceptual design .
51924	1	a	If I come back to the minutes of the last meetings
51925	0	a	We decided not to go for speech recognition technologies because of some reasons and we are not decided about u the use of LCD screen on on the remote control because of costs .
51926	1	a	So maybe we cou wi will be able to clarify this this question to today .
51927	1	a	at the end of the meeting we should take decision on that point .
51928	0	a	So I hope that your respective pr presentations will help us .
51929	0	a	So each of you have some presentatio presentation to perform
51930	1	a	who starts ?
51931	0	a	So marketing .
51932	1	a	Okay , .
51933	0	a	So you are
51934	0	a	you saved your y your presentation somewhere ?
51935	0	a	So you are four ?
51936	0	a	Which is trend watch .
51937	0	a	Yep .

51940	1	a	Mr Marketing Experts .
51941	0	a	Yeah that is me .
51942	0	a	So
51943	0	a	Well I investigate the preference more d
51944	0	a	I investigate deeper the preference of the users .
51945	0	a	so the the current investigation th th
51946	0	a	sorry
51947	0	a	the current the
51948	0	a	n
51949	0	a	current trends ?
51950	0	a	Yeah ?
51951	0	a	Okay .
51952	0	a	Yeah .
51953	0	a	Okay .
51954	0	a	Well wha what I found
51955	1	a	can you
51956	0	a	Yeah .
51957	0	a	Next slide ?
51958	0	a	Yeah .
51959	0	a	Thank you .
51960	0	a	What I found in order of importance from less to more important is that people want an easy to use device .
51961	0	a	After they they want something new technologic technologically speaking ,
51962	0	a	but the most
51963	0	a	what they what they find more more interesting , more or more important it is a fancy look and feel instead of instead of the current the current trend which was f the functional look and feel .
51964	0	a	So now more more cool aspect , ma more a cooler aspect rather than a device with many functions and many buttons with instead of i instead of ha of a device which can do many things , a device which is pleasant to to watch , to see .
51965	0	a	Okay .
51966	0	a	also Well in in Euro in in Paris and and Milan the
51967	0	a	in Paris and in Paris and Milan the the current trend of of clothes , furniture and all this all this fashion it is it is fruit and the the the theme is fruit and vegetables .
51968	0	a	And also in the in the USA the the current the mor the most popular feeling it is it is a spongy .
51969	0	a	Spongy means eponge ?
51970	1	a	So maybe we should we should think in in this direction , so
51971	0	a	Fruit vegetables is the the new
51972	0	a	have you seen the last exposition of clothes in Milan ?
51973	0	a	Yeah , I I did not miss an
51974	0	a	I did not miss and I saw that the fruit , there are many fr pictures of fruits and vegetables in the clothes .
51975	0	a	What what do you mean by fruit and vegetables and spongy ?
51976	0	a	What you mean clothe
51977	0	a	No , I missed that one .
51978	0	a	Spongy means it it is like sp
51979	1	a	But what is your suggestion how we can have some shape like that on the remote ?
51980	0	a	Oh , they are okay
51981	0	a	so they are not like dressed as a carrot they just have like pictures of fruit on , okay .
51982	0	a	No no , not not yet , not yet .
51983	0	a	Yeah ,
51984	0	a	yeah .
51985	0	a	So we are not going to have a remote control in the shape of of a banana ,
51986	0	a	just maybe Okay and
51987	1	a	So which fruit are you thinking of ?
51988	1	a	Oh , so you want the remote control to be the shape of a fruit , or you want just some kind of like fruit logo on the
51989	0	a	So something that looks half like a fruit and half like an elephant .
51990	0	a	So te textu textures , yeah .
51991	0	a	Yeah .
51992	0	a	Vegetable textures and all this kind .
51993	0	a	Drawings of bananas .
51994	0	a	yeah ,
51995	0	a	yeah .
51996	0	a	Uh huh .
51997	0	a	Well so this is in the next slide certainly .
51998	0	a	no no , it is not .
51999	0	a	It is not ?
52000	1	a	So maybe you maybe you can display a banana on the LCD .
52001	0	a	It is
52002	0	a	And .
52003	0	a	I ha I have not thought of any particular fruit ,
52004	1	a	but the general aspect of the of the remote control may may could remind some kind of vegetable ,
52005	0	a	some kind of
52006	1	a	instead of vegetable , some natur natural object or something .
52007	0	a	But yeah it it depends on the
52008	0	a	Yeah maybe the shape the shape
52009	0	a	No , not n not not too much focus , not too much focu not n not too s not too similar to a fruit because next year the ten the trend the trend will be different .
52010	1	a	Means buttons are in the shape of fruits , buttons are in the frape shape of fruits or something , apple , banana , something like that .
52011	0	a	Apple for channel one .
52012	1	a	So we should not be at re really attached to to the trend
52013	0	a	but
52014	0	a	For instance , yeah .
52015	0	a	African or as an elephant ?
52016	1	a	Well ma maybe we we should further specify what target are we focusing .
52017	0	a	That we can discuss afterwards .
52018	0	a	But okay ,
52019	0	a	I am not , I am not really sure if that would really appeal to everyone though , maybe just to fashion gurus ,
52020	1	a	like maybe just like a little bit n a little fruit picture somewhere in the corner ,
52021	0	a	but I do not know about
52022	0	a	I dunno how ergonomic a , an orange is .
52023	0	a	Okay .
52024	1	a	I think in my opinion we should focus on on young people
52025	0	a	because they are more open to new devi new devices and also
52026	0	a	yeah
52027	0	a	according to the marketing report ninety p ninety five percent of young people was was was able to to buy a a n a cooler remote control .
52028	0	a	To fruit ?
52029	0	a	But is it is fruit cool ?
52030	0	a	Is fruit cool ?
52031	0	a	Well I guess , you know , Apple has the iPod so ,
52032	0	a	imagi
52033	0	a	just cause they have an apple on their on their product , does not mean fruit is cool .
52034	0	a	What ?
52035	0	a	What ?
52036	0	a	Yeah ?
52037	0	a	Is the new trend
52038	0	a	of the
52039	1	a	No I think we we should think about a a shape with it
52040	0	a	a device with a shape of some
52041	0	a	Yeah .
52042	0	a	That is a question .
52043	0	a	Okay , but it has to be easy to to use though and to hold you know , you do not want to pear or a watermelon .
52044	0	a	Don do not you think we can find the shape of a fruit which is handy to use ?
52045	0	a	Or m
52046	0	a	Maybe .
52047	0	a	Well , probably the only thing is a banana that I can think of , a cucumber .
52048	0	a	Banana .
52049	0	a	I dunno .
52050	0	a	Maybe too long .
52051	0	a	Maybe .
52052	0	a	Too green .
52053	0	a	So , but I mean you also have to you have to also have , fit r all the buttons
52054	0	a	and you know .
52055	1	a	A banana .
52056	0	a	Yeah .
52057	0	a	It is , it
52058	0	a	The thing is you have t normally with with buttons , they have to be at some point attached to a circuit board
52059	0	a	so if you are going to have things like on a cylindrical kind of device it may be difficult to kind of to build .
52060	0	a	I do not th
52061	0	a	it will be rolling a lot .
52062	0	a	Yeah
52063	0	a	but I li
52064	0	a	I like your idea that we should not have a lot of buttons b buttons so
52065	0	a	do you want a an LCD with twenty five Euros ?
52066	0	a	I think
52067	0	a	Well , according to the to the report people are more interested in in a fa fancy look and feel and in a technological inno in innovation ,
52068	0	a	so , I will give more importance to the look and feel than rather than the new inputs and also it is I am not convinced about this LCD
52069	0	a	because you need internet connection , you need more things , it is not just buying a new control
52070	0	a	re remote , you need buying control remote , buying more things .
52071	0	a	Okay .
52072	0	a	Yeah
52073	0	a	and you you you will not have pla enough a lot of place to put a LCD on a banana also .
52074	0	a	Yeah .
52075	0	a	Well , you are the Marketing Expert
52076	0	a	you should tell us if it is too much or not .
52077	0	a	Well , this is
52078	0	a	Okay .
52079	0	a	So So you you you suggest to go f
52080	0	a	Okay .
52081	0	a	S
52082	0	a	so you are simply
52083	0	a	you are simply looking s to a remote control that looks like a banana with few buttons with only a few buttons .
52084	0	a	It is not so simple .
52085	0	a	For instance , yeah .
52086	0	a	Yeah for for for given an an example
52087	0	a	yeah .
52088	0	a	Okay good .
52089	1	a	So maybe you can go ahead ?
52090	0	a	Okay .
52091	0	a	Yeah no , it is what I already said .
52092	0	a	Thanks .
52093	1	a	Okay , I will give the floor .
52094	1	a	So you are User Interface guy .
52095	0	a	So you are three ?
52096	0	a	And it is this one .
52097	0	a	Yeah .
52098	0	a	Yep .
52099	1	a	Go for it .
52100	0	a	Yep .
52101	0	a	Okay .
52102	0	a	So .
52103	0	a	S next slide .
52104	0	a	Okay .
52105	0	a	So I received an email around lunchtime letting me know that the brilliant minds at our technology division had developed an integrated programmable sample sensor sample speaker unit , which is a way for you to have a conversation with your coffee machine and or remote control .
52106	0	a	But it is just a speaker right ?
52107	0	a	It is not a microphone .
52108	0	a	It is
52109	0	a	no , what it is , it is it is very
52110	0	a	It has a has a microphone , has a speaker , it is got a little chip
52111	0	a	and it allows you t
52112	0	a	Well , it is a sample sensor sample speaker .
52113	0	a	Actually I am not reading microphone there ,
52114	0	a	so that is why you can all have conversation , it just to speak to you .
52115	0	a	Sample sensor sample speaker .
52116	0	a	It means that it can recognize , it can do like a match on a on a certain phrase that you speak and then can play back a phrase in response to that .
52117	0	a	But there is no kind of understanding of the phrase .
52118	0	a	Okay .
52119	0	a	So , I mean , you know ,
52120	1	a	I guess you could build that in , you could you could link the the recognition of a certain phrase to some function on on the remote control .
52121	0	a	But basically the thing is , we have this technology available in house .
52122	0	a	In house .
52123	0	a	So ,
52124	0	a	but the thing is obviously there is still going to be a cost if you decided to integrate that because you still have to pay for the c production of the components ,
52125	0	a	so it
52126	0	a	it
52127	1	a	but it basically means we c
52128	1	a	we can kind of consider this from you know a theoretical or usability kind of viewpoint without worrying too much about you know how to develop it because we have this already done .
52129	0	a	Whilst you know , some people might get annoyed if we if we just dump it ,
52130	0	a	It is it it is no , well ,
52131	0	a	it is it will recognize
52132	0	a	I guess keywords , but you know keywords in a certain order like a phrase .
52133	0	a	I
52134	0	a	there is something that I unclear really understanding .
52135	0	a	Is this a technology that recognize keywords speech keywords ?
52136	0	a	And it is just to , it is just to playback something ?
52137	0	a	Yeah yeah .
52138	0	a	You train it for a certain , for a certain phrase ,
52139	0	a	you say
52140	0	a	the the example they said that they have up and running with their prototype is well they have actually integrated into the into the the coffee machine that that we are producing is , you can say good morning to the coffee machine and it can recognize that phrase and it will playback good morning , how would you like your coffee ?
52141	0	a	Yeah .
52142	0	a	So actually that was a bad example ,
52143	0	a	cause it does not actually ask how do you want your coffee because it ca not really understand the response , so .
52144	0	a	So this is not s really to do to to do control .
52145	0	a	Only , like , only in the sense that it it can recognize a set a set target kind of word an
52146	0	a	It is designed it is designed as a fun kind of thing ,
52147	0	a	but I guess you could use it as as a way to implement
52148	0	a	Completely pointless yeah .
52149	0	a	Yeah .
52150	0	a	This is just more like a poi pois
52151	0	a	yeah .
52152	0	a	Yeah yeah .
52153	0	a	So it it is c it it
52154	0	a	it is a easy a fancy thing that you you can bring to we can bring to the remote control that will not have any
52155	0	a	yeah
52156	0	a	comp completely pointless for the inter for from the interaction point of v point of view .
52157	0	a	Yeah but you can u
52158	0	a	Yeah but the can we use it for saying okay , channel fifty , channel twenty ?
52159	0	a	M Mando .
52160	0	a	Yeah .
52161	0	a	Yeah , unless you know , you like having conversation with your remote control .
52162	0	a	Okay .
52163	0	a	Well yeah , that is the thing ,
52164	0	a	if
52165	0	a	you can but you have to pro though I think it is a fairly simple design
52166	0	a	so you would have to record into the device every possible combination , you have to s
52167	0	a	tr train it to l to learn channel fifteen
52168	0	a	, that whole thing , not just the word channel and the word fifteen , it does not have that kind of logic in it .
52169	0	a	Yeah yeah .
52170	0	a	So this is so this is this is much more than tak taking this technology , bringing it to the remote control and using it .
52171	0	a	So
52172	0	a	Yeah , that would be some development work .
52173	0	a	So this is out of discussion .
52174	0	a	Yeah .
52175	0	a	So if if if it is something that you can we can bring easily and to put it into the banana remote control
52176	0	a	No this is banana bando ,
52177	0	a	yeah .
52178	1	a	Banana mando .
52179	0	a	Banana mando
52180	0	a	yeah .
52181	0	a	Banana man
52182	0	a	I
52183	0	a	I
52184	0	a	I
52185	0	a	I do not think it is worth it though
52186	0	a	, I think it does not really add much to the functional design
52187	0	a	and it is it is it is not mature enough to use as a speech recognition engine ,
52188	0	a	so
52189	0	a	, yeah .
52190	0	a	then it could be cool
52191	0	a	yeah .
52192	0	a	Yeah okay ,
52193	1	a	let is go ahead .
52194	0	a	Okay .
52195	0	a	Okay .
52196	1	a	So if we can just move on to the next slide ,
52197	0	a	I have just done a quick mock up of some of the features of our potential funky looking remote control
52198	0	a	Well , you see , I was
52199	0	a	I was unaware at this point of th of the fruit focus ,
52200	0	a	, so at the moment it is more of a box focus .
52201	0	a	It does not look like a banana at all .
52202	0	a	Yeah .
52203	0	a	But you you can fit i
52204	0	a	you are saying now you can fit it to
52205	0	a	Yeah .
52206	0	a	Looks like a tr look likes a a tro a tropical fruit .
52207	0	a	Yeah .
52208	0	a	Yeah , well , this is actu this could be a genetically engineered fruit that is designed to be you know square so that it packs tighter in the boxes .
52209	1	a	But , I have just indicated here , we could have actually two scroll wheels ,
52210	0	a	cause I think the scroll wheel is a fairly key part of , you know ,
52211	0	a	I think everyone has has agreed that it is that it could be quite a useful thing , so .
52212	0	a	Stable thing , that is right .
52213	0	a	To have ,
52214	0	a	But I think it is important , you know , to have two scroll wheels because , you know , you want one for for the channel , but you also want one for for the volume , because it is it is the volume
52215	0	a	i it is , you know it is very handy for it to have instant kind of feedback and response , so .
52216	0	a	But ,
52217	0	a	I have also included this turbo button
52218	0	a	because I think , you know , every design should have a turbo button ,
52219	0	a	and well
52220	0	a	so this is you know , a unique problem with with televisions is that if you have this scro this scroll wheel for the television , the the tuner on the TV is not going to be able to to switch between stations as fast as you can scroll , so you know , the th the person might want to have a Might want to be able to scroll past television stations without seeing what is on them , in which case it just waits until you stop scrolling and then , you know , displays that station .
52221	0	a	What is a turbo button ?
52222	0	a	It con it controls the speed ?
52223	0	a	Yeah .
52224	0	a	Or they might want to scroll and and have a quick glimpse of it , even if it lags behind what they are doing .
52225	0	a	Yeah , so with this turbo button you can , say , skip over t channels if , you know , if I am if I am going if I am scrolling past them
52226	1	a	and you know , it is , you could have a little red light that comes up when they press it
52227	1	a	so they feel
52228	1	a	you know it is really going fast or whatever .
52229	0	a	So yeah , that is ,
52230	0	a	those are the two important features I think we need on the remote ,
52231	1	a	but I mean we can discuss about what other kind of buttons we need , .
52232	1	a	You know , i it could be , you know , if we if we want to have like a very cheap kind of device ,
52233	0	a	I mean , we could either consider that maybe we want to sell this as a very , if it is going to be a banana
52234	0	a	, you know that is a pretty gimmicky kind of thing that does not have that much functionality , it is just you know a couple of scroll wheels and a button
52235	0	a	cause it is hard to get so many buttons on a banana
52236	0	a	and it is still very
52237	0	a	it may even be for most for some people more functional than their current remote , but if they have these scroll wheels ,
52238	0	a	so , you know , what other buttons do we want ?
52239	0	a	I mean we could have
52240	0	a	well , I guess you need an on and off switch ,
52241	1	a	but you could you could o you could turn it turn it on by taking the top off the banana maybe , you know ,
52242	0	a	it is kind of like a spy kind of flick thing .
52243	0	a	It is enough .
52244	0	a	Switch on .
52245	0	a	Yeah .
52246	0	a	So sounds crazy .
52247	0	a	I like crazy ideas .
52248	0	a	That is why you are a marketing guru .
52249	0	a	Okay .
52250	0	a	Yeah , of course .
52251	0	a	So i it looks like we are going completely to forget about the LCD thing .
52252	0	a	Well , that is the thing ,
52253	0	a	as
52254	0	a	have we decided that we can only spend , , twenty five Euro ?
52255	0	a	Well not spend , but you know , charge twenty five Euro .
52256	0	a	I think that
52257	0	a	No we can we ca not use that .
52258	1	a	I I think we could use somehow the s coffee machine dialogue interface or so .
52259	0	a	You
52260	0	a	we can ?
52261	0	a	We ca not .
52262	0	a	We ca not use that to to comman co communicate ,
52263	0	a	it is just a thing
52264	0	a	No .
52265	0	a	Communicate .
52266	0	a	Yeah , but we can say channel twenty five .
52267	0	a	It is one way .
52268	0	a	No ?
52269	0	a	It is not a lot one hundred templates ,
52270	0	a	it is not
52271	0	a	, it is designed for a cof okay .
52272	0	a	But then you have to have a template for every channel , for a hundred channels ,
52273	0	a	you have to be able to to recognize
52274	0	a	Well , I f I think it is probably more than , than our can handle because it is designed for a coffee machine , you know , to say hello in the morning .
52275	0	a	Yeah .
52276	0	a	Is it design for a coffee machine ?
52277	0	a	Okay .
52278	0	a	Well that is its current application , I would presume that it is kind of , they would not design it to handle a hundred things th so .
52279	0	a	Yeah .
52280	0	a	Maybe you could ask your the
52281	1	a	you could ask the engineering department if we can
52282	0	a	Yeah .
52283	0	a	Yeah .
52284	0	a	A good good good thing .
52285	0	a	But
52286	0	a	Well I just I just made the point ,
52287	0	a	I do not I do not know if that speech recognition is , you know , even if we can do it
52288	0	a	, I think it is not really appropriate for television environment .
52289	1	a	You want to g to move to your slides ?
52290	0	a	You are finished ?
52291	0	a	Yeah I think so .
52292	0	a	Yeah , that is right , yeah .
52293	0	a	But I did have one thing from a previous meeting , you were talking about being able to find the remote control and I was talking about extendin being able to extend the remote control by having you know , a base station that can control other things as well .
52294	1	a	It might be useful to have some kind of base station , even if it is just you press on a button on it and and the remote control starts beeping , you know , this is a way of finding the remote .
52295	0	a	Y in that case maybe the maybe the speech recognition the speech thing could be useful just to say I am here
52296	0	a	but it is probably a bit of overkill if you could just have a a beeping
52297	0	a	It is speech
52298	0	a	It is it is speech synthesis and s
52299	0	a	it is speech kind of , not really speech recognition , but kind of pattern matching ,
52300	0	a	yeah
52301	0	a	yeah .
52302	0	a	Exactly yeah .
52303	0	a	So it is a speech synthesis kind of thing ,
52304	0	a	something has been stored and it is just spoken out .
52305	0	a	Yeah .
52306	0	a	That is right .
52307	0	a	Oh , good idea .
52308	0	a	Very good .
52309	1	a	Okay , let is move on .
52310	0	a	So you are two ?
52311	0	a	Okay .
52312	0	a	That is right .
52313	0	a	So this is going to be about the component design .
52314	0	a	So first thing is we need power source for the remote control .
52315	1	a	So I was of the idea that we can have two kind of power supplies , one is the usual batteries which are there ,
52316	0	a	they could be chargeable batteries if there is a basis station kind of thing
52317	1	a	and on top of that we can have solar cells ,
52318	0	a	when the lighting conditions are good they can be used so it will be pretty innovative kind .
52319	1	a	Then we need plastic with some elasticity so that if your if the remote control falls it is not broken directly into pieces , there should be some flexibility in t
52320	0	a	Yeah .
52321	0	a	I guess that fits in with the spongy kind of design philosophy .
52322	0	a	Yeah .
52323	0	a	So there should
52324	1	a	we should think of something like that
52325	1	a	and then it should be double curve .
52326	0	a	The s science for the ease of handling and there are some other issues why we need double curve .
52327	0	a	Then controls
52328	1	a	for the traditionals u traditional users we can have the push buttons so that they do not feel that it is an alien thing for them .
52329	0	a	So , just one second ,
52330	0	a	when you say double curve , what do you actually mean ?
52331	1	a	You reckon you could like draw us a thing on the , on the whiteboard
52332	0	a	cause I am not sure
52333	0	a	Okay ,
52334	0	a	but like , kind of convex or concave ?
52335	0	a	Double curve is , you have curves on both the sides if I am right .
52336	0	a	So it is symmetrical kind of thing , whatever it is .
52337	0	a	So , it could be curve , so it could be convex , conve concave , depending on what what we want .
52338	0	a	Okay .
52339	0	a	So there are flats , there are single curve and there are double curves .
52340	0	a	Okay .
52341	0	a	These are the three things , and there are different materials , with plastic you can have double curve but with certain other materials we cannot have double curve .
52342	0	a	So there there was there were many other materials like wood , titanium and all those things ,
52343	0	a	but plastic is I think is the most appropriate one ,
52344	0	a	it will bring the cost down
52345	0	a	and anyway it is Wooden cases
52346	0	a	Yeah .
52347	0	a	Although , you know , wood could be quite a stylish option ,
52348	1	a	if you take like , nice quality kind of wood that is got a nice grain
52349	1	a	and you kind of put some , some varnish on .
52350	0	a	but i
52351	0	a	but there is no elasticity
52352	0	a	which could be
52353	0	a	Yeah but the components inside .
52354	0	a	Well it depends ,
52355	0	a	I mean , you have the outs the wood itself is not going to break
52356	0	a	so you do not have to worry too much about the case being broken ,
52357	0	a	it is the inside .
52358	1	a	Yeah
52359	1	a	but inside you know you could have you can still have some kind of cushioning that is not visible to the to the user .
52360	0	a	Yeah .
52361	0	a	Very too expensive to do .
52362	0	a	Yeah .
52363	1	a	And I mean you could also , you can have just a very thin veneer of wood as well .
52364	0	a	And also
52365	0	a	Yeah but it is more easier to do a banana in plastic than in wood .
52366	0	a	That is true ,
52367	0	a	but are we set on the banana idea ?
52368	0	a	It is like a pumpkin or
52369	0	a	Green .
52370	0	a	Actually I was thinking that the the shape of a banana is not it is not really handy .
52371	0	a	Well it look like
52372	0	a	it looks like you are all targeting that
52373	0	a	yeah ?
52374	0	a	Yes it is .
52375	0	a	I do not know the name o o in English
52376	0	a	This
52377	0	a	it is not a fruit it is a vegetable .
52378	0	a	Is it an e apple which has
52379	0	a	Banana is more handier as compared to this I think , and to capsicum .
52380	0	a	Yeah ?
52381	0	a	Pumpkin .
52382	0	a	Green .
52383	0	a	Green .
52384	0	a	, yes I see .
52385	0	a	What does it taste like ?
52386	0	a	yeah ,
52387	0	a	is it
52388	0	a	what is it in French ?
52389	0	a	Yeah , okay , so capsicum or pepper .
52390	0	a	And you put in the salad .
52391	0	a	Pep pepperoni .
52392	0	a	Oui c'est ca
52393	0	a	Pepper .
52394	0	a	Poivron .
52395	0	a	pepper .
52396	0	a	Yeah .
52397	0	a	But they do d
52398	0	a	Yeah .
52399	0	a	And it is al it also suits with the double curve for easy of No ,
52400	0	a	I mean in a
52401	0	a	I am sure it is fun .
52402	0	a	I do not know , it seems a little bit kind of bulky to me , like
52403	0	a	like with a banana you can have
52404	0	a	Well
52405	0	a	But like a banana you can you can be holding like this and have the scroll wheel kind of on top and just roll it back and forth like that ,
52406	0	a	but with
52407	0	a	I do not know how you would hold a capsicum and
52408	0	a	So is that , when you say speaker support , you mean it just has some output pinned which which which kind of
52409	0	a	Okay ,
52410	0	a	but the speaker is actually attached to the to the chip in some way , or is just the the signal ?
52411	0	a	Okay .
52412	0	a	Yeah .
52413	0	a	It is not re it
52414	0	a	you you think it is really fancy and fun ?
52415	0	a	You think that young people that are
52416	0	a	Yeah .
52417	0	a	More than a banana ?
52418	0	a	Yeah .
52419	0	a	But banana is not so handy , I think that is handier .
52420	0	a	It is kind it is kind of it is more
52421	0	a	it is really ergonomic , it is fit in the hand and you have a lot of surface to to put the controls .
52422	1	a	Okay let is move on .
52423	0	a	Yeah you are right .
52424	0	a	So time is running ,
52425	1	a	let is move on .
52426	0	a	Okay , so push buttons for the traditional users so that they do not feel they are alienated ,
52427	0	a	just
52428	0	a	and a scroll button with push technology for channel selection , volume control and teletext browsing .
52429	0	a	These are the three scroll buttons which are already available with us in the company
52430	1	a	and we we can go ahead with that .
52431	0	a	Okay .
52432	1	a	Yeah , we can go to the next slide .
52433	0	a	Then there are different kind of chips , one one is the basic chip and the regular chip and one an adva advanced chip .
52434	1	a	So we can have regular chip for control .
52435	0	a	Pricing is a factor for us , that is why we will go for the regular chip .
52436	0	a	And regular chip supports speaker support ,
52437	1	a	so this functionality could be used for tracing the mobile phone which has been misplaced .
52438	0	a	It could be a beep kind of thing .
52439	0	a	Yes , yes , that is right , it is it is onto the chip , most most probably , not not hundred per cent sure about that .
52440	0	a	Okay .
52441	0	a	So are there any issues where we place this this chip to make sure you can actually hear the the speaker from the outside of the banana ?
52442	0	a	Okay .
52443	0	a	That will be the volume control I think which which a user shou it
52444	0	a	it should be already pre defined .
52445	0	a	It should be whatever will be the case , the chip is always going to be sitting inside .
52446	0	a	Yeah , but the speaker , if the speaker is actually on the chip , then if it is too far away from the the casing , or if the casing is too thick , then you may not hear the the speaker .
52447	1	a	, so we can have it at one of the boundaries so that things are slightly better .
52448	0	a	Yeah .
52449	0	a	As
52450	1	a	or as hearing is concerned , we can have some gap at some place ,
52451	0	a	so that
52452	0	a	That is right .
52453	0	a	Yeah .
52454	1	a	So that is something we have to keep in mind with the actual physical design is to keep the the speaker close enough to the outside .
52455	0	a	Okay .
52456	0	a	Yeah .
52457	0	a	So these these were the component selection and these things .
52458	1	a	We can go to the next slide .
52459	0	a	And these were the findings which I I saw with the web web , that user wants to have control more than one device wants to control more than one device from the same remote control ,
52460	1	a	so our TV remote can have little extra things to support additional devices like VCR DVD players which are usually attached with the TV ,
52461	0	a	because users are like this and they do not want to have one remote control for everything ,
52462	0	a	so with this additional little , we might be having slightly better market for us .
52463	0	a	Although , if
52464	1	a	It depends , if we like , if we are concentrating on like a fruit design , then maybe maybe we want to sell a collection of fruit , you know , like a different fruit for each device .
52465	0	a	Of fruits .
52466	0	a	Cause that , you know , that sometimes people like to collect you know things that of a similar type .
52467	0	a	Remotes
52468	0	a	objects , okay .
52469	0	a	S objects .
52470	0	a	Crazy objects .
52471	0	a	I think that would be funny at the beginning but after one month you will be tired of be surrounded of fruits .
52472	0	a	Well , you are the one who wanted to do fruit in the first place .
52473	1	a	No
52474	1	a	but I think just one fruit to control everything .
52475	0	a	Like a power fruit .
52476	0	a	A power fr a power M a Mando , a Supermando fruit .
52477	0	a	And as well as I could see on the web the scroll button is becoming really hot thing s
52478	1	a	and we should have it on the remote .
52479	0	a	Yeah .
52480	0	a	Okay .
52481	0	a	Actually I
52482	0	a	I did not understand very well this trace speaker lost control .
52483	0	a	Well
52484	0	a	I think that is a pretty handy feature .
52485	0	a	Okay , good .
52486	0	a	So you are having a basis station .
52487	0	a	Okay .
52488	0	a	Your
52489	0	a	usually your remote sits on that .
52490	0	a	So you
52491	0	a	and it is that is why it can have chargeable batteries .
52492	0	a	Now let is say
52493	0	a	Basis station is with the thing .
52494	0	a	So you you have to buy two things , the banana and the basis station .
52495	0	a	Bu it is it is .
52496	0	a	You s you you thing .
52497	0	a	It is like a telephone handset is there and the basis station for the telephone hand set is there .
52498	0	a	So now what user gets additionally he does not have to buy batteries , they are rechargeable batteries , so over the period of cor time he will recover the cost .
52499	0	a	So you are having the basis station and there is a button , if you press that button wherever the remote it will start beeping
52500	0	a	so you know where the remote is .
52501	0	a	Yeah .
52502	0	a	Yeah .
52503	0	a	I think it is kind of people would find that worth it even if it was not a recharging station , even if they did not have to buy extra batteries , you know .
52504	0	a	Yeah
52505	0	a	but I am a bit worried about the budget .
52506	0	a	So
52507	0	a	Although you do need to include RF kind of circuitry in the remote .
52508	0	a	this is
52509	0	a	basis station is nothing more , just it is a wire which is coming from the main cable and you are having one socket on which the thing sits .
52510	0	a	That is right .
52511	0	a	But all these things are usually in house so we do not have much problems .
52512	0	a	So component cost is going to be the least .
52513	0	a	Anyway , we are not using really advanced technology , LCD has already been ruled out , ASR has been ruled out .
52514	0	a	So it is the basic thing but very trendy and very user friendly .
52515	0	a	Okay .
52516	0	a	And
52517	0	a	I am just wondering actually , cause , you know ,
52518	0	a	I this whole fruit thing with the banana , it is it seemed like it first seems a bit kind of niche , like only a few people would really want a banana ,
52519	1	a	but what if it was kind of a stylised banana ?
52520	1	a	You know , rather than having it kind of you know yellow and really looking exactly like a banana , you could make it kind of silver .
52521	0	a	And , you know to give you kind of the idea of a banana
52522	0	a	but without it looking you know completely kitsch .
52523	0	a	For better want of a better word
52524	0	a	you know ?
52525	0	a	Well , you know , I don I do not know how many peop
52526	0	a	Well they
52527	0	a	Yeah , like this colour this colour
52528	0	a	Maybe , you know ,
52529	1	a	maybe like still in the shape of a banana .
52530	0	a	You think that yellow it is kitsch .
52531	0	a	If you make something that looks like a banana it should have the colour of a banana .
52532	0	a	Yeah .
52533	0	a	No , I I
52534	1	a	Maybe li like that .
52535	0	a	A
52536	0	a	yeah , otherwise it will be
52537	0	a	mis means you do not get b any feeling then .
52538	0	a	O otherwise
52539	0	a	Roughly .
52540	0	a	It is neither a banana nor a
52541	1	a	And going to the last slide .
52542	0	a	No , exactly .
52543	0	a	Exactly .
52544	1	a	, but you know , just maybe maybe not exactly the same texture as a banana
52545	0	a	and just kind of , you know
52546	0	a	because the thing is it is going to be a little bit difficult to make to give like the texture of a banana anyway and to k to have the exact shape .
52547	0	a	I think if you are going to not be able to do it properly
52548	0	a	you may as well do it in a stylised way that just looks a bit more kind of , you know , twenty first century rather than sixties or seventies .
52549	0	a	Yeah .
52550	1	a	Okay .
52551	1	a	Let is move on .
52552	0	a	yeah .
52553	1	a	Before before st before ending the meeting I would like to to draw some sketch about the pro future prot prototype .
52554	0	a	Okay .
52555	1	a	Go for it .
52556	0	a	Okay .
52557	0	a	Well no , not not you ,
52558	1	a	you can finish your slides before
52559	0	a	okay .
52560	0	a	Okay .
52561	0	a	Okay ,
52562	0	a	so .
52563	0	a	Anyway , users will be
52564	0	a	so the findings is users will be very interested in our locator device to find their misplaced remotes .
52565	0	a	So that was very
52566	0	a	I thought it is a very good suggestion by everybody .
52567	0	a	Okay .
52568	0	a	That is it .
52569	0	a	That is all ?
52570	0	a	Okay , so
52571	0	a	so well done for the presentations .
52572	0	a	Yep .
52573	1	a	So we need to take some de decisions about about what we are going to do .
52574	1	a	So I I propose that you go to the whiteboard and we are going to report all the ideas we had we had during this these presentations just to draw some sketch about what will be the prod final product
52575	0	a	and where Superman go banana and
52576	0	a	extra func functionalities such as wheels , the speaker unit well not in order not to lost the the device ,
52577	0	a	I do I do not remember you call it ?
52578	0	a	Basis station , yeah .
52579	0	a	Yeah .
52580	0	a	Okay .
52581	0	a	That is right .
52582	0	a	The basis station .
52583	0	a	That is right .
52584	0	a	so
52585	0	a	so we are going for a stylish banana shape .
52586	0	a	Yeah ,
52587	0	a	so , I guess you want to hold like the way
52588	1	a	the end of the banana you want to kind of hold as ma you maybe want to kind of hold like a gun rather than cause you do not want it to point kind of towards the floor .
52589	0	a	Yeah , right .
52590	0	a	So
52591	0	a	you know , so if you have like
52592	0	a	Okay ,
52593	0	a	so
52594	0	a	So
52595	0	a	okay ,
52596	1	a	so I guess we need , you know , something that can fit a banana shaped object .
52597	1	a	What about what about this shape ?
52598	1	a	More or less .
52599	0	a	We I if it i if it has really the model shape of a bana
52600	0	a	you could
52601	0	a	the the starting is good but it could it should have more the shape of a banana if you want to point really a at the thing .
52602	0	a	There is less space on this to put with the buttons .
52603	0	a	Yeah ,
52604	0	a	but how many buttons do we need ?
52605	0	a	What a What about
52606	0	a	Four millions ?
52607	0	a	What about a
52608	1	a	I wo what about adding the this word spotting , keyword spotting recognition saying volume up volume down ?
52609	0	a	It is too difficult but people like innovation and that is really innovative and I do not know if it would cost a lot , just a few five words .
52610	0	a	If you do not want to to to do that movement which is which is difficult
52611	0	a	if you do not have to do it in fact , it is better .
52612	0	a	what about a
52613	0	a	The base station .
52614	0	a	So ti time is running ,
52615	1	a	we have to we have to we have to to move forward .
52616	1	a	So let is skip to this this this this idea .
52617	0	a	Yeah .
52618	0	a	So we have this .
52619	0	a	We have a a basis ,
52620	0	a	how do you call it ?
52621	0	a	A base station .
52622	0	a	Right .
52623	0	a	We will have a base station extra on the side .
52624	0	a	Yeah .
52625	0	a	Yeah .
52626	0	a	, we have a RF for for beeping for beeping .
52627	0	a	That is right , yeah , we need that , yeah .
52628	0	a	We need b RF to beep .
52629	0	a	Okay , so it is
52630	0	a	Yeah .
52631	0	a	So we that means we need a button on th on the on the basis .
52632	0	a	Basis station .
52633	0	a	Basis station ,
52634	0	a	thank you .
52635	0	a	Yeah ,
52636	0	a	yeah .
52637	0	a	Alright , so we need
52638	0	a	okay .
52639	1	a	Can you go quickly please ?
52640	0	a	Okay .
52641	0	a	Yeah .
52642	0	a	So we are going to add also you as you suggested the whee some wheels to control the volumes and channels and your tur turbo turbo button .
52643	0	a	Yeah .
52644	0	a	Yeah , which I think it is it is probably best actually on the on the underneath of the the device ,
52645	0	a	so you have
52646	0	a	Yes .
52647	0	a	Turbo button .
52648	0	a	Yeah ,
52649	1	a	on the th
52650	1	a	yeah , maybe here .
52651	1	a	And the and the wheel a a at the level of the thumb for instance .
52652	0	a	Yeah , so you have the thumb kind of here .
52653	0	a	And and you have two wheels .
52654	0	a	So yeah , you need one one here and one on on the other side , so you got volume an and channel .
52655	0	a	Okay right .
52656	0	a	Good .
52657	0	a	And ,
52658	0	a	No LCD .
52659	0	a	So no LCD .
52660	0	a	Okay great .
52661	0	a	Very good .
52662	0	a	Okay .
52663	0	a	Oh we need a
52664	0	a	we need a power on off switch as well .
52665	0	a	Yeah .
52666	0	a	for the remote ?
52667	0	a	Remotes do not have power on off switch .
52668	0	a	Yeah .
52669	0	a	Oh , just the switch , no f not for the TV for the TV .
52670	0	a	Yeah .
52671	0	a	so you
52672	0	a	On the side .
52673	0	a	Okay .
52674	0	a	S
52675	0	a	no , that will be controlled by the
52676	0	a	those buttons will be there already , yeah .
52677	0	a	Where ?
52678	0	a	Okay .
52679	0	a	Means on the remote .
52680	0	a	Because remote is going to have both the interfaces , scroll as well as buttons .
52681	0	a	They are not going to cost you much , everything is in house
52682	0	a	and now you do not want the traditional users to be apprehensive of this .
52683	0	a	Well , I dunno if the traditional user is going to buy a a banana remote in the first place , you know .
52684	0	a	Oh , yeah .
52685	0	a	That is that is another issue which I did not think of .
52686	0	a	Y
52687	0	a	I mean you need to kind of keep it
52688	0	a	Yeah , how many of these did we want to sell ?
52689	0	a	I ca not remember ,
52690	0	a	Yeah , but how many units did we need to to sell ?
52691	0	a	Four point four million .
52692	0	a	But you know our targets are very high , means fifty million Euros is the profit which we want make .
52693	0	a	Twenty five .
52694	0	a	Twelve point five is the profit on one .
52695	0	a	Twenty five .
52696	0	a	forty th four .
52697	0	a	Point point four million ?
52698	0	a	Point four million .
52699	0	a	That is a lot of fruit .
52700	0	a	Yeah .
52701	0	a	In the market .
52702	0	a	So .
52703	0	a	Well .
52704	0	a	No .
52705	0	a	Time is running ,
52706	1	a	we have to close the meeting in a few minutes .
52707	0	a	Okay .
52708	0	a	So , okay , the next step ,
52709	1	a	you can come back to your seat .
52710	0	a	Okay .
52711	0	a	The next step is to go for to f is to go to to building a prototype , based on this ,
52712	0	a	okay ?
52713	0	a	So next meeting you guys have to prepare the followi things .
52714	0	a	Okay .
52715	0	a	You have to work on the look and feel design and you have to work on the user interface , in fact you two you have to work together to model the first f first prototype .
52716	0	a	Marketing Expert have to go to product evaluation .
52717	0	a	Okay ?
52718	0	a	It is too difficult .
52719	0	a	It is not a possi it will not be possible to implement it for the next prototype ,
52720	0	a	so t it is in the next prototype
52721	1	a	so let is skip it .
52722	0	a	Okay .
52723	1	a	For the future prototypes .
52724	0	a	Yeah , maybe ,
52725	1	a	for the n if if if it it works well , we will go for an orange one .
52726	0	a	That can be the t
52727	0	a	That can be like the turbo banana plus plus commando .
52728	0	a	Yeah yeah , honour the fruit .
52729	0	a	Plus plus
52730	0	a	, okay .
52731	0	a	Okay .
52732	0	a	Thanks very much .
52733	0	a	We will see n next meeting .
52734	0	a	Bye .
52735	0	a	So meeting is over ?
52736	0	a	Okay .
52737	0	a	Okay .
52738	0	a	Yep .
52739	0	a	Okay .
52740	0	a	Okay .
52741	0	a	Thank you .
52742	0	a	 
52743	0	a	Okay .
52744	0	a	Good afternoon again .
52745	0	a	So we should have our final meeting about the detail designed of detail design of the product of the remote control .
52746	0	a	So here is the agenda for today .
52747	1	a	just going to go quickly through the minutes of the last last meeting
52748	0	a	then we have a p presentation of prototype of you two ,
52749	0	a	sounds interesting .
52750	0	a	And we will have presentation of evaluation crit criteria by ou our Marketing Experts .
52751	0	a	Then we will have to go through finance evaluation of the of the cost of the thing
52752	0	a	and hopefully we should fit the target o tw of twelve point five Euro .
52753	0	a	Okay .
52754	1	a	So let is go .
52755	1	a	if I go quickly through the minutes of the last meeting .
52756	0	a	So we went through th
52757	0	a	w we took this following decisions .
52758	0	a	No LCD , no speech recognition technology , okay , we went through a b to a banana look and feel for the remote control .
52759	0	a	We went through the use of wheels and but buttons .
52760	0	a	And also the use of a basis station for battery ch charging and also to call the to call the mot mote remote control when it is lost .
52761	0	a	Okay .
52762	0	a	Good .
52763	1	a	So guys let this wonderful thing .
52764	1	a	Okay so we can go to the slides .
52765	0	a	Oh yeah .
52766	0	a	Sorry .
52767	0	a	Yeah .
52768	0	a	Number three .
52769	0	a	Oh number two
52770	0	a	sorry .
52771	0	a	Which is
52772	1	a	Yeah can you show it to the the camera maybe .
52773	0	a	So final design .
52774	0	a	Final design .
52775	0	a	Okay so
52776	1	a	Michael you can go ahead .
52777	0	a	Yeah
52778	0	a	so following our decision to make a yellow well to make a banana remote
52779	0	a	okay
52780	0	a	so
52781	0	a	we actually have a
52782	0	a	We have
52783	0	a	well first first of all we made a an attractive base station with a banana leaf look and feel and
52784	0	a	bana sit
52785	0	a	the banana sits in there k you know nicely weighted so that it is not going to tip over
52786	0	a	and this is the remote itself , it is kind of
52787	0	a	it is it is ergonomic , it fits in the hand rather well .
52788	1	a	You can pull it out first , maybe .
52789	0	a	We have got the two scroll wheels here which you know one on the the left for the volume and the one on the right for for the channel and underneath we have the the turbo button which is in like a nice trigger position for you know for pressing quite naturally .
52790	0	a	What is the use of the t turbo button already ?
52791	0	a	yeah yeah
52792	0	a	an then you stop when you stop it stops .
52793	0	a	This is when you when you are scrolling the through the channels you can tell it to to skip th past channels that you quickly rather th
52794	0	a	Yeah .
52795	0	a	Well when you stop scrolling the wheel it stops .
52796	0	a	But normally with it will just s stay on each station briefly
52797	0	a	so you can see the the picture .
52798	0	a	And we we do have one more functionality .
52799	0	a	Uh huh .
52800	0	a	If you take the banana as such and you press the turbo button , so it switch ons the switch ons the TV .
52801	0	a	The TV yeah .
52802	0	a	Which one ?
52803	0	a	Okay .
52804	0	a	The s the turbo button .
52805	0	a	The turbo button .
52806	0	a	So rather than having an extra button for for the on off switch you just use the turbo button .
52807	0	a	Additional button .
52808	0	a	What this button for ?
52809	0	a	Okay .
52810	0	a	This is a teletext button .
52811	0	a	So once you press that then you get teletext and you can use the the channel selector scroll wheel as
52812	0	a	To navigate
52813	0	a	yeah .
52814	0	a	To navigate it through th through teletext .
52815	0	a	But if you want to go to page seven hundred ?
52816	0	a	How man
52817	0	a	I do not understand it .
52818	0	a	That is right , that is right .
52819	0	a	Yeah .
52820	0	a	with the wheel it is easy .
52821	0	a	Well then you can you you have like a little number selection thing , you press the the the teletext button to move between the fields and then you can just scroll the number back and forth
52822	0	a	so you have s
52823	0	a	you go
52824	0	a	you scroll to seven and then zero
52825	0	a	zero
52826	0	a	and then you can
52827	0	a	Well you can you can press press the teletext button
52828	0	a	and then you then you
52829	0	a	can you can f
52830	0	a	And this is the the infrared port .
52831	0	a	Can you repeat it ?
52832	0	a	Yeah .
52833	0	a	So then then both the scroll buttons they are for teletext browsing .
52834	0	a	And you can tele
52835	0	a	yeah ,
52836	0	a	once you press the teletext button then the scroll buttons they are more for teletext , they are no more for channel or vol volume .
52837	0	a	okay okay .
52838	0	a	Okay .
52839	0	a	Okay okay .
52840	0	a	Okay .
52841	0	a	I see .
52842	0	a	I see .
52843	0	a	Yeah .
52844	0	a	Okay .
52845	0	a	Okay .
52846	0	a	That is right .
52847	0	a	Also the top of the banana .
52848	0	a	Yeah .
52849	0	a	Excellent .
52850	0	a	So .
52851	0	a	And then we have
52852	0	a	in the in the base station we have the the button at the front for for calling the the banana .
52853	0	a	Calling .
52854	0	a	Yeah .
52855	0	a	Excellent .
52856	0	a	And the the leaves plays the roles of of antennas ?
52857	0	a	Oh .
52858	0	a	Actually they do .
52859	0	a	That is that is
52860	0	a	yeah that is that is form and function in the one in the one object .
52861	0	a	Yeah .
52862	0	a	So it always means , whatever the rays goes by they they get reflected and then you are having a better coverage .
52863	0	a	It is like antennas .
52864	0	a	Yeah .
52865	0	a	So .
52866	0	a	But yeah that is that is just like
52867	0	a	that is an attractive base station .
52868	0	a	Great .
52869	0	a	So .
52870	0	a	Okay .
52871	0	a	So , what else ?
52872	0	a	Yeah , they are light .
52873	0	a	And for the power source we are having solar cells and rechargeable batteries and this and the basis station is going to have the input from the power line for for charging the batteries .
52874	0	a	Is it really weight ?
52875	0	a	Is it light or
52876	0	a	Okay .
52877	0	a	It is very light .
52878	0	a	It is it is it is about the weight of a banana .
52879	0	a	Okay .
52880	0	a	You know , to give you the correct look and feel .
52881	0	a	Yeah .
52882	0	a	Ok Okay .
52883	0	a	And we have put these different colours so that people do not mistake them mistake it as a banana .
52884	0	a	Otherwise it is you know a child comes and so
52885	0	a	Yeah .
52886	0	a	Yeah
52887	0	a	yeah
52888	0	a	yeah
52889	0	a	, I see .
52890	0	a	I under I understand .
52891	0	a	I think a child would try to eat it anyway ,
52892	1	a	so maybe we should consider that .
52893	0	a	maybe health and safety aspects .
52894	0	a	yeah .
52895	0	a	Oh we did not think of that yet .
52896	0	a	Yeah .
52897	0	a	Yeah .
52898	0	a	So for the power source , apparently you still you
52899	0	a	you want to use both solar cells and batteries .
52900	0	a	Oh yeah that is right .
52901	0	a	you mean
52902	0	a	okay .
52903	0	a	So
52904	0	a	Yeah ,
52905	0	a	where are going to
52906	0	a	where are you are you going to place them ?
52907	0	a	You have enough surface ?
52908	0	a	You
52909	0	a	Okay .
52910	0	a	I do not really know if the solar cells are actually necessary any more if you have a recharging base station .
52911	0	a	It will It will be always at top somewhere at there .
52912	0	a	If I was going to place them I would put them on the on the top here since that is like the black bit
52913	0	a	but
52914	0	a	yeah
52915	0	a	I do not
52916	0	a	I really do not think it is necessary to have the solar cells anymore .
52917	0	a	Yeah
52918	0	a	because now we are having rechargeable batteries
52919	0	a	so that that is .
52920	0	a	What will be the autonomy ?
52921	0	a	Roughly ?
52922	0	a	The autonomy .
52923	0	a	The what sorry ?
52924	0	a	What do you mean ?
52925	0	a	Autonomy .
52926	0	a	I mean how long does i how how how long can it be held off a station ?
52927	0	a	Yeah .
52928	0	a	How long the
52929	0	a	how long the bit the batteries long .
52930	0	a	A long time .
52931	0	a	Eight to ten eight to ten hours .
52932	0	a	A long
52933	0	a	Yeah ,
52934	0	a	so it is It is used only when you
52935	0	a	Yeah .
52936	0	a	No no no ,
52937	0	a	it can
52938	0	a	it should be weeks .
52939	0	a	N most
52940	0	a	no most of the time it is not being used .
52941	0	a	Yeah but y people do not like to put it back in the base station all the time people leave want to leave it on the couch so
52942	0	a	, okay .
52943	0	a	So when when you are making it on
52944	0	a	No eight or eight or ten hours of working .
52945	0	a	If you are just leaving like that it will be much longer .
52946	0	a	Okay .
52947	0	a	F weeks .
52948	0	a	Yeah .
52949	0	a	Yeah .
52950	0	a	That is right .
52951	0	a	Right .
52952	1	a	Next slide ?
52953	0	a	Okay .
52954	0	a	Yeah .
52955	0	a	And we are having the speakers regular chip for control .
52956	0	a	Pricing is was a factor so that is why we have gone for a regular chip only not the advanced chip .
52957	0	a	And that is it .
52958	0	a	Okay .
52959	0	a	Those really sounds very good .
52960	0	a	That is right .
52961	0	a	Nothing else to add ?
52962	0	a	Yeah .
52963	0	a	It seems to be falling over .
52964	0	a	I
52965	0	a	l
52966	0	a	yeah .
52967	0	a	I like I like it .
52968	0	a	Maybe the the thing that convince me the less is the the multifunctional buttons .
52969	0	a	Looks a bit
52970	0	a	Looks a bit puzzled
52971	0	a	I dunno how to say that .
52972	0	a	You want to have more functional buttons ?
52973	0	a	You are not convinced .
52974	0	a	You the the b the buttons change h h their function depending if y it is teletext or not
52975	0	a	And the volume button will will become And what about people who want to use digits ?
52976	0	a	Butto real buttons ?
52977	0	a	Okay .
52978	0	a	Not not many , we we want to keep it simple .
52979	0	a	So that this button fo is for teletext which is usually also the case , that usually there is a teletext button and once you press that , the channel buttons , they baco become the scrolling buttons .
52980	0	a	It is up to you , means .
52981	0	a	Now that
52982	1	a	Means let is say this this can move the the larger digits and this can move the smaller digits .
52983	0	a	Well in fact b both will be could be useful , navigating through teletext .
52984	1	a	Or can move between positions in the in the number .
52985	0	a	That is right .
52986	0	a	Yeah .
52987	0	a	Wow .
52988	0	a	Yeah .
52989	0	a	So there was there was a constraint that the surface area which we have on this banana on one side because of the shape .
52990	0	a	So we are targeting a segment which is which is just very trendy kind of thing , they they do not care about the buttons any more .
52991	0	a	And anyway
52992	0	a	Evalua
52993	0	a	yeah .
52994	0	a	Because have you thought about configuration and all this kind of stuff ?
52995	0	a	It is all automatic .
52996	0	a	It is all automatic .
52997	0	a	Yep .
52998	0	a	Okay .
52999	0	a	Okay yeah
53000	0	a	it is fine .
53001	0	a	Very good yeah
53002	0	a	you th
53003	0	a	yeah .
53004	0	a	W we are living in a wonderful world .
53005	0	a	Bananas everywhere .
53006	0	a	Okay , so
53007	0	a	So we have to go through now evaluations .
53008	0	a	Automatically configure .
53009	0	a	Yeah .
53010	0	a	So your slides are ready ?
53011	0	a	you are four I think .
53012	0	a	S
53013	0	a	Yeah .
53014	0	a	So this is one , which one is this one ?
53015	0	a	Num number
53016	0	a	So to have in order to have enough granularity it is in order to have enough granularity in the evaluation .
53017	0	a	Yeah .
53018	0	a	Okay .
53019	0	a	I I const
53020	0	a	I constructed a a list of criteria based on the on the general user requirements .
53021	0	a	And each criteria is will be evaluated it is logical criteria so we must users must say i if it is true or is or if it is false in a in a scale ranging from zero to seven .
53022	0	a	Why this strange factor of seven ?
53023	0	a	Usually I have seen that scales are from one to ten .
53024	0	a	Because i
53025	0	a	I am sorry .
53026	0	a	Sorry .
53027	0	a	yeah .
53028	0	a	It is from
53029	0	a	sorry ,
53030	0	a	it is from one to seven .
53031	0	a	It is from from one to seven
53032	0	a	sorry .
53033	0	a	Because it should be an even it should be an even scale , and five is too short and nine is too long .
53034	0	a	Okay .
53035	0	a	Okay .
53036	0	a	Okay .
53037	0	a	Okay fine , got the idea .
53038	0	a	I am a I I am
53039	0	a	Sorry ?
53040	0	a	Yeah yeah .
53041	0	a	Okay .
53042	0	a	The variance is mi it is is minimal .
53043	0	a	Okay .
53044	0	a	Okay , okay , great .
53045	0	a	I am answering your question .
53046	0	a	Okay .
53047	0	a	Okay .
53048	0	a	Yeah yeah .
53049	1	a	Go ahead .
53050	0	a	And that is the criteria
53051	0	a	I
53052	0	a	I found more useful .
53053	1	a	I think I sh
53054	1	a	I
53055	1	a	I could write the criteria in the on the whiteboard ?
53056	1	a	And we all four could range could evaluate the
53057	0	a	Okay let is let is evaluate if it is fancy or Seven but
53058	0	a	I would say seven .
53059	0	a	Sure .
53060	0	a	Okay .
53061	0	a	Yeah yeah .
53062	0	a	Yeah .
53063	0	a	Okay .
53064	0	a	So you can say fancy , handy .
53065	0	a	Handy .
53066	0	a	Yeah , it is fancy , according to me .
53067	0	a	Yeah , six .
53068	0	a	Seven .
53069	0	a	S seven .
53070	0	a	Seven by me .
53071	0	a	Six .
53072	0	a	Okay .
53073	0	a	It is quite fancy .
53074	1	a	So you can add seven plus six plus seven plus
53075	0	a	Five .
53076	0	a	No , wait .
53077	0	a	Yeah five .
53078	0	a	What do you say seven ?
53079	0	a	Five ?
53080	0	a	Okay , six point five .
53081	0	a	Five , maybe maybe maybe six
53082	0	a	it is it is
53083	0	a	I guess it is
53084	0	a	yeah .
53085	0	a	Handy ?
53086	0	a	Seven .
53087	0	a	Again I will give seven .
53088	0	a	I would give it a six like I
53089	0	a	would I think it is probably more handy than my current remote , cause of the scroll wheels but maybe loses the point for not having you know the extra buttons when you reall if you do need them for some reason
53090	0	a	but you know you can always use your other remote .
53091	0	a	Six .
53092	0	a	Yep .
53093	0	a	So seven , seven , six ,
53094	0	a	six point five .
53095	0	a	Seven for me .
53096	0	a	Yeah .
53097	0	a	Six .
53098	0	a	Functional .
53099	0	a	I will give five .
53100	0	a	Four .
53101	0	a	I would say Everything ar everything
53102	0	a	It is compared to the all remote controls .
53103	0	a	Well it depends when you say functional
53104	0	a	, do you mean it does what we want it to do , or d does what it does
53105	0	a	, you know , can it make you coffee ?
53106	0	a	You know .
53107	0	a	for a remote control , does he have all the you could expect .
53108	0	a	Yeah .
53109	0	a	Yeah .
53110	0	a	That is right .
53111	0	a	That is right .
53112	0	a	That is before
53113	0	a	Yeah .
53114	0	a	The standards .
53115	0	a	What is available in the market off the shelf .
53116	0	a	I have to say four .
53117	0	a	Actually I do not know what are the r the real specification of a of a universal remote contro
53118	0	a	it is not an univer but it is for all kind of TVs ?
53119	0	a	Yeah .
53120	0	a	Well it is not a universal remote .
53121	0	a	Remember we are focus we are supposed to focus just on TVs .
53122	0	a	We
53123	0	a	Five .
53124	0	a	Yeah .
53125	0	a	Well all TVs but only T only TVs I guess .
53126	0	a	So it is universal but for TVs .
53127	0	a	So s four ?
53128	0	a	Five ?
53129	0	a	Four .
53130	0	a	Four .
53131	0	a	Four .
53132	0	a	Four .
53133	0	a	So four point two ?
53134	0	a	four .
53135	0	a	Just four .
53136	0	a	Four .
53137	0	a	So four ?
53138	0	a	It means cool features , like new features actually .
53139	0	a	Obviously there are some outliers so
53140	0	a	Which
53141	0	a	I will say five .
53142	0	a	Okay cool ?
53143	0	a	Cool device .
53144	0	a	There I will give it seven .
53145	0	a	That is right .
53146	0	a	For a TV the most important feature which I felt was the locator which is a cool feature .
53147	0	a	And then the scroll buttons are again cool features .
53148	0	a	We do not have LCD for it but that we decided we do not want to have .
53149	0	a	Yeah .
53150	0	a	Seven .
53151	0	a	I would say five .
53152	0	a	Six .
53153	0	a	Seven .
53154	0	a	Plus six , I say I said seven .
53155	0	a	Yeah .
53156	0	a	So it is six .
53157	0	a	S
53158	0	a	yeah .
53159	0	a	You said seven ?
53160	0	a	Five .
53161	0	a	Yeah .
53162	0	a	Cause it is five five seven seven so
53163	0	a	, okay , definitely easy to use .
53164	0	a	Okay .
53165	0	a	Definitely seven .
53166	0	a	Seven .
53167	0	a	Seven .
53168	0	a	Seven .
53169	0	a	And you ?
53170	0	a	Outl you are not lik outlier .
53171	0	a	Seven
53172	0	a	Okay okay
53173	0	a	okay
53174	0	a	okay .
53175	0	a	Sorry ,
53176	0	a	I have them
53177	0	a	Of cour Of course the most difficult question for the end .
53178	0	a	Okay .
53179	0	a	Alright , now here is the sixty million Dollar question , well , twenty five twenty five Euro question .
53180	0	a	Of course I will buy the banana .
53181	0	a	What do you what do you guys reckon ?
53182	0	a	I will say five .
53183	0	a	Well
53184	0	a	Twenty five Euros .
53185	0	a	I will say five .
53186	0	a	I find it quite cheap actually .
53187	0	a	I dunno .
53188	0	a	If i i it depends , if you live in in Switzerland or you live in
53189	0	a	I do not know .
53190	0	a	Cheap .
53191	0	a	Yeah ,
53192	0	a	so the target price is for all Europe , or only for rich countries ?
53193	0	a	It is more targeting UK or So this is selling costs , not production costs .
53194	0	a	Wha the initial specifications were for the whole all Europe or
53195	0	a	Yeah this is the the initial specifications .
53196	0	a	Yeah .
53197	0	a	Yeah .
53198	0	a	Yeah
53199	0	a	yeah sure .
53200	0	a	Five .
53201	0	a	I would say six .
53202	0	a	It is quite cheap actually .
53203	0	a	I would say two .
53204	0	a	Why ?
53205	0	a	No
53206	0	a	but it is really handy actually if you see .
53207	0	a	I do not want a banana on my living room table , a banana remote .
53208	0	a	Aw , should be nice in your It is kitsch .
53209	0	a	It is handy , it is handy , but it it is terrible .
53210	0	a	It is it is so handy .
53211	0	a	And then
53212	0	a	Anyb anybody who comes here anybody who comes to your home he will at least ask once what is this .
53213	0	a	Yeah .
53214	0	a	Yeah , but it is not a positive thing .
53215	0	a	It is a very positive thing if you see like that .
53216	0	a	Well , you know , it is it is handy , it is ergonomic , but it is a banana .
53217	0	a	Well , do not forget well , do not for
53218	0	a	do not forget who we are targeting also
53219	0	a	who are f f who are wh
53220	0	a	yeah ,
53221	0	a	youngst youngst
53222	0	a	No
53223	0	a	well yeah
53224	0	a	I
53225	0	a	if you would be young .
53226	0	a	Youngsters .
53227	0	a	Actually maybe
53228	0	a	Yeah
53229	0	a	I change the question .
53230	0	a	Yeah
53231	0	a	but it says
53232	0	a	I
53233	0	a	, I would buy this , so .
53234	0	a	Not telling that you are young .
53235	0	a	Li li like a teenager for instance .
53236	0	a	No , it is I .
53237	0	a	Okay
53238	0	a	you are you are crazy teenager and you like fun things .
53239	0	a	I would buy
53240	0	a	S s
53241	0	a	Still I I would say two .
53242	0	a	You want to flaunt .
53243	0	a	Yeah .
53244	0	a	You with your girlfriend or something .
53245	0	a	Yeah , you want to show the beautiful banana you have .
53246	0	a	Or might be it does some other kind of thing but
53247	0	a	yeah , crazy .
53248	0	a	I do not think I at any stage in my life I would want a banana remote control , really .
53249	0	a	Okay so you s you give
53250	0	a	oh yeah
53251	0	a	yeah
53252	0	a	I know
53253	0	a	I know .
53254	0	a	I can say , maybe there is a market for it , I dunno .
53255	0	a	So you say two .
53256	0	a	Yeah .
53257	0	a	I say five .
53258	0	a	F
53259	0	a	I d I say five .
53260	0	a	You say ?
53261	0	a	So what is the new question ?
53262	0	a	yeah , I think so .
53263	0	a	And you have saved it ?
53264	0	a	You will have to reload .
53265	1	a	So yeah upload the
53266	0	a	Yeah it is two different situations
53267	0	a	Okay , so , it depends if If I had t if I had to spend twenty five Euro , if that was like my limit , maybe I would buy it .
53268	0	a	If you really need an universal remote control or if you would change your remote control for a n for a new one .
53269	0	a	Yeah that is two different question .
53270	0	a	Because the other twenty five Euro remote controls are probably going to look worse than a banana .
53271	0	a	They are not going to be as
53272	0	a	And they they might not be a as easy as this
53273	0	a	yeah .
53274	0	a	Ugly .
53275	0	a	And it
53276	0	a	yeah this is going to f you know handy to use .
53277	0	a	Yeah .
53278	0	a	So ?
53279	0	a	What now ?
53280	0	a	What range ?
53281	0	a	Six .
53282	0	a	S
53283	0	a	I go slightly up .
53284	0	a	I stick to five .
53285	0	a	Although it still has it still has the word of course at the beginning
53286	0	a	so I dunno .
53287	0	a	Six .
53288	0	a	W we have six , five Three
53289	0	a	So we are
53290	0	a	six , five , four
53291	0	a	Yeah .
53292	0	a	I would give it I would give it a
53293	0	a	I give it a four now .
53294	0	a	Six ? Six
53295	0	a	? Six ,
53296	0	a	so it is five point five , or less .
53297	0	a	Six , five , four .
53298	0	a	So
53299	0	a	So and last question ,
53300	0	a	will I change my rem change my remote control from Mando banana .
53301	0	a	Okay .
53302	0	a	, zero .
53303	0	a	No we ca not .
53304	0	a	So one .
53305	0	a	Actually yeah ,
53306	0	a	I we
53307	0	a	Five ?
53308	0	a	You are romantic , really .
53309	0	a	Well if .
53310	0	a	No let is say I will put two .
53311	0	a	Yeah .
53312	0	a	I would say three ,
53313	0	a	I mean my remote control is kind of at home is pretty terrible .
53314	0	a	If it was change my remote control of my DVD player for a Mando banana then I would be more inclined to
53315	0	a	but cause it is really bad but
53316	0	a	I would say a three .
53317	0	a	It is for the TV .
53318	0	a	I will still give it five .
53319	0	a	Yeah .
53320	0	a	Two three five two three fi and two .
53321	0	a	I would say two .
53322	0	a	So it is somewhere three point five I think .
53323	0	a	So it is r
53324	0	a	Yeah , three point five .
53325	0	a	Who is the outlier ?
53326	0	a	Wh wh
53327	0	a	you said five ?
53328	0	a	I do not know if it is a No because there are more
53329	1	a	yeah , we should not sum like that .
53330	0	a	No I said five .
53331	0	a	No no you say five , he is the outlier .
53332	1	a	Okay just just do a sum .
53333	0	a	It is not very promising but
53334	0	a	you know we are not young trendsetters .
53335	1	a	Well maybe we should we should have a look globally glob
53336	0	a	Yeah .
53337	0	a	Because the the last two questions is much more important than the rest actually .
53338	0	a	Otherwise we would not we will not sell .
53339	0	a	Is there some some formula you are using that says you have to sum them up ?
53340	1	a	Well just leave it at that then .
53341	0	a	no I did not anything .
53342	0	a	Oops .
53343	0	a	Yeah ,
53344	0	a	the
53345	0	a	Yeah .
53346	1	a	So maybe maybe w we can we should stick to general feeling .
53347	1	a	We can had have a out of these numbers , which which is that well we should go for it .
53348	0	a	Do you want me to sum
53349	0	a	o I think it is not S
53350	0	a	Actually what is the differen
53351	0	a	Too expensive .
53352	0	a	Problem with connectors ?
53353	0	a	Okay
53354	0	a	No .
53355	0	a	I think it it kind of you just lose information if you sum it , so .
53356	0	a	Yeah it is it is funny .
53357	1	a	So let is move let is move on .
53358	0	a	Yeah , sure .
53359	0	a	Okay , now now we have to to estimate the cost
53360	0	a	okay .
53361	0	a	So I prepare an Excel sh an Excel sheet .
53362	0	a	well we are going to calculate the production costs .
53363	0	a	We should we should be below twelve point five .
53364	0	a	So I already put some pu some numbers here , okay .
53365	1	a	We are going to go through
53366	0	a	so this is the number the number of components we need for this thing .
53367	0	a	So it appears that there were things that we did not thought about .
53368	0	a	and also things
53369	0	a	that
53370	0	a	I
53371	0	a	I
53372	0	a	d I forget to to put like solar cells .
53373	0	a	Well we decided against the solar cells so
53374	0	a	You mean , charging it by shaking the banana .
53375	0	a	Oh yeah finally we say no .
53376	0	a	Solar cells ,
53377	0	a	yeah
53378	0	a	yeah
53379	0	a	yeah
53380	0	a	yeah
53381	0	a	yeah , we said no to that .
53382	1	a	Okay so let is let is go let is go let go through all the lines .
53383	0	a	So hand dynamo .
53384	0	a	This something we did not thought about .
53385	0	a	But
53386	0	a	Yeah .
53387	0	a	I think rechargeable batteries will take care of the power thing .
53388	0	a	Yeah .
53389	0	a	Yeah .
53390	0	a	To bring the cost
53391	0	a	Yeah .
53392	0	a	Okay so we we stick to battery , one .
53393	0	a	No kinetic also .
53394	0	a	I do not I do not see the difference between kinetic and dynamo .
53395	0	a	Well maybe dynamo is like you have to actually
53396	0	a	Yeah .
53397	0	a	you have to okay
53398	0	a	I see so kinetic is really shaking the banana .
53399	0	a	Yeah .
53400	0	a	Crazy .
53401	0	a	Okay .
53402	0	a	So those banana is falling .
53403	1	a	Let is go ahead .
53404	0	a	So we we st only have one for battery .
53405	0	a	then for electronics so I did not put anything for the .
53406	0	a	So we have the regular chip on the print , which is one .
53407	0	a	Yeah .
53408	0	a	Yeah .
53409	0	a	And that is it .
53410	0	a	Okay .
53411	0	a	No
53412	0	a	so we hin
53413	0	a	Yeah so one .
53414	0	a	And we have sample speaker .
53415	0	a	Yeah .
53416	0	a	Yeah .
53417	0	a	the cost of that is very high .
53418	0	a	Ooh
53419	0	a	the cost is increasing .
53420	0	a	Well actually that that no that sample speaker is not we we are not using that , we are just using the the very beep simple beep , that s that sample thing is like the voice recording and everything .
53421	0	a	So we are
53422	0	a	The beep .
53423	0	a	Uh huh .
53424	0	a	That is what
53425	0	a	Okay
53426	1	a	so I will remove it .
53427	0	a	So
53428	0	a	Yeah .
53429	0	a	I say that
53430	0	a	Yeah .
53431	0	a	S
53432	0	a	So do not we need a
53433	0	a	Oh there is no listing for r radio frequency thing .
53434	0	a	And we have sev
53435	0	a	Yeah .
53436	0	a	So
53437	0	a	Yeah maybe .
53438	1	a	So we we will put some extras , if there is something .
53439	1	a	We will see later .
53440	0	a	Okay so in for the case I put single curved .
53441	0	a	Okay .
53442	0	a	To reduce the cost , it is okay .
53443	0	a	Well , wait a second ,
53444	0	a	no , it is it is double curved ,
53445	0	a	it is got a c , it is
53446	0	a	Well d yeah it is monotonic but it is got
53447	0	a	but if you hold it if you hold it that way that is two curved , one on this side , one on that side , but they are opposite sides .
53448	0	a	Because we have two things .
53449	0	a	Oh it is got all the directions
53450	0	a	so do not worry .
53451	0	a	No .
53452	0	a	It is got a direction .
53453	0	a	Well .
53454	0	a	What a
53455	1	a	what i if I put one here .
53456	0	a	This is actually I mean this probably
53457	0	a	this probably actually costs more than three
53458	0	a	if you
53459	0	a	Yeah .
53460	0	a	Yeah
53461	1	a	so let is put one here in the then instead of single
53462	0	a	oka all right .
53463	0	a	Okay .
53464	0	a	Okay .
53465	0	a	So we stick to plastic , it cost nothing .
53466	0	a	Yeah .
53467	0	a	That is right .
53468	0	a	Well no did not we say we wanted to do a rubber if you drop it ?
53469	0	a	Well when
53470	0	a	okay .
53471	0	a	No ,
53472	0	a	it is too
53473	0	a	no .
53474	0	a	It is too expensive .
53475	0	a	We are already at eleven .
53476	1	a	Well we we will come back
53477	1	a	we will come back and see if we can fit it in .
53478	0	a	Okay
53479	1	a	so I put rubber one .
53480	0	a	Okay so special colour , yellow .
53481	0	a	Yeah .
53482	0	a	for the interface we have We have three .
53483	0	a	We do not have any push buttons .
53484	0	a	No , we have two push buttons .
53485	0	a	No that is a scroll wheel itself , it will be put in that .
53486	0	a	Huh .
53487	0	a	No no .
53488	0	a	We have two scroll , and we have three push buttons .
53489	0	a	okay
53490	0	a	, okay .
53491	0	a	Okay , okay .
53492	0	a	Actually whe whe when you wrote regular chip you should put two , because there is another chip here .
53493	0	a	Okay it is going to have to be plastic .
53494	0	a	And
53495	0	a	No it is no chip .
53496	0	a	This is just radio frequency .
53497	0	a	Yeah .
53498	0	a	Th
53499	0	a	This is no chip .
53500	0	a	Yeah but you need
53501	0	a	Fo i it does nothing actually ?
53502	0	a	Okay so now we have a product which nobody would would buy .
53503	0	a	No .
53504	0	a	There is no chip there .
53505	0	a	It just emits the signal .
53506	0	a	It is just
53507	0	a	Yeah .
53508	0	a	And the receiver accepts it and that is it .
53509	0	a	No .
53510	0	a	Just se sends the signal , that is it .
53511	0	a	Just only .
53512	0	a	It is a recharger thing
53513	0	a	and
53514	0	a	Well I actually did think about it myself
53515	0	a	but I thought you know because you could potentially you know you could be pushing it down as you scroll it for a instead of a turbo button
53516	0	a	but you know the turbo button does add that extra class .
53517	0	a	Okay w we did not think a thought about integrated scroll wheel push buttons .
53518	0	a	Yeah ,
53519	0	a	so
53520	0	a	Yeah .
53521	0	a	You know .
53522	1	a	So I mean if we are if we are over budget then maybe we could we could rethink that .
53523	0	a	Okay .
53524	0	a	So no LCD , so for we have no button supplements ,
53525	0	a	right ?
53526	0	a	well in fact could we could not we consider this button as a button supplement
53527	0	a	because
53528	0	a	oh no ,
53529	0	a	these are these are for colours , co and special forms , special colours and special materials .
53530	0	a	Yep .
53531	0	a	No .
53532	0	a	Yeah .
53533	0	a	No we are not
53534	0	a	we do not need anything special for the buttons .
53535	0	a	So
53536	0	a	Okay so we are over budget .
53537	0	a	Yeah .
53538	1	a	So first thing which we should take care of is , instead of rubber , let it be plastic .
53539	1	a	Make it plastic instead of rubber .
53540	0	a	Yeah .
53541	0	a	And then we are basically o on budget except for you know ten cents .
53542	0	a	And that much money will be required for the base station , which is not there .
53543	0	a	Yeah .
53544	0	a	Yeah .
53545	1	a	So mayb in fact n we have to put two here
53546	0	a	because it cost nothing .
53547	0	a	Yeah well pl the base station is made out of m many units of plastic .
53548	0	a	Yeah .
53549	0	a	That is right .
53550	0	a	So might be ninety centimes for the the remaining things which the cord and everything which will go
53551	0	a	That is right .
53552	0	a	Exactly exactly
53553	0	a	so we have margin for that stuff .
53554	0	a	Does that include charging circuitry and everything ?
53555	1	a	So what do we do with the extra profits ?
53556	0	a	Okay .
53557	0	a	Yeah maybe .
53558	0	a	Okay good .
53559	0	a	Yeah .
53560	0	a	Wha
53561	0	a	Excellent .
53562	1	a	we will invest in R and D .
53563	1	a	The next fruit .
53564	0	a	Yeah .
53565	0	a	So well we are under the the the cost .
53566	1	a	So we can go to through to project evaluation .
53567	0	a	Would yeah , would buy .
53568	0	a	Sorry ?
53569	0	a	Which is different .
53570	0	a	No we have a product which none of us would buy .
53571	0	a	Yeah because th th the evaluation project
53572	0	a	would buy , yeah .
53573	0	a	Which is different .
53574	0	a	None of us will buy it .
53575	0	a	No it is people in in in Milan and in Paris that are going to buy it .
53576	0	a	Massively , yeah .
53577	0	a	We are n
53578	0	a	yeah .
53579	0	a	We are not in Milan or Paris .
53580	0	a	Yeah .
53581	0	a	Okay .
53582	0	a	you have been in Milan a couple of times , so .
53583	0	a	Actually there were a lot of
53584	0	a	That is cause I am sick of Milan .
53585	0	a	This is a battery .
53586	0	a	And you said the lowest .
53587	0	a	This is what we which you can
53588	0	a	It did yeah .
53589	0	a	S
53590	0	a	Detachable battery .
53591	0	a	Yeah , for the batteries
53592	0	a	Extra battery , yeah .
53593	0	a	Exac
53594	0	a	Well in fact I I did not know I did not know really what to say here .
53595	0	a	Okay so project process .
53596	1	a	If if you have any ideas of what we can we can say .
53597	0	a	So
53598	0	a	I do not I do not
53599	0	a	I do not understand what what they mean by satisfaction and for and for example .
53600	0	a	Should it be more like like a status of of the these meetings in fact .
53601	0	a	Yeah .
53602	0	a	Yeah well in fact we we use a little bit the white board and the digital pen , not that much .
53603	0	a	I dunno
53604	0	a	I think we had a fair bit of creativity .
53605	0	a	Oh yeah it is really creative .
53606	0	a	And but I think one thing we m missed out of this whole process was a like a focus group with the actual people we are targeting .
53607	0	a	We needed some of these kind of young trendsetters to come in and play with the banana and you know see if they see if they like it .
53608	0	a	Yeah .
53609	0	a	They like that .
53610	1	a	Yeah maybe we should go through , yeah an evaluation .
53611	0	a	Because yeah the evaluation for us is is kind of pointless .
53612	0	a	Biased .
53613	1	a	So maybe you should we should do a kind of evaluation in the streets like asking to young peoples well , do you like to have a banana as a remote control .
53614	0	a	Yeah .
53615	0	a	Because it it would also be interesting to you to know find out if we have a market in really young children as well , to see you know how to how to market this thing .
53616	0	a	Yeah .
53617	0	a	Cause you know if
53618	0	a	well I mean maybe you do not want to give all your kids their own remote because they will be changing the channel all the time
53619	0	a	but you know maybe in some households where there is you know a TV for each kid , then you know , banana remote control could be fun for them as well .
53620	1	a	Might have to draw a face on it .
53621	1	a	So but I think that is something we need to to work on next time is really finding out more about the target market .
53622	0	a	Yep .
53623	1	a	Any any new ideas we could we could investigate next time ?
53624	1	a	Dunno , oranges ?
53625	1	a	Yeah .
53626	0	a	The cost of the thing can be made more than might be .
53627	0	a	Because I think it is just the optimal , what we have done for the cost which we are looking forward to .
53628	0	a	Yeah .
53629	0	a	I think there are ways we could maybe simplify the Well just the the the circuit board that we are using inside , I am not sure really how complicated our our needs are .
53630	0	a	Interface .
53631	0	a	I mean all we have is two push buttons and two scrollers ,
53632	0	a	do we really need an integrated circuit to you know to process that .
53633	1	a	So more general remote control instead of just focusing on on TV .
53634	0	a	That is right .
53635	0	a	The complexity should not be much higher .
53636	0	a	Yeah .
53637	0	a	For
53638	0	a	you said if it good for DVD then I would
53639	1	a	And also fo you know for mood lighting and and stuff ,
53640	0	a	that would be rather cool .
53641	1	a	I think that is actually something that should be in version two , is the ability to you know to control things other than the TV and not just electronic equipment
53642	1	a	but you know the whole environment of the room .
53643	1	a	Integrate .
53644	0	a	Okay .
53645	0	a	Very good .
53646	0	a	So
53647	0	a	What else ?
53648	0	a	Okay .
53649	0	a	So
53650	0	a	Well done .
53651	1	a	I think we we can go
53652	0	a	home .
53653	0	a	Home ?
53654	0	a	Happily satisfied .
53655	0	a	Yeah .
53656	0	a	Maybe maybe we can hassle the the production department to to make a a real prototype that we can use at home to to evaluate .
53657	0	a	Yep .
53658	0	a	Okay so thanks very much .
53659	0	a	Okay .
53660	0	a	 
53661	0	a	Now what .
53662	0	a	Kay , hello everybody .
53663	0	a	, I guess you all know what is it about , you all received the email , I guess .
53664	0	a	, we are actually doing this meeting to start a new project which is about designing a remote control .
53665	0	a	So I am going to be the project manager of this project .
53666	1	a	And so I am present myself .
53667	0	a	I am Fabien Cardinaux
53668	1	a	and I I guess you can present yourself .
53669	1	a	So I dunno , you can starts .
53670	0	a	Okay ,
53671	0	a	so my name is Petre .
53672	1	a	You can call me Petre , or Peter if you like .
53673	0	a	I do not care .
53674	0	a	Okay .
53675	0	a	my name is Bob Mor .
53676	0	a	And you are ?
53677	0	a	In the project ?
53678	0	a	So , , so today we are doing a short meeting to present the project ,
53679	0	a	so We are gooding
53680	0	a	we are going to present the tool we are we are going to use during all this project .
53681	0	a	, in the project I am supposed to be the technic .
53682	0	a	Oh , sorry .
53683	0	a	Kay .
53684	0	a	So my name is Bob Morris .
53685	0	a	I am the Marketing Expert for this project .
53686	0	a	Bob ,
53687	0	a	okay .
53688	0	a	Bob yeah .
53689	0	a	My name is Hamed Getabdar , and I am going to be Interface Designer in this project .
53690	0	a	Okay .
53691	0	a	We are talking about the project plan , and we are going to to discuss about st our first ideas and so on ,
53692	0	a	and , yeah .
53693	0	a	So we have around twenty five minutes to do this meeting .
53694	0	a	So what is the goal of this project ?
53695	0	a	Is to design a new remote control .
53696	0	a	So it should be , of course , new and original , and it should be trendy , and user friendly .
53697	0	a	That mean it is a very challenging project ,
53698	0	a	and .
53699	0	a	So w it is
53700	1	a	we will try to do our best ,
53701	0	a	and hopefully come with something very new and that people want to buy .
53702	0	a	So ,
53703	0	a	So what is what are we going to do during this all this project ?
53704	0	a	So it is more like we are going to do inv individual work all in o in o our specialities
53705	0	a	and we are going to meet each other quite often to discuss and to find a good way .
53706	0	a	Yeah and everything is will be like this .
53707	0	a	so now we are going to to get used t to to the tools we are going to use all during all this project .
53708	0	a	So we can try to use the whiteboard here .
53709	0	a	So .
53710	0	a	Okay .
53711	0	a	For example we can try to write what is our our favourite animal and write the f our favourite characteristics about it .
53712	0	a	So
53713	0	a	So I will ask you all to do the same .
53714	0	a	Okay .
53715	0	a	Just to get used to the whiteboard .
53716	1	a	So probably I would try to try to draw the animal .
53717	0	a	Well sh should I draw the picture of the animal ?
53718	0	a	I I th
53719	0	a	I think I should .
53720	0	a	Yeah ,
53721	0	a	yeah , you can draw the picture , of course .
53722	0	a	Yeah go ahead .
53723	0	a	Okay , so .
53724	0	a	Okay , American , .
53725	0	a	I would use the bird .
53726	0	a	So I tried to sketch it out .
53727	0	a	I had to first write it down because I am not absolutely sure if I can draw it , but .
53728	0	a	Can you recognise it as a bird ?
53729	1	a	Okay it is your turn to
53730	0	a	Oh it is okay .
53731	0	a	Okay , okay .
53732	0	a	So I think my favourite animal would be a c a cat .
53733	0	a	Oh .
53734	0	a	That is its head .
53735	0	a	I probably like cats the most because they are cuddly and furry and playful .
53736	0	a	Okay .
53737	0	a	I dunno if I should go with this .
53738	0	a	Thanks .
53739	0	a	If it is enough line .
53740	0	a	I am sorry .
53741	1	a	Maybe put it up Put it a
53742	1	a	Maybe put it on the desk or something .
53743	0	a	Yeah .
53744	0	a	I should get used to the tool , so .
53745	0	a	Okay .
53746	1	a	Oh just wait a little bit .
53747	1	a	C could we put it here , to make it as straight as possible ?
53748	0	a	probably not .
53749	0	a	They should be remote .
53750	0	a	Okay , it it works like this .
53751	0	a	, that is better .
53752	0	a	Okay , thanks .
53753	0	a	Your lapel microphone is fallen off .
53754	0	a	Are you left handed ?
53755	0	a	Oh , pity .
53756	0	a	No .
53757	0	a	Okay .
53758	0	a	Should I clean ?
53759	0	a	Okay , I think like horses because they are strong and beautiful ,
53760	0	a	so if I want to write it here , I think I can .
53761	0	a	Never mind .
53762	0	a	Oh .
53763	1	a	, it is maybe better if you leave it .
53764	0	a	Yeah .
53765	0	a	Yeah .
53766	1	a	Maybe we should just continue .
53767	0	a	Yeah .
53768	0	a	Yeah , do not worry about it .
53769	0	a	, no worry .
53770	0	a	No .
53771	0	a	Okay .
53772	1	a	You wo not draw them , or ?
53773	1	a	Just try .
53774	1	a	You can draw it , if you want .
53775	0	a	I dunno if I can .
53776	0	a	I would like to see how it looks like .
53777	0	a	Okay .
53778	0	a	It may be like a cow or I dunno , whatever .
53779	0	a	I am not good very good in drawing .
53780	0	a	Okay , so this is very
53781	0	a	It is a bird , I think .
53782	0	a	I dunno what is it .
53783	0	a	No , I think it is clear .
53784	0	a	Four .
53785	0	a	Okay .
53786	0	a	Yeah .
53787	0	a	I am shameful
53788	0	a	Yeah .
53789	0	a	Oh that is good , it is good .
53790	0	a	It is okay .
53791	0	a	It is in it is indeed beautiful .
53792	0	a	Good .
53793	0	a	Yeah , and strong .
53794	0	a	Okay .
53795	0	a	Okay .
53796	0	a	Bob .
53797	0	a	Have to remember it .
53798	0	a	Bob .
53799	0	a	So good
53800	1	a	So , let is talk about money .
53801	0	a	we are going to to sell we want to sell this remote control for twenty five Euro Euro .
53802	0	a	And our expected profit will be around fifty million Euro .
53803	0	a	And we are trying to to have a market all around the world .
53804	0	a	So n not only for Switzerland , but for the world .
53805	0	a	So , .
53806	0	a	The
53807	0	a	We expect a production cost of maximum twelve point fifty Euro .
53808	0	a	Per unit , I guess .
53809	0	a	Yeah , of course .
53810	0	a	Y
53811	0	a	oh okay .
53812	1	a	, so we can start today to have a first idea of what we want to do what are our experiments with remote control , and any idea ?
53813	1	a	So , if you have some experience , good or bad , with remote controls you can share it and say what you f what is your idea .
53814	0	a	Anything .
53815	0	a	Okay .
53816	0	a	Well , from experience , I have had remote controls in the past that have had very they have had lots and lots of buttons and they have been very small , and it is been very hard to to to use , because there is so many buttons , and you know it is very hard to see which buttons do what , and the buttons are very small and very hard to press .
53817	0	a	and and normally you only every use ,
53818	0	a	you know , on a TV remote you only ever use , mostly , you know , f four or f six buttons .
53819	0	a	Oh .
53820	0	a	So it is frustrated me in the past , th that .
53821	1	a	Okay , I have also some points .
53822	0	a	Maybe two points .
53823	0	a	first would be that in current remote controls there is no back light ,
53824	1	a	so if you are if you are playing with this in the dark room it is it is probably worth to to have something like back light .
53825	0	a	Yeah .
53826	1	a	And maybe it could be also dependant on the the amount of of light in the room , so that if if it is in the day it does not need to be back lighted because it works on the battery , so .
53827	1	a	So something like this .
53828	0	a	And the second thing , f second point from me would be that in a normal remote control there is there are two buttons for volume control .
53829	1	a	But I prefer like a potential meter or something like .
53830	0	a	Yeah .
53831	0	a	, okay .
53832	0	a	Okay .
53833	1	a	You know , some slider or
53834	0	a	Not just two discrete buttons for volume ,
53835	0	a	but something which
53836	0	a	Yeah ,
53837	0	a	but I can reach
53838	0	a	In one second I can mute it down , or or make a high volume .
53839	0	a	Okay .
53840	0	a	Okay , n
53841	0	a	Is that because the of the discrete volume levels ,
53842	0	a	or is that
53843	0	a	Yeah .
53844	0	a	Yeah .
53845	0	a	Are you not afraid that if you take your remote control you can move the slide and it could the the volume can go up very quickly
53846	0	a	and it can
53847	0	a	Yeah , also if y when you take the the remote control , for example on the table , you take it and you push the button and everything is very loud , and you have a heart attack .
53848	0	a	, n .
53849	0	a	If it drops to the floor then it starts to scream .
53850	0	a	Yeah , f It depends what what you feel about that .
53851	0	a	Okay .
53852	0	a	Yeah .
53853	1	a	Yeah but we can we can think of these things afterwards ,
53854	0	a	but if you have some more notes on that .
53855	0	a	Yeah
53856	0	a	so you can
53857	1	a	Do you have something ?
53858	0	a	Yeah , that is true .
53859	1	a	I
53860	1	a	Yeah ,
53861	0	a	just a simple experience .
53862	0	a	I I prefer remote control working with radio waves ,
53863	0	a	because remote control working with infra red rays you should you should you should keep it in a specific direction and then try it hard to tune .
53864	0	a	Yeah without obstacles and .
53865	0	a	Okay .
53866	1	a	Okay .
53867	1	a	Let is continue .
53868	0	a	I have a meeting in five minutes ,
53869	1	a	so maybe we should hurry .
53870	0	a	Okay .
53871	0	a	Okay ,
53872	0	a	just a second .
53873	1	a	So we will close this meeting .
53874	0	a	So we will have a next meeting in thirty minutes .
53875	0	a	The
53876	0	a	So I will ask you to do some work .
53877	0	a	the the interface interface developer will work on the on the design of the remote control , start to to have new idea and read about
53878	0	a	Which i which is Hamed , ?
53879	0	a	Okay .
53880	0	a	He is the Industrial Designer ?
53881	0	a	No , you are the Industrial Designer .
53882	0	a	Yeah .
53883	0	a	I am the Technical Designer , I dunno which one , v .
53884	0	a	Oh .
53885	0	a	Yeah ,
53886	0	a	I think that is the first .
53887	0	a	Industry and Oh .
53888	0	a	Uh huh .
53889	0	a	ID .
53890	0	a	Industrial Designer .
53891	0	a	And the second one is the User Interface Designer .
53892	0	a	User Interf
53893	0	a	Okay .
53894	0	a	And then last one is marketing , which is me .
53895	0	a	Yeah .
53896	0	a	Okay , so I am the first one .
53897	0	a	So ,
53898	0	a	For the User Interface Designer , which is Hamed , , you are going to work on the technical functions of the remote control .
53899	0	a	I see .
53900	0	a	Okay .
53901	0	a	And for the Marketing Manager , I dunno , okay , which is Bob
53902	0	a	, you are going to try to to find the user requirements f for the remote control .
53903	0	a	, you will receive by email the specific instructions and by your personal coach .
53904	0	a	Sign .
53905	0	a	Yep finished .
53906	0	a	So I see you in thirty minutes .
53907	0	a	Great , okay .
53908	0	a	Okay .
53909	0	a	Okay , thanks .
53910	0	a	Thanks guys .
53911	0	a	 
53912	0	a	So nice to see you again .
53913	0	a	So , .
53914	0	a	Tod for this meeting I will take the notes and do the minutes .
53915	0	a	so we will see our three presentations .
53916	0	a	we will start with the Manager Expert wi who will talk about user re requirements , whats user needs and what it desire for this devi device .
53917	0	a	Okay ,
53918	0	a	can I have the laptop over here , or ?
53919	0	a	Okay
53920	0	a	Yep .
53921	0	a	Oh , I do not think so .
53922	0	a	I think you have to come here .
53923	0	a	Have to get up .
53924	0	a	I dunno .
53925	0	a	I think it should stay .
53926	0	a	Excuse me .
53927	0	a	Yeah , that is it .
53928	0	a	Okay .
53929	0	a	Should stay in the square here .
53930	0	a	Okay .
53931	0	a	Oh , maybe .
53932	0	a	Okay , so basically I am going to present some findings of a study we conducted into what users want in this remote control .
53933	1	a	Oh , you can put it here .
53934	0	a	Oh that is okay , it is jus
53935	0	a	so first of all we what we did is we conducted a an experiment with a hundred test subjects .
53936	0	a	we put them in a in our usability laboratory and got them to , you know , play with remote controls , and also to complete , after they would done that , to complete a questionnaire to tell us what they like and what they do not like in remote controls .
53937	0	a	So basically the major things we found out was that basically users do not like the look and feel of of most remote controls that are currently on the market .
53938	0	a	they , you know ,
53939	0	a	seventy five percent of the people
53940	0	a	we we did the experiments on , found that rem remote the remote controls that they would used in the past
53941	0	a	were ugly .
53942	0	a	Completely ugly .
53943	0	a	they they did not match the operating behaviour of the user , that is , you know , the the way users use remote controls when they are watching TV .
53944	0	a	, that the layout of the remote controls did not match they way that they used it .
53945	0	a	and thirdly they say that w half of the users that we tested said that they only used ten percent of the buttons that are on remote controls .
53946	0	a	so we collect
53947	0	a	we also some collected some usage statistics based on how these test subjects were using their remote control .
53948	0	a	And from this we basically came up with the figure that the channel buttons , the channel selection buttons are the most by far the most used buttons on the remote control .
53949	0	a	and you can see they are used a hundred and sixty eight times per hour on average , , while the user is watching TV .
53950	0	a	the closest button that was used ,
53951	0	a	well the cl
53952	0	a	the button that was used that was closest to the channel button was the teletext button , which was used fourteen times per hour , followed by the volume button , which was four times per hour , , all the other , all the other buttons , such as ch audio and picture selection configuration buttons and things were used , you know ,
53953	0	a	l approx well less than or equal to one times per hour .
53954	0	a	we also asked users which buttons had the most importance to them , you know , which which buttons they felt were the most important buttons on on the remote control .
53955	0	a	And basically they came they said the channel , volume , and power buttons had the highest relevance to users , note that only power was very infrequently used
53956	0	a	, it only had a b a a fr usage frequency of about one times per hour , but users ranked it as having a very very high relevance .
53957	0	a	and the audio and picture settings had a very
53958	0	a	that well the users thought that w the audio and picture settings were very were not very important to them , and they used them very infrequently a as well .
53959	0	a	So we asked users what what frustrates them the most about current remote controls .
53960	0	a	And fifty percent of the users said that what frustrates them is losing the remote control somewhere in the room and not being able to find it .
53961	0	a	they also said that it it takes a lot of time to learn a new remote control , especially when there is many buttons and it is a , you know , a c a a unintuitive interface .
53962	0	a	and then thirdly , they some users commented on the fact that the the you know the way that you have to hold and press buttons on a remote control ar are bad and cause u repetitive strain injury .
53963	0	a	We also asked some users about some specific features that they would like to see in the on the remote control .
53964	0	a	In particular , do they want an LCD d display , and secondly , do they think speech recognition is a useful feature to have on a remote control .
53965	0	a	basically our findings are that amongst a younger age groups the answer is umv overwhelmingly yes .
53966	0	a	They want these features , they want these high technology features .
53967	0	a	for instance , ninety one percent of pe of people aged between fifteen and twenty five said yes , they want these features .
53968	0	a	Whereas the the trend was as users as users became older and older they were less likely to want these sort of features in a in a remote control .
53969	0	a	So I guess it depends on where we are focusing our our market .
53970	0	a	and as our company motto is putting fashion in electronics , I think we are focusing on the younger younger target demographic ,
53971	1	a	and so maybe we should think about adding these sort of high technology features into our remote control .
53972	0	a	That is my dic that is my presentation .
53973	0	a	Thank you .
53974	0	a	Thank you .
53975	0	a	Okay .
53976	0	a	So ,
53977	1	a	maybe now we can talk about a user interface and about the technical function of this device .
53978	1	a	So Pet Peter , can you talk say something about that ?
53979	0	a	No .
53980	1	a	Well , okay
53981	1	a	, yeah .
53982	0	a	Yeah , but the user user interface is responsible .
53983	0	a	B you think
53984	0	a	I I am User Interface Manager .
53985	0	a	Okay , so .
53986	0	a	Sorry , I am Sorry .
53987	0	a	Okay .
53988	0	a	Sorry .
53989	0	a	Okay .
53990	0	a	If I could go there with this cable .
53991	0	a	You are scaring me with LCD man .
53992	0	a	And speech recognition in remote unit , it will be very e expensive .
53993	0	a	Yeah , it is true ,
53994	0	a	but , you know , they are features that users want ,
53995	0	a	so it is
53996	0	a	And our production cost of twelve fifty Euros per per unit is fairly high I think ,
53997	0	a	so I think we can afford to to add these sort of features into our remote .
53998	0	a	Yeah .
53999	0	a	Yeah .
54000	0	a	At least we have couple of months t to work on it
54001	0	a	so so it will be cheaper finally .
54002	0	a	Sh okay .
54003	0	a	It is true .
54004	0	a	Where is delete button ?
54005	0	a	Okay .
54006	0	a	Oh I am sorry .
54007	0	a	Okay .
54008	0	a	That is the wrong one , I think .
54009	0	a	Yeah ,
54010	0	a	it is still Bob Morris .
54011	0	a	Oh .
54012	0	a	Presentation three ?
54013	0	a	Oh .
54014	0	a	Because you cancelled it .
54015	0	a	Yeah you should have put yes .
54016	0	a	Yeah .
54017	1	a	Click on yes .
54018	0	a	yeah .
54019	0	a	Yep .
54020	0	a	Okay , so here is my presentation about technical function design .
54021	1	a	I will talk about different components and s of system and how they react together .
54022	0	a	Okay , , first what is a remote control ?
54023	0	a	Simply it is a device , as you know , for , for sending some commands by some waves to another device to to tell different commands with this device .
54024	0	a	And the main idea we do not use any cable and we can rec react simpler with the device .
54025	0	a	i it has different blocks , different blocks .
54026	0	a	first is remote control have sh ha should have some electric circuits making interface with keyboard and r reading keyboard and reading the keyboard commands .
54027	0	a	And then inter then make these keyboard commands , in interpret these int keyboard commands .
54028	0	a	And then there should be an electronic circuit making electronic signals according to these commands and finally there is a transmitter which is a cord or a a diode making making waves to transmit through the air and this air this wave will be received by the by the other device like a television or whatever , to r to realise the command .
54029	0	a	Okay , about what I found about different these different blocks are , usually there are two different methods to for designing a remote control .
54030	0	a	They are based on infra red waves or radio waves .
54031	0	a	You still want me the presentation .
54032	0	a	There are two different solutions I mean .
54033	0	a	This is this can be the the differences the th between different kind of waves , infra red or radio waves .
54034	0	a	And also as I understood , and I think it was a part of Bob , presentation , people prefer to have to have the remote control with less button .
54035	1	a	So for the electronic part , working and interfacing , with button , we should we should try to t try to design a remote control having some some simpler buttons or some rolling buttons to just to just to search between different options , and showing o something on TV and putting less lesser stuff on the on the remote control .
54036	0	a	And personal preferences ,
54037	1	a	certainly a remote control with working with radio waves is preferred because you can pr you can take it in any direction
54038	1	a	and you do not need to tune it any way .
54039	1	a	And again , using bigger buttons and less number of buttons are also preferred , as I see .
54040	0	a	Okay .
54041	0	a	That was my presentation .
54042	0	a	Okay .
54043	1	a	I have a question .
54044	0	a	Uh huh .
54045	0	a	Do you think radio waves will interfere with other appliances in the home ?
54046	0	a	Okay .
54047	0	a	, I do not think so , because we can make we ca we can make this wave in a specific frequency .
54048	0	a	So they can be in a range which is not inter interfering with the with other devices inside the home .
54049	0	a	So can we use any any frequency ?
54050	0	a	We have the right to use any frequency ?
54051	0	a	Okay .
54052	0	a	Yeah , it should be okay .
54053	0	a	no
54054	0	a	but as I know , there is a range for for this f for for for this stuff , for designing this circuit .
54055	1	a	We can we can we can tune our transmitter to work in this range ,
54056	0	a	and for this range we do not need to ask any permission .
54057	0	a	And what happen with radio waves when two neighbours have the same have our remote control , for example ?
54058	0	a	And so do they have the same frequency , or ?
54059	0	a	Okay .
54060	0	a	for this I am not I
54061	0	a	I do not know the solution ,
54062	1	a	but one solution can be something like putting p password or something inside the wave , so the only your TV can understand it
54063	0	a	Yeah , identification code inside the The password may simply or i identification code may simply solve this problem .
54064	0	a	A kind of identification , okay .
54065	0	a	Yeah f I know about this , since it is my it is exactly my field , so .
54066	0	a	So
54067	0	a	Yeah .
54068	0	a	It is kind of handshaking , , when starting to when you start to communicate with the your TV then then it is like an handshaking protocol with your your remote .
54069	0	a	So
54070	0	a	Okay .
54071	0	a	So so if two two devices are trying to go to communicate with the TV set then the the the one which has the more energy in the wave is chosen .
54072	0	a	Well it can be a problem sometimes , but most of the time it works okay .
54073	0	a	A specific remote control has a specific f
54074	0	a	Yeah
54075	0	a	but we we do not have to think about this
54076	0	a	because I think as a function designer that we will use the already made circuits which we probably bu buy .
54077	0	a	It is worth to buy .
54078	0	a	And they have these problems solved so .
54079	0	a	Okay .
54080	0	a	So we do not have to think about these .
54081	0	a	Okay .
54082	0	a	Okay .
54083	1	a	So , maybe you can talk about the function , and
54084	0	a	Open .
54085	0	a	Yes .
54086	0	a	I have only a couple of things because I had I struggled a bit with the software that I am supposed to use in this in this company .
54087	0	a	I was used to use Linux before , so .
54088	0	a	But I tried to tried to break through this too , I guess .
54089	0	a	Okay .
54090	0	a	How to make it big ?
54091	0	a	Slide show .
54092	0	a	Slide show .
54093	0	a	Five .
54094	0	a	Okay ,
54095	0	a	thanks .
54096	0	a	It should work ,
54097	0	a	so you can .
54098	0	a	Okay .
54099	1	a	Oh so I will speak about working design .
54100	0	a	That is the first slide .
54101	0	a	what I have to do ?
54102	0	a	A look at what the other company
54103	0	a	Okay so presently I am looking what is possible to use , what circuits to use and stuff like that because I did not work with these circuits so far
54104	0	a	so I have to look what what is a v a v available on the market for for the communication for the IR circuits and so on , so I am currently looking what is available on the web .
54105	0	a	And I wanted to ask you m maybe afterwards , after after our discussion , if we have some contacts in some companies , so , which can report on what is going on there ,
54106	0	a	so , I would be glad if you can tell me about them .
54107	0	a	Yeah .
54108	0	a	So , you know .
54109	0	a	, okay findings , that is the point that I am working on currently
54110	0	a	but
54111	0	a	so far I
54112	0	a	I was looking what what are the blue circuit , I mean radio wave radio frequency circuits are available now , but the prices I read are high .
54113	0	a	So , I know that the user interface people and these speak about radio frequency waves because you can you can you can make the TV do what you want even if you are in the bathroom or so on , but you know , when you are not close to the TV you probably wo not need to to change the program and so on
54114	1	a	and so I am I am voting for s to stick to the infra red control instead of RW
54115	1	a	but we will discuss it later maybe .
54116	0	a	Components to use , I am not exactly sure what I will use for the design of the circuit .
54117	0	a	It depends on whether we will use the LCD and mainly the speech recognition ,
54118	0	a	because the speech rec
54119	0	a	Yeah ?
54120	0	a	No no no
54121	0	a	no no .
54122	0	a	Are we are we planning to take an off the shelf an OEM component for the radio wave circuit , or are we planning to construct our own circuit board ?
54123	0	a	Okay s
54124	0	a	So we just buy a circuit board and
54125	0	a	Okay .
54126	0	a	This we this we buy
54127	0	a	I think , because it is rather cheap nowadays
54128	0	a	and it is not worth to construct ourselves .
54129	0	a	Exactly .
54130	0	a	But I am not sure about the circuit which is responsible for speech recognition .
54131	1	a	This I prefer that we should make ourselves .
54132	0	a	Okay .
54133	0	a	But it depends whether we take a decision to use it .
54134	0	a	Same thing .
54135	0	a	It is fairly expensive to use these circuits .
54136	0	a	So , speech recognition
54137	0	a	well , LCD it is okay because it is common nowadays to use LCD ,
54138	0	a	so I agree on using any kind of LCD , less buttons good for me as a as a designer of the circuit .
54139	0	a	Yeah .
54140	1	a	But the speech recognition we have to compare whether the price and the what does it offer , you know .
54141	0	a	Yeah .
54142	0	a	So what do you think would be the price , it would be out of range ?
54143	0	a	Or it would be maybe feasible ?
54144	0	a	Okay .
54145	0	a	Yeah , I am
54146	0	a	Oh .
54147	0	a	I was not thinking too much about the price .
54148	0	a	But if we use the LCD even the radio frequency communication with the TV set and the backlight and related things like the photo diodes and stuff , it should be okay .
54149	0	a	If we decide to use the speech recognition , then we probably could struggle
54150	1	a	but we will see afterwards .
54151	0	a	It depends of you if if the ME or UID ,
54152	0	a	I am sorry about the names ,
54153	0	a	I do not really know , want to have it like in metal or in plastic , these things ,
54154	0	a	it it depends on you not
54155	0	a	Because the the the electronic device is price is not not so big in comparison to to the overall shape and stuff like that , so .
54156	0	a	Okay .
54157	1	a	We will discuss it afterwards .
54158	0	a	Oh , this is nothing .
54159	0	a	This is just my notes on what to use .
54160	0	a	And my personal preference is yes , I would like also preferably to use RW circuit ,
54161	1	a	but from the point of view of the design and price , I would stick to IRs .
54162	0	a	That is my opinion .
54163	0	a	I mean if infra red circuit not not the radio frequency .
54164	0	a	Why ?
54165	0	a	Because it is simpler ?
54166	0	a	Yeah .
54167	0	a	Because because the the range where you can use it is fair .
54168	0	a	It is okay I think .
54169	0	a	And the price is fairly cheap for this .
54170	0	a	Okay .
54171	0	a	It is a a price matter .
54172	0	a	Well , depends .
54173	0	a	Yeah .
54174	0	a	Jus just the price .
54175	0	a	Otherwise I do not care what I put there because it is the chip which I buy or which we buy .
54176	0	a	Okay .
54177	0	a	So I I
54178	0	a	I think it is o
54179	0	a	y o .
54180	0	a	What how much more expensive ?
54181	0	a	Are we talking three times more expensive ?
54182	0	a	Or ten times more expensive ?
54183	0	a	Or
54184	0	a	Okay .
54185	0	a	Well , three to three to five .
54186	0	a	N not ten times ,
54187	0	a	but it depends what what we
54188	0	a	Yeah .
54189	0	a	Yeah yeah .
54190	0	a	That is still a lot .
54191	0	a	I think it is it is probably not worth spending the extra money ,
54192	0	a	because I mean all the other remote controls on the market have infra red , so people do not expect anything other than infra red .
54193	0	a	Yeah .
54194	0	a	Yeah .
54195	0	a	So it is not worth spending the extra money .
54196	0	a	Well I , oh
54197	0	a	On the other side , we want to have something new .
54198	0	a	Th they are used to use it when they can see the TV
54199	0	a	so , I do not know .
54200	0	a	Yeah .
54201	0	a	You know ,
54202	0	a	where we want to to have something new
54203	0	a	and So we I think we should still thinking about it .
54204	0	a	Yeah .
54205	0	a	But maybe .
54206	0	a	But I think , based on my usability studies
54207	0	a	I th
54208	0	a	I feel that users are prioritise the look and the feel and the trendiness above , you know , the difference between infra red or radio waves .
54209	0	a	Okay .
54210	0	a	So I think we are better off spending money in the usability phase .
54211	0	a	You the user interface , and management man ,
54212	0	a	okay , that is it for me .
54213	0	a	Okay .
54214	0	a	Yeah .
54215	0	a	Okay .
54216	0	a	Okay , thank you Peter .
54217	0	a	Kay .
54218	0	a	So I have to inform you
54219	0	a	I receive an email from the management bon board today and they have new requirements for the for the remote control .
54220	0	a	first , they say that is about something about t teletext .
54221	0	a	apparently it becomes from according to them it becomes out of date .
54222	0	a	Out dated .
54223	0	a	And
54224	0	a	Because of the internet popularity and everybody has internet at home , and actually it is not useful to have teletext .
54225	0	a	So I think we can avoid the teletext .
54226	0	a	the second thing is they suggest that that we should use the remote control only for TV , not for DVD and other devices , because it make it it makes it is too complex and because we have not much time for this project we should stay on TV on the only specific TV remote control .
54227	0	a	I agree .
54228	0	a	The third
54229	0	a	the third one is about the the the image of the company .
54230	0	a	So we should we should keep The the product should be recognisable .
54231	0	a	It is That mean we should use the colour of our company and maybe put somewhere the s the slogan of the company , which is , we put fashion of in electronics .
54232	0	a	So , when people see the the remote control , they should say oh it is from Real Reaction
54233	0	a	and he s they should recognise the company .
54234	0	a	So ,
54235	1	a	So now we we should take the decision what we are going to what function we will have on this on this remote control .
54236	0	a	So , , are we going to use LCD , speech recognition ?
54237	1	a	Well , should we start with just the core , the basic functions that we need .
54238	1	a	And then we can move on to the more advanced features .
54239	0	a	Yeah .
54240	0	a	Yes .
54241	0	a	Maybe , maybe .
54242	0	a	Okay , so the available things are LCD , the buttons and everything .
54243	0	a	radio frequency depends .
54244	0	a	And , well the recognition it depends on you guys .
54245	0	a	Yeah
54246	0	a	but first maybe what is what are the usual function of a standard remote control ?
54247	0	a	I mean
54248	0	a	what do
54249	0	a	Yeah .
54250	0	a	You should probably speak .
54251	0	a	Okay .
54252	0	a	Okay , well , I mean the obvious one is changing channels .
54253	0	a	Yeah .
54254	0	a	Yeah .
54255	1	a	I think we should stick on very useful functions , because we want less button .
54256	0	a	Yeah .
54257	0	a	So , yeah .
54258	0	a	Yeah , okay .
54259	1	a	So , turning channel , of course .
54260	1	a	Volume setting .
54261	1	a	just one note to the chan channel changing .
54262	0	a	Do we
54263	0	a	will we use only two buttons , or or like numbered buttons ?
54264	0	a	I mean those nine plus one or two ?
54265	0	a	Because it is many buttons and we were speaking about lowering the number .
54266	0	a	Yeah .
54267	0	a	I think it would be a b
54268	0	a	Yeah .
54269	0	a	Yeah ,
54270	0	a	I
54271	0	a	yeah .
54272	0	a	On the other side we have more and more channels , and if you want to pass through all the channels to get the channel you want , it is
54273	1	a	Maybe maybe we could think of something more betweens , like
54274	0	a	Yeah .
54275	0	a	Yeah .
54276	0	a	Okay
54277	1	a	so so we keep all these all these buttons .
54278	0	a	Yeah yeah , at least nine , ten button .
54279	1	a	Like ten plus , five plus , one plus , one minus or something .
54280	0	a	Maybe something like that .
54281	1	a	Or using the names and the keyboard
54282	0	a	I dunno .
54283	0	a	Or Or something .
54284	0	a	Maybe Oh I do not know .
54285	0	a	Oh .
54286	1	a	Maybe we could have key buttons , like discovery channe like documentary channel , and movies channel and
54287	1	a	And inside this this thing you can move , maybe switch .
54288	0	a	You mean like hierarchical structure .
54289	0	a	Okay .
54290	0	a	Like categorising channels .
54291	1	a	If you want to see a movie you click on the movie button so you have all the movie channels and after you have you plus plus plus .
54292	0	a	Okay , so s
54293	0	a	Oh sorry .
54294	0	a	Okay .
54295	0	a	I
54296	0	a	It just an idea .
54297	0	a	I do not know what you think about that
54298	0	a	but .
54299	0	a	So it requires the use of LCD probably , to to tell you
54300	0	a	Okay ,
54301	1	a	so I will make a note on LCD .
54302	0	a	To have some feedback .
54303	0	a	Yeah , probably , yeah ,
54304	0	a	yeah .
54305	0	a	Yeah .
54306	1	a	We could maybe also c incorporate Petre is idea of the slider for the volume , with the channel .
54307	0	a	Okay .
54308	0	a	Okay .
54309	0	a	So we c
54310	0	a	you could quickly just through many channels .
54311	0	a	Yeah .
54312	0	a	Like roller for the Yeah .
54313	0	a	For the channels , perhaps .
54314	0	a	Okay .
54315	1	a	Anything else ?
54316	0	a	Yeah .
54317	0	a	So we have got channel and volume .
54318	0	a	So we are still s speaking about the common devices or we are inviting the new one ?
54319	0	a	On the screen , you mean ?
54320	0	a	Not on the control , but on the screen .
54321	0	a	I think so .
54322	0	a	I think basically the core functions we want , and then more advanced ones .
54323	0	a	Yeah .
54324	1	a	What about the settings of the TV ?
54325	0	a	Because it is button we do not use very often , but it is we need it anyway .
54326	0	a	So we do not have any we do not have
54327	0	a	we should just design the remote control and
54328	0	a	we sh
54329	0	a	we do not have any access to the to the TV design or we can change some design .
54330	0	a	So
54331	0	a	Yeah ,
54332	0	a	yeah .
54333	0	a	Yeah .
54334	0	a	Because one solution for this ch changing channels is to see a summary of all channels , some some preview of all channels
54335	0	a	and then you can
54336	0	a	Yeah .
54337	0	a	Yeah b Not on the control , on the screen , on the TV screen .
54338	0	a	Well , this would avoid LCD , then .
54339	0	a	I do not
54340	0	a	Oh , I do not
54341	0	a	but I do not think we are
54342	0	a	we are the ones .
54343	0	a	And then
54344	0	a	I mean this remote control we are developing is a generic control for all TVs , I think .
54345	0	a	I do not know if it is possible to to watch something on TV
54346	0	a	Yeah .
54347	0	a	Oh .
54348	0	a	W
54349	0	a	I
54350	0	a	I think it it would be better to to stick to the remote control and not to bother the TV to to to print these things .
54351	0	a	Yeah .
54352	0	a	Well it wi it will be still more expensive , but for the LCD and this stuff is no problem in the price .
54353	0	a	Okay .
54354	1	a	So , what are we doing with the settings ?
54355	0	a	Because settings
54356	0	a	if we want to do settings we need buttons for that
54357	0	a	and we want less buttons , so .
54358	1	a	Maybe with the LCD we can do something with less buttons , but
54359	0	a	Yeah .
54360	0	a	But then you do not want to make the LCD display too complicated at the same time .
54361	1	a	I mean there is always we can always have these l less often used functions hidden somewhere , under a cover or at the back of under a slide or some
54362	0	a	Yeah .
54363	0	a	Two TVs .
54364	0	a	Yeah .
54365	0	a	Oh yeah .
54366	0	a	Like ma
54367	1	a	We we could have for example two buttons like simple mode and advanced mode .
54368	0	a	Oh , the .
54369	0	a	Or I dunno .
54370	1	a	Or like children and grandfather is mode , and the , well the the user
54371	0	a	not the user ,
54372	1	a	the man mana TV manager mode .
54373	0	a	Yeah .
54374	0	a	Okay .
54375	0	a	, I dunno .
54376	0	a	So we have five minutes left .
54377	0	a	Yeah .
54378	0	a	So I think s the settings we th we are agreeing are agreed that they are required .
54379	0	a	Yeah .
54380	0	a	It is just how to a
54381	0	a	Yeah .
54382	0	a	Yeah .
54383	1	a	We should hide them somewhere .
54384	0	a	Hide them , okay .
54385	1	a	In the menus of the LCD or in the back of the remote control , or something like that .
54386	0	a	Okay .
54387	0	a	Yeah .
54388	1	a	, okay , what else ?
54389	0	a	I mean a power button is obviously required .
54390	0	a	Yes .
54391	0	a	This I was thinking .
54392	0	a	Do we need a power button at all ?
54393	1	a	Should should should not we do it like sleep mode after five minutes of not using it ?
54394	0	a	Because generally
54395	0	a	Yes .
54396	0	a	It is it is a kind of setting , I think .
54397	1	a	It should fit in those settings functions .
54398	0	a	Settings .
54399	0	a	Because it is not a very current useful function .
54400	0	a	, well I think when they say power button they mean to turn the TV on and off .
54401	0	a	No , I think it is after after five minutes or something a timer
54402	0	a	I I think , no ?
54403	0	a	Oh okay , yeah .
54404	0	a	Well I
54405	0	a	I
54406	0	a	You do not need to every five minutes to keep it alive .
54407	0	a	But if you are watching TV for two hours , you do not want your TV to turn off after five five minute
54408	0	a	I mean based on our usability studies again , pe people said that the power button was v a very relevant button .
54409	0	a	probably .
54410	0	a	Okay , so we should keep this button .
54411	0	a	Yeah .
54412	0	a	, you know , it was nine out of ten re relevance .
54413	0	a	Okay ,
54414	1	a	so we we could p
54415	1	a	what we could probably do is to keep also to keep keep the LCD and all the buttons and stuff , we could make it like a opening opening style that if you open it you are you just turn on the TV and if you close it , it will turn off the TV .
54416	0	a	Yeah .
54417	0	a	Yeah .
54418	0	a	If if you like this ,
54419	1	a	Because , well it is maybe question for you t
54420	0	a	Yeah .
54421	0	a	Okay .
54422	0	a	B
54423	0	a	Okay .
54424	1	a	I think we need to concentrate on the , you know , the major usage of the th of the control ,
54425	0	a	which is you sit down , you turn on your TV , you change channels , you change the volume , you turn the TV off .
54426	0	a	Yeah .
54427	0	a	Yeah .
54428	0	a	and all the other f functionality is not used very often .
54429	0	a	So s yeah .
54430	0	a	Yeah
54431	1	a	, they can
54432	1	a	yeah
54433	1	a	they can be hide somewhere by a cover or something like this .
54434	0	a	Yeah .
54435	0	a	Yeah .
54436	1	a	Like covering cu .
54437	1	a	On the back , or
54438	0	a	For what ?
54439	0	a	oh yeah ,
54440	0	a	yeah .
54441	0	a	I mean like the
54442	0	a	Yeah but since we have the LCD , we did not need too much button too many buttons .
54443	1	a	Yeah , like mobile phone covering .
54444	0	a	, okay , just the decision of the power button .
54445	0	a	Should we make it a button , or some some something which would be
54446	0	a	power button .
54447	0	a	I think a button .
54448	0	a	A button is better .
54449	0	a	I think it should be a bu
54450	1	a	Its own button on the front .
54451	0	a	If it if it is a button or
54452	0	a	Okay .
54453	0	a	Yeah .
54454	0	a	Yeah a button ,
54455	0	a	yeah
54456	0	a	I guess so .
54457	0	a	Okay , one nice big button .
54458	0	a	Old fashioned button , to satisfy the grandmothers .
54459	0	a	Okay .
54460	1	a	So , any other suggestions or functions ?
54461	0	a	Yeah , we have still one or two minutes to talk , yeah .
54462	0	a	S
54463	0	a	What about things like the clock and timers ?
54464	0	a	, you know , some func some features on the control to display a time , or t to display
54465	0	a	Probably not .
54466	0	a	Do we still have the time ?
54467	0	a	I I just wonder .
54468	0	a	Okay .
54469	0	a	Oh .
54470	0	a	Well what w what was the question ?
54471	0	a	Yeah but since we want to control all the televisions , and and it would probably be worth to to set the timing on the remote ,
54472	0	a	no ?
54473	0	a	Because if if the TV turns on itself , it well you know , if the time The timer should be there .
54474	0	a	Clock or
54475	0	a	Yes .
54476	0	a	Usually it is already on TV or something like that .
54477	0	a	Yeah .
54478	0	a	Yeah .
54479	0	a	Yeah .
54480	0	a	If we if we add the time , we have to have maybe a bigger display or something like that ,
54481	0	a	and is it very useful ?
54482	0	a	I mean , are users wants to have the time on the on the remote ?
54483	0	a	This is the question .
54484	0	a	Is it useful ?
54485	0	a	W
54486	0	a	In my opinion we should have only useful thing
54487	0	a	and Because apparently they want The simpler it is is better .
54488	0	a	Yes .
54489	0	a	It is a questi yeah , it is a trade off .
54490	0	a	Kay .
54491	0	a	, yeah .
54492	0	a	Okay simple .
54493	0	a	Did you did you ever use the like the timing of turning on the TV ,
54494	0	a	well And based on your
54495	0	a	Yeah
54496	0	a	but it can be on the display in in a corner all the time on the remote .
54497	0	a	Very ,
54498	0	a	yeah
54499	0	a	okay , very occasionally .
54500	0	a	But I do use the
54501	0	a	I do use the display of the time quite often , but
54502	0	a	Yeah .
54503	0	a	Yeah that is okay , that is true .
54504	0	a	Okay , so no time button .
54505	0	a	No time on .
54506	0	a	And do we need to include anything about the speech recognition and the speech commands , or ?
54507	0	a	I
54508	0	a	I thin
54509	0	a	I think it will not take lots of place , we just need a microphone and the software ,
54510	0	a	so , and it sh and it will be a little bit new and interesting , so people may be attracted to buy this stuff
54511	0	a	and it is not very difficult to put a software inside the the electronic device and put a microphone .
54512	0	a	Okay .
54513	0	a	Yes yes .
54514	0	a	I think
54515	0	a	Yeah .
54516	0	a	It does not take that much place and also that much It does not cost that much .
54517	0	a	Yeah
54518	0	a	but we we should be careful about the battery life , then .
54519	0	a	If we use the speech recognition .
54520	1	a	So maybe we think we can think more about that , and discuss that maybe last time next time .
54521	0	a	And yeah , now the meeting room is busy .
54522	0	a	Somebody booked the meeting room just for at one PM , and so we should leave .
54523	0	a	So , .
54524	0	a	So now we are going for for a small lunch .
54525	0	a	It is funded by the company .
54526	0	a	And after we have thirteen minutes to to do indevel individual works .
54527	0	a	And I will do the minutes .
54528	0	a	And you are going to work on your individual works .
54529	0	a	And you will receive as usual your specific instruction and so on .
54530	0	a	Okay ,
54531	0	a	cool .
54532	0	a	Okay
54533	0	a	 
54534	0	a	Hello ,
54535	0	a	this meeting we are
54536	0	a	it is fo
54537	0	a	should be focused on the conceptual design of the remote control .
54538	0	a	Hello .
54539	0	a	Hello .
54540	0	a	the goal of this meeting is to reach a decision at the end on the concept
54541	0	a	and I think the last time we talked about an a lot
54542	0	a	and we had a rough idea of what is going to be ,
54543	1	a	but in th at the end of this meeting we have to to reach a decision .
54544	0	a	So ,
54545	0	a	we will have again three presentation , from all of you , and I hope it will be fast because I would like to have time to for long discussion and and decisions .
54546	1	a	So , who wants to start ?
54547	0	a	Okay .
54548	1	a	I s
54549	0	a	No , no ,
54550	1	a	you you can start .
54551	0	a	Okay .
54552	1	a	Okay , I will start .
54553	0	a	So start ,
54554	1	a	Can you open my presentation ,
54555	0	a	please .
54556	0	a	I am number four .
54557	0	a	Trend .
54558	0	a	This one ?
54559	0	a	Turn .
54560	0	a	Yep .
54561	1	a	Can you pass the mouse ,
54562	0	a	please .
54563	0	a	Oh okay , that is fine .
54564	1	a	Okay .
54565	1	a	so basically I just want to presented to you
54566	1	a	present to you some recent results we have had from looking at some remote control market research and some fashion trends around the world .
54567	0	a	the fashion trends we got from talking to our our contacts in the fashion industry based in Paris and Milan .
54568	0	a	so f from our market research basically we have come to the conclusion that a fancy look and feel , as opposed to a functional look and feel , is our number one priority .
54569	0	a	fancy is is is is the , you know , highest priority .
54570	0	a	Secondly that our remote control needs to be techn technologically innovative .
54571	0	a	so this is
54572	0	a	t number two priority
54573	0	a	but it is two times less important as the fancy criteria .
54574	0	a	and third thirdly the easiness of use is is the is is important as well , but again two times less important as the technologically innovativeness of the remote control .
54575	0	a	From our f fashion people in Paris and Milan , we have discovered that this year fruit the fruit and vegetable motif will be the most important thing in in clothes , shoes and furniture .
54576	0	a	So , I am pretty confident that our remote control fits into the furniture category .
54577	0	a	And also the feel of material this year is expected to be spongy .
54578	0	a	Okay .
54579	0	a	so hopefully our remote control reflects that s in some way .
54580	0	a	What does it mean , spongy ?
54581	0	a	Like soft , or something ?
54582	0	a	Okay .
54583	0	a	sort of squishy .
54584	0	a	Yeah soft , like a like a sponge .
54585	0	a	Like a sponge .
54586	0	a	I do not know .
54587	0	a	Yeah .
54588	0	a	Yeah .
54589	0	a	I will see .
54590	1	a	so in conclusion , we need a our remote control needs to be something that is really fancy , has lots of technolog tech technology in it .
54591	0	a	somehow would be good to have it related to fruit and vegetables with a spongy feel .
54592	0	a	Okay .
54593	0	a	And that it is easy to use and from our last meeting
54594	0	a	our you know Fabian told us that w you know one of the requirements is that we have to reflect the look and feel of our of th the Real Reaction company .
54595	0	a	Yeah ,
54596	0	a	yeah .
54597	0	a	That is it .
54598	0	a	Easy to use , is it a as much as important than technology or fancy thing .
54599	0	a	It is less important ,
54600	0	a	right ?
54601	0	a	Yeah yeah .
54602	0	a	Less important .
54603	0	a	So fanciness first and then two ti you know , half as important as that is technology technology , and half important as technology is easy to use .
54604	0	a	Okay .
54605	0	a	So .
54606	1	a	So , Hamed , can you .
54607	1	a	Yeah .
54608	1	a	The second one .
54609	1	a	Could you please show the presentation number three .
54610	0	a	I think the biggest struggle will be the easy to use feature .
54611	0	a	We will see .
54612	0	a	Yeah .
54613	0	a	Number ?
54614	0	a	Three .
54615	0	a	Three .
54616	0	a	This one ?
54617	0	a	So it is not this one .
54618	0	a	Yes .
54619	1	a	Just Could you please check if it is the first one or the second .
54620	0	a	, n n no , it is the first one .
54621	0	a	The second one .
54622	0	a	yeah .
54623	0	a	Okay .
54624	1	a	Okay .
54625	1	a	So I am going to talk about a little bit about how this remote control should be appear to be more easy to use .
54626	0	a	I think I think the feature easy to use is more important than being fancy ,
54627	1	a	but okay , we can discuss about it later .
54628	0	a	generally , generally this remote control should be should be something , in my opinion , the first feature is just to be easy to use .
54629	1	a	So , the more frequent buttons should be larger , they should be placed in a good position inside the remote control .
54630	1	a	And s I can conclude like this , that we should not need to learn how to use it .
54631	0	a	It should be
54632	1	a	we should not need to es open a a t book and start reading and learning how to use this this remote control .
54633	0	a	Okay .
54634	0	a	So what I found out that as I said I think it is better to put more frequent ke buttons which are used more in the middle of the remote control , and they should be bigger in size .
54635	0	a	the shape of remote control should be in a way which can which should be taken easily in hand .
54636	0	a	It should not be completely like a cube .
54637	0	a	It should be it should have round edge , so then it is easier .
54638	0	a	Exactly .
54639	0	a	And maybe just like some toys , some joystick which is easier to take inside the hand .
54640	0	a	And also f m because because customers does not like to buy lots of battery , it should not consume lots of energy .
54641	1	a	Okay .
54642	1	a	And my personal p preference is , as I said , just putting this buttons in a special places and covered some buttons which are not used that much like settings button , like mobile phone .
54643	0	a	Usually some mobile phone cover the dialling number part ,
54644	1	a	so we can cover these buttons which are not used or number buttons for the for the for the can channels , and just put volume change or s ch can channel change buttons in the remote control .
54645	0	a	And if the user needed to do some more complex task he he can open the cover and then change settings or something like this .
54646	0	a	And also I think if we put some some some some some buttons inside of the remote control it can be used easier .
54647	0	a	Not on remote control .
54648	0	a	I dunno if I can explain well .
54649	0	a	But just inside .
54650	1	a	For example , a sliding or rolling d stuff , if we put it inside then we can easily manipulate with thumb .
54651	0	a	So it can be another preference .
54652	0	a	And I dunno
54653	0	a	but I think usage of a speech recogn r recogniser can be good .
54654	0	a	I know that it consumes lots of energy ,
54655	1	a	but if we do it in some way that it asleeps when there is no sound and when it detects some sound it may consume less energy .
54656	0	a	And I think it is good because it is something new and usually young people like something new .
54657	0	a	So it may not be very useful but because it is new , people may buy it .
54658	0	a	I personally think there should be a big difference between between something .
54659	0	a	Otherwise they prefer to buy something which is coming from a famous company , or .
54660	0	a	Okay .
54661	0	a	That is mine .
54662	0	a	Okay .
54663	0	a	okay , so good news from me for me from Hamed , but bad news from Bob obviously , because spongy design , I do not like it as
54664	1	a	Okay , so could you please , Fabien , open it .
54665	1	a	Yeah .
54666	0	a	I am person two .
54667	0	a	And which one ,
54668	0	a	probably the first one .
54669	0	a	I am not sure
54670	1	a	but check the first one .
54671	1	a	I Most of the things I have to write myself on the board , but
54672	0	a	Yeah , that is it .
54673	0	a	This one , yeah .
54674	0	a	Just
54675	0	a	It is only this slide ?
54676	0	a	Yeah .
54677	0	a	This this is just one thing I wanted to mention and show you that I just I just found this , that our company developed a s a seven f seven fingers
54678	0	a	or I will just
54679	0	a	Yeah ,
54680	0	a	seven seven inch T TFT screen ,
54681	0	a	which is good news for us , since we wanted to include a display there .
54682	0	a	Inch .
54683	1	a	so I I probably draw it down raw scheme .
54684	0	a	Oh , .
54685	0	a	This is this is the stuff that I can use to
54686	0	a	Okay , so the this will be like the overall scheme or overall requirements from the engineering point of view .
54687	0	a	Oops .
54688	0	a	first thing is this will be the overall shape , no I am not speaking about the real shape of the device , but the shape of the inside of the device .
54689	0	a	So there will be some circuit for the power .
54690	0	a	So , say power circuit here .
54691	0	a	the main energy will be taken from batteries
54692	0	a	that we can
54693	0	a	And if we decide to use the speech recognition stuff there , we must use additional source of energy ,
54694	0	a	which I found the best is to use the solar cells which can which can supply everything .
54695	0	a	I was computing all the all the things related to the speech recognition , and it is okay to use just two batteries and solar cells , so .
54696	0	a	So no problem .
54697	0	a	There can be also solar cell .
54698	0	a	the main board with all the circuits will take at least seven to seven centimetres , so this is my like hard requirement for the guys from the design .
54699	0	a	So at least seven to seven .
54700	0	a	It depends where you put your screen , because the screen is seven inch , so it depends on you where where you put it .
54701	0	a	It does not matter .
54702	0	a	it is just one cord from from the main board to the screen which can be elsewhere .
54703	0	a	So this will be TFT .
54704	0	a	And on the main board we have the interface to the microphone , which is somewhere , say here .
54705	0	a	Interface to the microphone .
54706	0	a	Then the graphical card for the TFT and the third unit is the IR .
54707	0	a	The good news is that we can we decided to use the infra red unit
54708	0	a	because our company has also developed the chip for communication by the infra red , including all the stuff inside , so it will be very cheap for us .
54709	0	a	So infra red here .
54710	0	a	So the
54711	0	a	once again the overall requirements , seven to seven centimetres for the board ,
54712	0	a	which has to be
54713	0	a	which can be spongy but has to be this size , and the TFT which is seven inches .
54714	1	a	I have to check what I wanted to
54715	0	a	from my point of view I do not care about the about the material used for the overall des ov all the device .
54716	0	a	Can you fit any for example a TFT or any electronic device in a spongy thing , or is there any problem for that ?
54717	0	a	For example , put electronic card on a spongy thing , I can I can imagine it could be a problem .
54718	0	a	A all these things in in in this box are okay to put in in any shape , basically .
54719	0	a	But we have to take care of the TFT .
54720	0	a	Yep .
54721	0	a	Well , sponginess .
54722	0	a	Maybe it a good feature , since it takes if it is around the TFT
54723	0	a	then it is good , because it is just keeps it safe , I dunno .
54724	0	a	Okay .
54725	0	a	So
54726	0	a	Okay .
54727	1	a	Well maybe it can have two shells , a hard shell inside and a spongy shell outside .
54728	0	a	So So Ca
54729	1	a	Can I ask a question .
54730	1	a	Maybe put electronic in a box and a spongy thing around .
54731	0	a	Well , it is maybe related to the UI .
54732	0	a	maybe after .
54733	0	a	Yeah .
54734	0	a	A
54735	0	a	Yeah , that is all from me .
54736	0	a	This seven inch TFT screen ,
54737	0	a	how big is it in reality ?
54738	0	a	So like that .
54739	0	a	Yeah ?
54740	0	a	Well , seven to seven inches .
54741	0	a	Yes .
54742	0	a	That is quite big .
54743	0	a	have we decided that we are going to use this TFT screen ?
54744	0	a	But I mean even even that is like this big .
54745	0	a	Yeah but To be honest , I was
54746	0	a	Yeah , honestly speaking I was thinking that it was seven centimetres initially , but it is seven inches .
54747	0	a	No , I do not think it is seven by seven , I think it is seven the diagonal is seven .
54748	0	a	Usually when they say seven inch I think it is the diagonal .
54749	0	a	Yeah yes .
54750	0	a	Yeah .
54751	0	a	I dunno
54752	0	a	I dun
54753	0	a	I dun One each
54754	0	a	But , yeah , .
54755	0	a	Yeah .
54756	1	a	But I I think we can we can cut it .
54757	0	a	You can cut the TFT screen .
54758	0	a	Yeah , no no problem ,
54759	0	a	because because because then the size of the graphic card will be one fourth .
54760	0	a	Let is go .
54761	0	a	So
54762	0	a	Yeah , but no problem to to me to cut the screen .
54763	1	a	So let is cut the TFT .
54764	0	a	Okay ,
54765	0	a	so
54766	0	a	Okay .
54767	0	a	So so for the same price we have four screens now .
54768	0	a	These technical engineers , huh .
54769	0	a	So , what is the size of the device ?
54770	0	a	Even from my perspective seven t seven centimetres by seven centimetres is still
54771	0	a	Is it
54772	0	a	Can you hold that , or ?
54773	0	a	Yeah , a small c control that they can hold in hand .
54774	0	a	well this is like this is almost nothing .
54775	0	a	Seven to seven to at least well some three millimetres or something .
54776	0	a	Yeah , but we wanted the big buttons and stuff like that , you know .
54777	0	a	Because if it is t too small we can we can lose it , at home , you know .
54778	0	a	What user wants .
54779	0	a	He wants a small remote control ,
54780	0	a	or ?
54781	0	a	with big buttons .
54782	0	a	I thought that it it should fit in the hand or something .
54783	0	a	Yes .
54784	0	a	It is difficult .
54785	0	a	A sm
54786	1	a	So maybe you can finish your presentation , and afterwards we will discuss about all this .
54787	0	a	But is something that is seven centimetres square e easy to hold ?
54788	0	a	Okay .
54789	0	a	W
54790	0	a	I
54791	0	a	I think so .
54792	0	a	I if the roller buttons are on the side you do not have to catch it like that , but just like this , and you know follow follow
54793	0	a	Well , that is that is no task for me ,
54794	0	a	but well seven to seven at least yeah ,
54795	0	a	but
54796	0	a	Oh , okay .
54797	0	a	Maybe this .
54798	0	a	Okay thanks .
54799	0	a	That is it .
54800	0	a	Okay .
54801	0	a	So .
54802	0	a	No .
54803	0	a	, so I think we have a lot
54804	1	a	We have to take decision today , so I think we have to do some work to finalise our idea and take decisions .
54805	0	a	first I think energy it is a key problem
54806	0	a	because it depend what can we have as feature if we use only batteries , for example , or something like that .
54807	0	a	Because can we have LCD and speech recognition with battery ,
54808	0	a	and it is also r related to the size of the of the devi of the device ?
54809	0	a	Okay .
54810	0	a	Not
54811	1	a	J just a point to the energy th things .
54812	0	a	If we use the batteries , and the additional so solar cell , then it is okay for L speech recognition and LCD ,
54813	0	a	so no problem in energy , I think .
54814	0	a	So
54815	0	a	Okay .
54816	0	a	But we have to use the solar cell .
54817	0	a	So but
54818	0	a	Otherwise not .
54819	0	a	like
54820	0	a	but using how many batteries , for example ?
54821	0	a	Are are what Maybe what is the size of the battery
54822	0	a	Okay .
54823	0	a	Yeah I was thinking just common AA cells .
54824	0	a	one two
54825	0	a	Okay .
54826	0	a	So like three to five centimetres , I dunno exactly , but .
54827	0	a	So if we use s solar cells , where is the sun if someone is watching TV inside ?
54828	0	a	Okay .
54829	0	a	S
54830	0	a	d does not need to be sun .
54831	0	a	It it is just the daylight , you know .
54832	0	a	The television lights .
54833	0	a	Yeah well I I suppose that I suppose that that this remote control wo not be in the in the room like this , where there is light only when when there are people , but .
54834	0	a	At least when there is TV you can get light from the TV .
54835	0	a	Yeah from the T I do not think it is enough , .
54836	0	a	Yeah .
54837	0	a	I dunno .
54838	0	a	Okay .
54839	0	a	Okay .
54840	0	a	it is a it is a compromise , no ?
54841	0	a	Yeah , that is why I wanted to to include the speech recognition , because you wanted all the new things .
54842	0	a	At least it is new and maybe technology New technology .
54843	0	a	It is it is quite innovative , yes .
54844	0	a	Yeah .
54845	0	a	And if you watch TV outside it is very useful .
54846	0	a	So I think before talking about the other thing , it is important thing it is the case .
54847	1	a	what what are going to be the size ,
54848	0	a	because its weight drives the other what we are going to use as features and so on .
54849	0	a	For example for the for the LCD , if we choose to have a small device , we cannot use this a such a a a screen .
54850	0	a	the s the screen is okay , but the board , that is the problem .
54851	1	a	Well what what would you guess as a shape ?
54852	1	a	Or what what would be the shape ?
54853	0	a	I think I think their being large or small is not important .
54854	0	a	The only important thing is to be able to take it in inside hand easily .
54855	1	a	So let is say an average size , okay , and it should not be very heavy also .
54856	1	a	And I prefer to is it should not have a uniform shape , so in the middle it should be a little bit thinner , maybe maybe .
54857	0	a	So we c it is like like some joysticks .
54858	0	a	You can take some some joystick you can take inside hand easier because it is it is designed for your f taking into account your finger shape and your palm shape .
54859	1	a	So the general shape should be like this .
54860	0	a	I think seven centimetre by seven centimetre is a little bit large .
54861	0	a	So seven not seven but let is say five by ten it is
54862	0	a	I think it is that is my opinion .
54863	0	a	Okay .
54864	0	a	Which is the same area .
54865	0	a	It is easier .
54866	0	a	Yeah .
54867	0	a	Could you re could you redesign your board ?
54868	0	a	Oh , five five centimetres by ten centimetres .
54869	0	a	Okay .
54870	0	a	Five to ten .
54871	0	a	Well that
54872	0	a	Yeah , right .
54873	0	a	Yeah .
54874	0	a	Yeah , I think it is feasib
54875	0	a	Well one
54876	0	a	How could we do it ?
54877	1	a	We could put the board next to , well , under the LCD and for example make the LCD be totally unrelated to the thing that you hold in your hand .
54878	1	a	Like holding something , and the LCD to be just on top of it , you know somehow .
54879	1	a	Well But maybe let is stick to the s spongy thing , like one unit .
54880	0	a	Oh .
54881	0	a	I have I s
54882	0	a	I think the easiest thing would be to to have a smaller LCD , if it is possible .
54883	0	a	Well fi five to ten it would be feasible .
54884	0	a	Okay , so five to ten , I I think it is it is feasible .
54885	0	a	Okay .
54886	0	a	So we are agree with a small LCD .
54887	1	a	I will make it .
54888	0	a	Or or I do not know
54889	0	a	but I do not want to now invent something new , because we did not discuss about it .
54890	0	a	Fo Five by ten .
54891	1	a	So using some LCDs we can touch , so we can remove keys and just having , I dunno the name , LCD responding to fingers .
54892	0	a	Yeah .
54893	1	a	Touching the screen .
54894	1	a	Something like
54895	0	a	like tactile .
54896	0	a	Tactile or something , yeah .
54897	0	a	, touch screen .
54898	0	a	Touch screen , yeah .
54899	0	a	So
54900	0	a	But for now if we do not want to use such kind of screens
54901	0	a	I
54902	0	a	I think we using a a smaller screen is better ,
54903	0	a	because A smaller s
54904	0	a	Okay .
54905	0	a	Yeah .
54906	0	a	The problem is we have a limit in a month of time , so we cannot do something very new .
54907	1	a	So let is go for a small LCD .
54908	0	a	So
54909	0	a	Well it is it is definitely the obvious choice , with the colour of our company .
54910	0	a	Okay , so
54911	1	a	Yeah , so so just just give me the the the five by ten numbers that you find the best and send it me
54912	1	a	and I will work it out .
54913	0	a	Yeah okay .
54914	0	a	So , five by s ten .
54915	0	a	so what about , so the case we talked about .
54916	0	a	something easy to use ,
54917	1	a	you said something easy to use but how does that fit in a fashion way , like with fruit and vegetable , and about the colour and logo of the of the company and so on , now , can we do that ?
54918	1	a	My first idea is because our colour is more yellow , and the it should be easy to take in a hand , I thought about banana , or something like that , which is fruits , and
54919	0	a	A big banana .
54920	0	a	Seven to ten banana .
54921	0	a	Okay .
54922	1	a	Rather mango or something or .
54923	0	a	Yeah .
54924	0	a	I mean what other what other fruit and vegetables
54925	0	a	Do you know of any any other fruit and vegetables that are yellow ?
54926	0	a	Well
54927	0	a	I would like a shaped screen .
54928	0	a	Yeah .
54929	0	a	But it is just an idea .
54930	0	a	I dunno what you think about , but
54931	0	a	Yeah .
54932	0	a	I dunno if it can fit with the technology .
54933	0	a	You are the specialists of that .
54934	0	a	You mean banana .
54935	0	a	Well , but If it is If it
54936	0	a	If the banana is big enough .
54937	0	a	Then , yes .
54938	0	a	So
54939	0	a	Yeah , and
54940	0	a	The screen has to be square ?
54941	0	a	Or it can be like a a shape , quite , with curves .
54942	0	a	But if you want to look at the screen , no .
54943	0	a	Well
54944	0	a	Well , it can be whatever you want .
54945	0	a	I think this is not good .
54946	0	a	But if it is square then we get four screens out of one by cutting just .
54947	0	a	It could .
54948	0	a	But if you want some shape then we can only get like two screens out of seven to seven inches , so .
54949	0	a	Yeah .
54950	0	a	It is like more more expensive to have shape like that .
54951	0	a	But I do not care .
54952	0	a	You know , if we fit this requirement .
54953	0	a	I think that is more important than saving a bit of money on on the TFT screen .
54954	0	a	Okay
54955	1	a	Yeah , m maybe the banana could be like a bit fatter than than the c c common one .
54956	0	a	Okay okay .
54957	0	a	Yeah .
54958	0	a	Yeah , it should remember banana , but it is not does not have to b to be really the size and exactly the shape of a banana .
54959	0	a	But
54960	0	a	Like modified banana , okay .
54961	0	a	Well it we will stick to banana , or ?
54962	0	a	Okay .
54963	0	a	So we are agree with the banana thing ?
54964	0	a	Okay .
54965	0	a	Okay .
54966	0	a	Yeah , banana is good .
54967	0	a	Okay .
54968	0	a	Mm mm .
54969	0	a	So , the last point we decided it is infra red , I guess .
54970	0	a	Yeah , I think infra red .
54971	0	a	Yeah ,
54972	0	a	yeah .
54973	0	a	Everybody is agreed .
54974	0	a	Sure .
54975	0	a	, so that is it I think about the concepts .
54976	1	a	You have other thing to add to this point , or no ?
54977	0	a	So , about the user interface , so we are going to use LCD .
54978	0	a	In the last meeting we talked about hidden buttons .
54979	0	a	I do not know what we are going to do with that .
54980	0	a	You talked about the buttons on the side
54981	0	a	what ?
54982	0	a	Yeah .
54983	1	a	Like like peeling of the banana
54984	1	a	you s
54985	0	a	It would be cool , yeah .
54986	0	a	Yeah , peeling of the banana .
54987	0	a	Peeling of the banana , you know , should should discover the other buttons , which are hidden .
54988	0	a	Yeah .
54989	0	a	Okay .
54990	0	a	And you mean the first layer would be spongy .
54991	0	a	Yeah .
54992	0	a	First layer obviously spo
54993	0	a	Yeah , w It is it is like silly , but the people will really appreciate it ,
54994	0	a	yeah
54995	0	a	I think .
54996	0	a	So
54997	0	a	Is it is it possible to do that ?
54998	0	a	It would be a great idea ,
54999	0	a	but is it possible technically ?
55000	0	a	Like doing a spongy layer of the banana , and you open it .
55001	0	a	I think if we if we have a spongy layer on the outside of the banana then it is easy to make that ,
55002	0	a	you know , to manipulate that to hav be a cover that you can pull off and
55003	0	a	I think for sure .
55004	0	a	Yeah .
55005	0	a	Yeah .
55006	0	a	Yeah , some
55007	1	a	Something like a plastic cover covering some interface , USB interface as in the in digital camera .
55008	0	a	Yeah .
55009	1	a	If you see it is like peeling .
55010	1	a	You open a plastic cover and you see some USB interfaces , some some interfaces for adaptor .
55011	1	a	So keys can be buttons can be covered like this , with a plastic cover and when and when you open this cover it is like peeling a banana .
55012	1	a	So , something like this .
55013	0	a	Yeah , but do you see that as a rigid thing , or like like a banana , something very soft , you can open like banana , or .
55014	0	a	Well is it possible to make it soft ?
55015	0	a	So I think if it is so then it is cool ?
55016	0	a	Cool .
55017	0	a	Yeah ,
55018	0	a	yeah ,
55019	0	a	yeah
55020	0	a	it is a lic like a plastic cover , so .
55021	0	a	Yeah .
55022	0	a	So , I dunno what you think , Bob ,
55023	0	a	but it would be great for users I think , and very good for marketing .
55024	0	a	Definitely .
55025	0	a	The softer the better .
55026	0	a	Yeah .
55027	0	a	Yeah .
55028	0	a	Honestly speaking , I cannot imagine it , so far , but it will be terrible .
55029	0	a	Yeah .
55030	0	a	And setting buttons hidden in .
55031	0	a	, other remarks , or something , or .
55032	1	a	Something we did not talk about yes yet , or .
55033	0	a	I think we are almost there .
55034	1	a	maybe , how can we , if we have a soft thing , like this , and to open it we have to attach it somewhere ,
55035	1	a	I dunno how to do that technically , or .
55036	0	a	And how
55037	0	a	Yeah , maybe .
55038	0	a	Pof .
55039	1	a	We could use Velcro .
55040	1	a	Or ma maybe a magnetic thing .
55041	0	a	Yes , yeah it is a good idea .
55042	0	a	Magnetic .
55043	0	a	Ma magnetic
55044	0	a	oh .
55045	0	a	Yeah or a
55046	0	a	Yeah it can is
55047	1	a	it can be a plastic cover sticking to the to the all the stuff like with magnetic p magnetic magnetic materials in the border , so it is it sticks like refrigerator door , completely .
55048	0	a	Okay .
55049	0	a	And when you try to open it , it will be opened easily .
55050	0	a	So you you can be sure that it will not be open while you are while while you are commonly using buttons on the banana .
55051	0	a	Okay .
55052	1	a	And what would be the matter here of the first layer I mean ?
55053	0	a	Likes .
55054	0	a	Soft plastic , or
55055	0	a	Yeah ,
55056	0	a	yeah ,
55057	0	a	yeah .
55058	1	a	Yeah , I imagine some sort of vinyl thing .
55059	1	a	In a in a sort of a with a suede sort of feel .
55060	1	a	Maybe .
55061	0	a	Well since since the since the things like the like the screen and how to say that , solar cell has to be has to be like kept kept in the shape ,
55062	0	a	we cannot b
55063	0	a	So we need that the that the peeling
55064	0	a	I dunno
55065	1	a	but we should we should take care of these two two things .
55066	0	a	So , if if the solar cell wo not be visible while the banana is closed , then the material must be able to put the light inside , you know .
55067	0	a	So that we can reach the energy out of it out of that .
55068	0	a	So you are saying is it possible to have a solar cell and this removable cover and And a and a banana .
55069	0	a	It is possible , but , well if it I dunno .
55070	0	a	I dunno how to how to do it if if t if to if it is better to put the solar cell to the t to the peeling or outside it , or or inside .
55071	0	a	Yeah .
55072	0	a	But then it must be some window there , you know .
55073	0	a	Okay .
55074	0	a	And something we forgot , maybe ,
55075	0	a	about the speech recognition system , are we going to use it , or not ?
55076	0	a	It i
55077	0	a	Yeah , it seems feasible , and it would be something very great .
55078	0	a	Yes , I think .
55079	0	a	I think it is important .
55080	0	a	I think so .
55081	0	a	I think One of our p priorities is tech technology .
55082	0	a	And
55083	0	a	So we have the de design , the a good shape , new and so on , and we have also the technology thing w will be .
55084	0	a	And even the easy to use thing ,
55085	0	a	so it will be perfect .
55086	0	a	So we add also the speech recognition device .
55087	0	a	Yeah .
55088	0	a	Yeah .
55089	0	a	I agree .
55090	0	a	So , that great .
55091	0	a	We have decided everything .
55092	0	a	And think we are on a good way .
55093	0	a	So , the next meeting will start in thirty minutes .
55094	0	a	, so the the Industrial Manager will will work on the look and feel design .
55095	0	a	The User Interface Mana Manager will work on the user interface device .
55096	0	a	And the the Marketing Expert will do the first project evaluation .
55097	0	a	Okay .
55098	0	a	So , I hope you can do that in thirty minutes .
55099	0	a	And , yeah , I
55100	1	a	I think you should work together , s you Hamed and Peter , to work in a in a first prototype ,
55101	0	a	and more about the shape and so on and how you can manage to put everything together .
55102	0	a	And as usual you will receive some specific instructions on .
55103	0	a	So thank you all everybody ,
55104	0	a	Okay .
55105	0	a	Okay .
55106	0	a	 
55107	0	a	Oops .
55108	0	a	So , hello everyone .
55109	0	a	We are here to have a kick off meeting for the design of a f for the beginning of new project remote control for the design for a new remote control .
55110	0	a	I am the Project Manager Christa Pavlov
55111	1	a	and okay let is begin .
55112	0	a	So
55113	0	a	I am first going to do an opening then we get used to one anothers and we speak about this tool we are going to design and try to make a project plan , some discussion
55114	0	a	and then we talk of the next meeting .
55115	0	a	So we want to to do a new remote control .
55116	0	a	It has to be original , trendy and user friendly .
55117	0	a	I think the important points we have to t talk about are it is functional design , it is conceptual design , and desail detailed design .
55118	0	a	and for that we are going all to work individually and then have meeting during the whole day .
55119	1	a	, so let is try the whiteboard .
55120	0	a	Wow .
55121	1	a	so any of you who want to go .
55122	1	a	Yeah , for favourite animals .
55123	0	a	It is going to be not my favourite one but the one I can draw .

55180	0	a	Smile fish .
55181	0	a	A smiling fish .
55182	0	a	Okay .
55183	0	a	So , w whiteboard is working ?
55184	0	a	Good .
55185	0	a	Yeah .
55186	0	a	Yeah .
55187	1	a	Next .
55188	0	a	Next .
55189	1	a	Let is talk about money .
55190	0	a	Just tr try to guess who is a User Interface Designer .
55191	0	a	Yeah , well .
55192	0	a	According to the drawings .
55193	0	a	Not me .
55194	0	a	Yeah , you are
55195	0	a	Okay .
55196	0	a	So .
55197	0	a	So .
55198	0	a	Twenty five Euro for a remote control .
55199	0	a	Yeah ,
55200	0	a	that is the price we want to
55201	0	a	that is the aim for the price for the remote control .
55202	0	a	Okay .
55203	0	a	We aim to do this profit .
55204	0	a	it is big number .
55205	0	a	On the international market .
55206	0	a	Yeah .
55207	0	a	Yeah , we are to sell two million then .
55208	0	a	Wow .
55209	0	a	for a production cost of twelve fifty Euros maximum .
55210	0	a	Kay .
55211	0	a	So any of you have experience in remote controls ?
55212	0	a	That
55213	0	a	So that could be a great application .
55214	0	a	yes , we have plenty at home .
55215	0	a	yeah .
55216	0	a	In fact , my daughter likes l remote controls .
55217	0	a	To eat ?
55218	0	a	Children proof .
55219	0	a	To eat ?
55220	0	a	Yeah , mainly , and to break .
55221	0	a	Remote controls children proof .
55222	0	a	Yeah .
55223	0	a	yeah .
55224	0	a	So she likes buttons which make click ,
55225	1	a	so it has to click .
55226	0	a	Yeah , pret
55227	0	a	Yeah .
55228	0	a	Okay .
55229	0	a	So they have to be waterproof maybe ?
55230	0	a	Cause they eat she ate it .
55231	1	a	It has to be wha baby proof
55232	0	a	yeah
55233	1	a	but mainly it has to be very robust
55234	0	a	because even if she is not very tall she is high enough so that when she throw it away it is
55235	1	a	So it has to be very robust .
55236	0	a	Okay , unbreakable .
55237	0	a	Unbreakable , yeah .
55238	0	a	Uh huh .
55239	1	a	Yeah , we have some child lock or something , yeah .
55240	0	a	And
55241	1	a	it has to be nice looking , colourful , maybe
55242	0	a	colourful , because nobody has colourful remote control
55243	0	a	, they are always black , yeah ,
55244	1	a	but this one could be I dunno , purple or b
55245	0	a	Yeah ,
55246	0	a	yeah .
55247	0	a	Yeah .
55248	0	a	Colourful , yeah .
55249	0	a	Colourful ?
55250	0	a	That is not practical .
55251	0	a	Yeah .
55252	0	a	No , that is a good idea .
55253	0	a	Yeah , it is always black or yeah .
55254	0	a	mm mm .
55255	0	a	No .
55256	0	a	But how going to
55257	0	a	okay ,
55258	0	a	just but it is monochrome it is
55259	0	a	n it is not like
55260	0	a	Otherwise you will never find it .
55261	0	a	Yeah .
55262	0	a	Yeah .
55263	0	a	No ,
55264	0	a	because you think , why not .
55265	0	a	Yeah .
55266	0	a	One colour .
55267	0	a	Yeah .
55268	0	a	Yeah ,
55269	0	a	yeah .
55270	1	a	Yeah even we can change colours , no ?
55271	0	a	Like the
55272	0	a	like the phones and these things we c
55273	0	a	yeah .
55274	0	a	Oh like the phones , yeah , it could change colours , yeah .
55275	0	a	Cool .
55276	1	a	At least for children like one colour and .
55277	0	a	Ch
55278	0	a	Yeah , but without any extremes like n not of this size , not too large .
55279	0	a	Yeah .
55280	0	a	Good .
55281	0	a	Good idea .
55282	1	a	And it should be really small and .
55283	0	a	Small also ?
55284	0	a	Do not you think
55285	0	a	No , not too much buttons or .
55286	0	a	Huh not so big like
55287	0	a	yeah .
55288	0	a	Yeah , not too much buttons and
55289	1	a	Should it be , y you know these remote controls where they are what they call a universal ret remote control
55290	0	a	so y you can decide that now it is the remote control for the television , then it is the remote control for the the sound system , or for your refrigerator
55291	0	a	whatever
55292	0	a	I dunno if it is
55293	0	a	Or if we should have a targeted re remote control .
55294	0	a	Yeah .
55295	0	a	Yeah ,
55296	0	a	that is
55297	0	a	Okay .
55298	0	a	So , I think there is
55299	0	a	So you you think it is better if small than bigger .
55300	0	a	So colour , robustness , easy to use , size , yeah , size matters , yeah .
55301	0	a	Yeah .
55302	0	a	Colour , size , sh
55303	0	a	Yeah , maybe at least n not bigger than this I guess .
55304	0	a	No , not too small , yeah .
55305	0	a	Yeah yeah ,
55306	0	a	at least it should hold in your hand n properly , like .
55307	0	a	Okay .
55308	0	a	Yeah .
55309	0	a	Yeah , like a palm sized .
55310	0	a	Yeah .
55311	0	a	Just to hold it .
55312	0	a	Okay .
55313	1	a	But what would be different from this , from the others ?
55314	0	a	I dunno if
55315	0	a	Yeah , at least the colour would be different .
55316	1	a	maybe we can change the colours that at least the frame .
55317	0	a	S
55318	0	a	so then it depends
55319	0	a	you are to
55320	0	a	I mean you c you can easily remove the frame .
55321	0	a	I think one thing important for instance in this remote control if you remember when people use it
55322	0	a	they are they never find a good button in the right place .
55323	0	a	Yeah ,
55324	0	a	yeah .
55325	0	a	For some reason they they they click the off button when they want to use the
55326	0	a	So there is a problem in the design of that kind of remote control somehow ,
55327	0	a	I dunno .
55328	0	a	Yeah .
55329	0	a	Yeah .
55330	1	a	So , some kind of idea with cellular phone with a a screen that will tell you what
55331	0	a	no .
55332	0	a	No , no screens , it is too complex .
55333	0	a	Okay .
55334	0	a	Too expensive for twelve Euro ?
55335	0	a	Too expensive , yeah .
55336	0	a	And n maybe not too expensive ,
55337	0	a	well it is not my problem ,
55338	0	a	but well okay .
55339	0	a	And too expensive .
55340	0	a	But no screens on remote controls .
55341	1	a	I thought it could be only a screen which would change depending on the use or even the user .
55342	1	a	So ma I prefer to have the off button at the top right ,
55343	0	a	so I would have my own design of the remote control because it is in fact just a a full touch screen remote control ,
55344	0	a	if you if you like .
55345	0	a	yeah .
55346	0	a	I mean it it is like
55347	0	a	it is like two types no ?
55348	0	a	people are right handed or left handed so y because I am left handed
55349	0	a	I use like this , say if you are right handed you use like this
55350	1	a	or so tha
55351	1	a	your switch on and off should be on
55352	0	a	yeah .
55353	0	a	I do not know if it makes sense , but
55354	0	a	Yeah , for instance , .
55355	0	a	Mm mm .
55356	0	a	So adaptable
55357	0	a	yeah something
55358	0	a	yeah .
55359	0	a	Adaptable .
55360	0	a	Maybe , if if it is possible , yeah .
55361	0	a	Alright , good ,
55362	0	a	so how many actions do we need to implement in it ?
55363	0	a	On off ?
55364	1	a	I mean if it is less than three then we can make it like a
55365	0	a	like three mental states ,
55366	0	a	yeah you know what I mean ,
55367	0	a	we can just make it controlled by a brain , huh ?
55368	0	a	huh .
55369	1	a	Maybe I think even we can keep two switches and then we can only make one working .
55370	0	a	Yeah .
55371	1	a	We can adapt only one switch , suppose here like we can make two switches
55372	0	a	and if I am left hander I use this switch to follow the main operations .
55373	0	a	Two .
55374	0	a	Three buttons you mean ?
55375	0	a	Three option .
55376	0	a	Yeah .
55377	0	a	Yeah .
55378	0	a	, yeah , sure .
55379	1	a	Maybe if it is more , if there is a software inside
55380	0	a	that ask you three
55381	0	a	If it if we want a r universal remote control that we sa like we say before it may may need more than three three button , three possibilities , yeah .
55382	0	a	Sh sure , sure .
55383	0	a	Yeah ,
55384	0	a	more than three actions that you may want to do at a given time .
55385	0	a	yeah .
55386	0	a	Yeah .
55387	0	a	But for standard actions you usually what do you do , you change channels , you adjust volume , and nothing else .
55388	0	a	Yeah
55389	0	a	but for instance when you change channels you can have you can just go to the next one or go to channel twenty five .
55390	0	a	Yeah .
55391	0	a	And that is already more complex to go to channel twenty five .
55392	0	a	You do this ?
55393	0	a	I usually just change channels .
55394	0	a	Yeah .
55395	0	a	no .
55396	0	a	Because I am only using three or four channels
55397	0	a	but And then back to the one I was before , so there is whichever it was .
55398	0	a	Yeah .
55399	0	a	But they keep generally their t slash slash this thing and then the dash dash and then you can put
55400	0	a	yeah ,
55401	0	a	you can only have one bit .
55402	0	a	Yeah .
55403	0	a	I change channel like this , m I want to go to twenty five , and then to ten , uh huh
55404	0	a	yeah .
55405	0	a	Dash .
55406	0	a	Also we can be here
55407	0	a	yeah ,
55408	0	a	that would be cool .
55409	0	a	Uh huh .
55410	0	a	Yeah you can
55411	0	a	yeah .
55412	0	a	Go back button is good .
55413	0	a	Yeah .
55414	0	a	Yeah .
55415	0	a	we had that in in other countries .
55416	0	a	I once had it .
55417	0	a	Yeah
55418	0	a	yeah , the previous button is .
55419	0	a	yeah .
55420	1	a	Yeah e even the history
55421	1	a	so you could like undo previous of the previous .
55422	0	a	, okay .
55423	0	a	History .
55424	0	a	Oh .
55425	0	a	Then you can watch what your you could also record your record your sequence of actions , that becomes more complex , but you could look at what the other people have used there or remote controls .
55426	0	a	Yeah .
55427	0	a	Yeah
55428	0	a	yeah ,
55429	0	a	what the which channels the viewer Marketing
55430	0	a	yeah .
55431	0	a	Mm mm .
55432	0	a	Yeah
55433	0	a	maybe it is a
55434	0	a	Okay .
55435	0	a	Okay .
55436	0	a	So I think we have full of idea .
55437	0	a	we are going to meet again in thirty minutes and I want you to work on these ideas
55438	1	a	and try to make a the ones , make to decide what what are the ones important and what are the one that we do not want .
55439	1	a	And m maybe more in the technical parts what do we want to do .
55440	0	a	So your personal coach will send you some instruction for for this thirty minutes .
55441	0	a	So what does ME means ?
55442	0	a	ME the user requirements ?

55468	0	a	so
55469	0	a	we need to know the the user needs
55470	0	a	that we want to fulfil to fulfil the from the technical part
55471	1	a	we want to know how it going to work
55472	0	a	and
55473	0	a	third part I do not remember
55474	0	a	which is not very good .
55475	0	a	of course ,
55476	1	a	how to to design this this
55477	0	a	yeah .
55478	1	a	Nice stuff
55479	1	a	Who starts ?
55480	0	a	Oh .

55484	0	a	okay .
55485	1	a	So wait a minute .
55486	0	a	So I dunno if I can do that like this ?
55487	0	a	Yeah ?
55488	0	a	So
55489	0	a	it is being modified .
55490	0	a	Do you want yeah , open .
55491	0	a	Read only .
55492	0	a	I hope I saved it .
55493	0	a	So ,
55494	0	a	yeah ,
55495	0	a	this is my name .
55496	0	a	Sammy Benjo .
55497	0	a	I know this name .
55498	0	a	Sounds
55499	0	a	We met before .
55500	0	a	So as you know , you
55501	0	a	I think you already know me , Sammy Benjo .
55502	0	a	I am the expert in marketing
55503	1	a	and I want to tell you about what people s want and like and dislike in remote controls ,
55504	0	a	and I hope this is going to help you to to design it correctly .
55505	0	a	So
55506	1	a	next please .
55507	0	a	Uh oh .
55508	0	a	Yeah ,
55509	1	a	it is put F five .
55510	1	a	The full page presentation ,
55511	0	a	yep .
55512	0	a	Yeah
55513	1	a	maybe in the full page
55514	0	a	because i I spent lots of time doing this presentation , so .
55515	1	a	F F five .
55516	0	a	Okay .
55517	0	a	Yeah .
55518	0	a	Yep .
55519	0	a	F five .
55520	0	a	Yeah .
55521	0	a	Uh huh okay .
55522	0	a	So basically
55523	1	a	what I suggest is that instead of deciding ourself what what could be and what should be a good remote control , let is ask people who are users of remote controls
55524	0	a	how they feel about w the current remote controls ,
55525	0	a	what they like , what they do not like
55526	0	a	and
55527	0	a	and what they do with them by the way
55528	0	a	because they are supposed to be useful .
55529	1	a	Do not forget about that .
55530	0	a	So we have we have conducted a a survey on on the use of remote controls
55531	1	a	and I would like to show you some of the results we found on this survey .
55532	1	a	And next please .
55533	0	a	Yeah , so basically
55534	0	a	what we found was that there are several things that the user do not like in remote controls .
55535	0	a	First of all , they find it very ugly .
55536	0	a	Current remote controls as you know they are the same as this one
55537	0	a	they are not nice colour , not nice shape ,
55538	0	a	I mean they are all the same , and they are not l good looking .
55539	0	a	what is interesting
55540	0	a	is that in fact it seems that they were people are ready to pay for nice and look and fancy looking remote control ,
55541	1	a	so I think we should probably spend lots of time in and effort in that .
55542	0	a	And the other thing is that the the current remote controls are not so easy to use and it it the the current facilities that they offer do not match what people really want to use their remote controls .
55543	0	a	For instance we see that they zap very often
55544	0	a	so I think this is a very important functionality
55545	1	a	that it should be easy for them to to zap in one way or another .
55546	0	a	And most of the buttons on current remote controls are not used ,
55547	1	a	so I think we should design something where some of the buttons which are those that are used should be easier to see and use than others that only a couple of people are using .
55548	1	a	next please .
55549	0	a	Now
55550	0	a	people are very frustrated w with their remote controls and they for instance they do not even find it it is it is often lost somewhere in the in the in your home
55551	0	a	and nobody knows where it is .
55552	0	a	Yeah .
55553	1	a	Maybe if we have something where we could ask the remote control please , where are you ?
55554	0	a	Like something to to like t I think phones .
55555	0	a	Agree .
55556	0	a	Yeah .
55557	0	a	Yeah .
55558	0	a	Some of the phones have some of this kind of s functionality .
55559	0	a	of course phone you can always phone your phone
55560	0	a	but you ca not phone your your remote control .
55561	0	a	You can you are .
55562	0	a	Why not ?
55563	0	a	Okay tha that is look great .
55564	0	a	But why not ?
55565	0	a	Yeah .
55566	0	a	And because of the fact that there are so many buttons in these remote controls that nobody use , in fact they do not even know how to use them , so most of the the people say they they do not know how to they to use properly their r remote controls .
55567	0	a	And they are bad for RSI
55568	0	a	but I do not remember what is RSI .
55569	0	a	So I think they are bad .
55570	0	a	RSI .
55571	0	a	nobody has any idea about that ?
55572	0	a	Well I will check with my
55573	0	a	Oh , okay ,
55574	0	a	I think it is a technical thing
55575	0	a	which our
55576	0	a	Okay .
55577	0	a	Yeah , it is electromagnetic waves or something kind of maybe effect .
55578	0	a	No , I do not think so .
55579	0	a	Yeah ,
55580	0	a	because infrared uses some electromagnetic technology , and those waves have high
55581	0	a	Okay .
55582	0	a	Okay .
55583	0	a	So ,
55584	0	a	it seems that it is a lot of people for a concept that we do not know
55585	1	a	but we have to take this into account .
55586	0	a	But twenty six percent , do you know
55587	0	a	Twenty five .
55588	0	a	Or something we do not know .
55589	0	a	Every fourth , you know .
55590	0	a	Yeah it is People really
55591	0	a	Yeah .
55592	0	a	Every four some of us knows .
55593	1	a	Okay .
55594	0	a	So anyway
55595	0	a	that is for what the biggest frustration of the user
55596	0	a	and
55597	0	a	what else do I have ?
55598	1	a	Next slide ?
55599	0	a	yeah .
55600	0	a	One of us
55601	0	a	Yeah .
55602	0	a	So we have listed a couple of s functions that may be used by u the user in the current available remote controls
55603	0	a	and well
55604	0	a	the tables look very nice to read but what is important
55605	0	a	is to understand that the power button is not used often because in general you use it only once per session , but it is very relevant .
55606	0	a	Functions .
55607	0	a	People want to have a power button .
55608	0	a	Channel selection is o often used very often used and indeed very relevant .
55609	0	a	now I remember what is RSI it is repetitivity stress injury .
55610	0	a	We have to be careful with that word
55611	0	a	but anyway
55612	1	a	I continue my presentation
55613	0	a	so yeah ,
55614	0	a	channel selection is very important , very often used .
55615	0	a	Volume is not often used but people want to have control on volume
55616	0	a	and that makes sense of course .
55617	0	a	And n then you have things which are very much less often used like the settings .
55618	0	a	Audio settings , screen settings , even teletext and channel settings .
55619	0	a	All of them .
55620	0	a	they are not often used and they are s more or less relevant .
55621	0	a	It seems that people find teletext teletext relevant , even if I personally never use it but seems that it is average relevant at least , so .
55622	0	a	I have been told that we do not consider teletext , that it is out of date now because of internet .
55623	0	a	I can tell you that in a l in a scale between one and ten relevant not relevant to relevant people scored a six on this , which is not as these these two one were had
55624	0	a	I think ten I think .
55625	0	a	But but if you compare with these ones , I think they scored a one or two .
55626	0	a	Not very relevant , so
55627	0	a	if if there are good reason not to put teletext it is okay
55628	0	a	but just know that people find it somehow relevant .
55629	0	a	Mm mm .
55630	0	a	That is for the main functions I think
55631	1	a	and then we can ask ourself what people do not have that may be useful .
55632	0	a	For instance I think net
55633	1	a	next slide .
55634	0	a	One of the thing the trend that you are probably aware of is the possibility the eventual possibility of having speech recognition in your remote control , so you would not have to tap tap in your buttons but just tell your remote control or whatever you need you have what you want .
55635	0	a	So we have conducted a survey about whether people would like or not to have this kind of functionality in their remote control and as we can see it really depends on the age .
55636	0	a	Young people , probably because it is a buzz word , find it very relevant .
55637	0	a	And as the age goes up the the relevance goes down .
55638	0	a	Yeah .
55639	0	a	So now it really depends on the kind of targeting wha who are we targeting with this remote control ?
55640	1	a	I think if we are targeting young people then it is probably something we have to consider .
55641	0	a	Cause
55642	0	a	Thank you .
55643	0	a	If we are targeting you very old people this is something they really do not know why they this should be
55644	0	a	so now
55645	0	a	this is of course ,
55646	0	a	depends on that .
55647	0	a	Okay .
55648	0	a	And I do not have any conclusion , I did not have time
55649	0	a	the meeting was very tight ,
55650	0	a	so that is basically my findings .
55651	0	a	And ,
55652	0	a	if you have any question ?
55653	1	a	I can go back .
55654	0	a	I think it is good , okay .
55655	0	a	You done a good review .
55656	0	a	I got one question , you are a Market Expert
55657	0	a	so
55658	1	a	should we aim at the young people or not ?
55659	0	a	Okay ,
55660	0	a	then teletext is used less .
55661	0	a	Yeah one question ,
55662	1	a	yeah ?
55663	0	a	I am .
55664	1	a	I think we should aim at the young people .
55665	0	a	But I think they are they are those who might be more interested in a in a new device .
55666	0	a	In general the the early adopters of a new device are young people ,
55667	0	a	less than more than
55668	0	a	Then teletext is useless for them I think , yeah .
55669	0	a	Okay .
55670	0	a	Because they they have other means of finding their information .
55671	0	a	Yeah .
55672	0	a	Okay .
55673	0	a	But yeah .
55674	0	a	That is good point .
55675	0	a	, yep .
55676	0	a	Okay .
55677	0	a	Nope .
55678	0	a	Kay ?
55679	0	a	So I think it is you , huh ?
55680	0	a	No ?
55681	0	a	No ,
55682	1	a	user requiremen
55683	0	a	Makes sense .
55684	0	a	Okay .
55685	0	a	Thank you .
55686	0	a	So
55687	0	a	now I think it is the turn of the the I am not sure Of the technical function ,
55688	0	a	so
55689	0	a	what effect
55690	0	a	Okay .
55691	0	a	it is
55692	0	a	techni function of
55693	0	a	Yeah .
55694	0	a	That is me .
55695	1	a	Wait a second .
55696	0	a	I have to do working design so
55697	0	a	Argh .
55698	0	a	So
55699	0	a	you are
55700	0	a	Okay .
55701	0	a	That is but this but number three ,
55702	0	a	yes .
55703	0	a	So ,
55704	0	a	my name is Mark Dwight , and I am responsible for User Interface Design .
55705	0	a	However , Project Manager asked me to give you some presentation about technical functions design .
55706	0	a	, as I am a more an artist
55707	1	a	that is going to be less technical functions but more User Interface and current intentions and everything which is linked with this .
55708	1	a	So next slide please .
55709	0	a	Let is go .
55710	0	a	And a general method which is seems to be very useful for our task
55711	1	a	is not to forget about Occam razor .
55712	1	a	We should never complicate things too much .
55713	1	a	We should only make a remote control , nothing more .
55714	1	a	Nothing more than this , just a remote control .
55715	0	a	Cause current remote controls they are never easy enough to use .
55716	1	a	So , make a click , please .
55717	0	a	So here is this remote control .
55718	0	a	It is quite a standard one , but it is not from a TV , it is from a much easier device like air conditioning or something .
55719	1	a	But you know , we can use it for a TV easily .
55720	1	a	Only buttons we need is on off , volume , channels and maybe some options or something else , and please make a click ,
55721	0	a	compared to this one which one would you prefer ?
55722	0	a	I guess this .
55723	0	a	It is
55724	0	a	Yeah ,
55725	0	a	yeah .
55726	0	a	I would say the simplest one as long as there are the I find the buttons that I need every time I need a button .
55727	0	a	Sure , sure .
55728	0	a	Yeah .
55729	1	a	Maybe it can be yeah middle of like , between those two
55730	0	a	li S you should
55731	0	a	yeah .
55732	0	a	Yeah ,
55733	1	a	and our method is going to be , provide simple simple desires into simple actions .
55734	0	a	Oh sorry .
55735	0	a	Nice .
55736	0	a	Nice sentence .
55737	0	a	Findings .
55738	0	a	Okay .
55739	0	a	Oh sorry .
55740	0	a	Our question of the style , we should remember that our company puts fashion into electronics
55741	1	a	and we should never forget about it .
55742	0	a	Concept .
55743	1	a	Be simple .
55744	1	a	Be simple
55745	0	a	and you will lean on this market .
55746	0	a	Market is a of remote controls you know it better ,
55747	0	a	it is very
55748	0	a	well ,
55749	0	a	it is it is not an easy field to to play ,
55750	0	a	you know ?
55751	1	a	So be simple .
55752	1	a	For personal preferences I think that to make a baby proof remote control it got to be a titanium .
55753	0	a	It is a really good style ,
55754	0	a	it going to be look like like this .
55755	0	a	It is unbreakable and it is very universal .
55756	1	a	W we will have a screen with a back light which can change colours , and we can put all the options into this screen .
55757	1	a	We will need only few buttons .
55758	1	a	All the other things can be controlled through the screen .
55759	1	a	And all these buttons should be easy to find and to click ,
55760	0	a	cause when you watch a movie and you want to change something , you always try to find a good button and click it ,
55761	1	a	but you should do it by touching it and finding it easily just by touch .
55762	0	a	So
55763	1	a	Press I would propose this concept for design , just few buttons , a screen with a back light which can change colours , titanium I think ,
55764	0	a	and what else ?
55765	0	a	I got just very few and good ideas .
55766	1	a	We need power and volume .
55767	1	a	And let us include two nice features into this device , first , power on and off can be made fully automatic .
55768	0	a	When you go to the sofa , take your control and point it to the TV , the TV turns on .
55769	0	a	It is off .
55770	0	a	It is on .
55771	0	a	And when does it turn off ?
55772	0	a	Oh
55773	0	a	so you have a sensing sensor machine that knows
55774	0	a	Tech
55775	0	a	When you do not touch the control but you go out of the For for enough time
55776	0	a	like you
55777	0	a	It is a question to our technical design , our two engineers .
55778	1	a	And another nice feature that I would like to implement is volume control .
55779	0	a	Suppose you set u you set up some volume and then you move out or you move to the other corner of the room and take your control with you .
55780	1	a	Like , you want to to change the chair or you want to move to the armchair from the sofa or something , and then the volume changes .
55781	0	a	Or you want to go to the kitchen .
55782	0	a	It is easy to do ,
55783	1	a	you just control the
55784	0	a	According to the distance .
55785	0	a	According to your distance to and the angle maybe , if you have a stereo system .
55786	0	a	Distance .
55787	0	a	Yeah
55788	0	a	yeah
55789	0	a	yeah .
55790	0	a	I am not sure about the screen ,
55791	0	a	wha what is the use usefulness of the screen ?
55792	0	a	is it a touch screen by the way ?
55793	0	a	So it gives instructions
55794	0	a	but it has to be with an back light somehow .
55795	0	a	So
55796	0	a	I think it can be just a menu which can be controlled with a left , right , up , down and enter .
55797	0	a	Yeah .
55798	0	a	So ,
55799	0	a	its main purpose in fact is a back light , which change colours ,
55800	0	a	which makes it easier to find ,
55801	0	a	and each can
55802	0	a	it can respond for your voice , like it can turn on the light for you just to f find it easily ,
55803	0	a	yeah ?
55804	0	a	So basically that is it .
55805	0	a	Okay .
55806	0	a	Okay .
55807	0	a	I see that you target several s application not only TV
55808	0	a	but i like we talk about universal remote control .
55809	0	a	Can be easily done , cause you got simple designs ,
55810	0	a	y
55811	1	a	we should put it to simple actions .
55812	0	a	Yeah .
55813	1	a	Let it be universal ,
55814	0	a	so you want to use it for your hi fi system .
55815	0	a	You want to change tracks and you want to adjust volume .
55816	1	a	Just few actions , a few actions for everything .
55817	0	a	S
55818	1	a	All the rest , we sh we will put it into this menu on the screen .
55819	0	a	Since we were targeting a really soon date for the the the i issuing of this remote control
55820	0	a	I think we will only concentrate on TV for the moment
55821	1	a	and then maybe m make it more generalised
55822	1	a	yeah .
55823	0	a	Okay , okay .
55824	0	a	Yeah and it .
55825	0	a	Okay ,
55826	0	a	but it is quite universal you know .
55827	1	a	We can just extend it to any device .
55828	0	a	So
55829	1	a	for instance if I want to go to directly to channel twenty five , how would I do can I do that with this ?
55830	0	a	Yeah let is say I am on channel eight now .
55831	0	a	twenty five .
55832	0	a	You know these days we have hundreds of channels ,
55833	0	a	that is not so easy to go just next next next when you have hundreds of channels .
55834	0	a	In fact I would propose another solution .
55835	0	a	Or is it ?
55836	0	a	Most people
55837	0	a	yeah .
55838	0	a	Basically you use just four or five channels ,
55839	0	a	right ?
55840	0	a	Yeah .
55841	0	a	So
55842	1	a	set up your TV set like channels that you use they are one , two , three and five ,
55843	0	a	and you will never have to go to a twenty fives channel .
55844	0	a	In fact in in one remote control that I have seen , instead of doing that d you could just say these are the cha ch channel three , twenty eight , forty eight and sixty four are those that I want to by cycled with my next button .
55845	0	a	Yeah
55846	0	a	it is it is the same solution , I think .
55847	0	a	I B
55848	0	a	yeah .
55849	0	a	Yeah .
55850	1	a	But even we can have some LCD display , like you can de you can just button the number
55851	1	a	and then it go
55852	0	a	t because
55853	0	a	Yeah .
55854	1	a	Go to channel twenty five .
55855	0	a	One thing is that as I said in my presentation people really do like to z zap .
55856	0	a	So even if they are only watching four or five channels , I think they want to zap out of the one hundred channels , just because this is one kind of thing they do , zapping .
55857	0	a	But still
55858	0	a	Yeah .
55859	0	a	Yeah
55860	0	a	on zap it is only next next next next next , yeah .
55861	0	a	Yeah .
55862	0	a	And it is only next .
55863	0	a	Yeah .
55864	0	a	Yeah
55865	0	a	so but you have to
55866	0	a	Okay .
55867	0	a	We got these buttons here .
55868	0	a	Next next .
55869	0	a	Yeah. .
55870	1	a	Or say this can be back .
55871	0	a	Yeah .
55872	1	a	But otherwise like we can put some display on numbers and then they can just press suppose two five they just press two and five
55873	0	a	and then
55874	0	a	Yeah .
55875	0	a	So it would be
55876	0	a	Okay .
55877	1	a	Maybe we can make different modes for each button and you can change mode zapping mode or current chan
55878	0	a	Yeah .
55879	0	a	Yeah .
55880	0	a	Yeah ,
55881	0	a	yeah .
55882	0	a	Alright .
55883	0	a	Yeah ,
55884	0	a	yeah .
55885	0	a	Yeah
55886	0	a	but since we are focusing only on TV remote controls
55887	1	a	so we can have more functions for TV if you want to go for a universal
55888	1	a	then we ought to limit for functions for each of our devices .
55889	0	a	Listening more .
55890	0	a	Okay .
55891	0	a	Could we carry out some research if we w really need this ,
55892	0	a	like how many people really need to go to channel number twenty five and then to sixty four ?
55893	0	a	Okay .
55894	0	a	Well
55895	0	a	I could could have a look at that maybe .
55896	0	a	Yeah .
55897	0	a	Yeah .
55898	1	a	I will check in my department if there is someone specialist in that .
55899	0	a	Okay .
55900	0	a	Although I do not know .
55901	0	a	Okay .
55902	0	a	Alright ?
55903	0	a	Thanks for your attention .
55904	0	a	you are finish ?
55905	0	a	Okay .
55906	1	a	So now the technical aspects of this new device .
55907	0	a	Two .
55908	0	a	Yeah ,
55909	0	a	if
55910	0	a	Sorry .
55911	0	a	You prefer it .
55912	0	a	Yeah .
55913	0	a	as you know , I am mister Ramaro .
55914	0	a	I am an expert in industrial design of all electronic devices and I previously devised many like digital calculators and electronic calculators .
55915	1	a	So now I will briefly describe the working design of our remote control .
55916	0	a	Well ,
55917	0	a	as you know the basic function of remote control is sending some message to the the device , like TV or VCR or DVD player etcetera .
55918	0	a	So we will have a p portable device which will send message to the the main device like TV .
55919	0	a	So we need to have some energy source to do what to do the functions , what we want on this portable device .
55920	0	a	And usually this
55921	0	a	so to do these functions we need an interface , which basically some kind of pressing buttons or keys or like moving jack or something like that .
55922	0	a	And then these messages these key buttons can be transferred into some kind of message and then it will process by the chip and then it will generate some information to the main device .
55923	0	a	It is generally in the form of infrared or some kind of s sensor information .
55924	0	a	Then we will have the main control in the main device to do the particular action what we want .
55925	0	a	So ,
55926	0	a	basically we need
55927	0	a	since we are focusing on our interface device remote control mainly the energy source like the battery and then we have user interface like the keypad and you know buttons we want , and then we have some chip , it is mainly digital signal processing chip because since we are I am one doing mostly digital devices
55928	1	a	we ought to have some kind of processor which take care of all these functions and put it in some digital format .
55929	0	a	And then we will have the infrared LED source which sends the information to the main device .
55930	0	a	Then we will have switch in our main device to do particular operations ,
55931	1	a	and we ought to do different codes for different TVs ,
55932	0	a	so some TVs will have different encryption codes for doing s s channel changing and these things .
55933	0	a	Okay .
55934	0	a	To make it quite an universal device .
55935	0	a	Yeah yeah ,
55936	0	a	because the people do not use one particular brand so
55937	1	a	or at least we have more more than five brands , which are really good .
55938	0	a	Okay .
55939	1	a	So we need to check their specifications and do their encryption
55940	0	a	that is passing information to the TV device .
55941	1	a	So we need to have particular encryption codes .
55942	0	a	Okay .
55943	1	a	Then , components ,
55944	1	a	so we have the main energy source and then we will have some buttons and then we will have infrared source and then we have some inside some chip in in the device .
55945	0	a	since I do not have much time
55946	1	a	so I will input the connections to all this components .
55947	0	a	And since I also want to know feedback from our Marketing Expert and User Interface ,
55948	1	a	so if you want to add some more components we can incorporate them .
55949	1	a	And from from the discussion we had do you can you make it on the whiteboard , or .
55950	0	a	Yeah .
55951	0	a	Yeah , I am sure ,
55952	0	a	because since our User Interface speech recognition and also Marketing Expert for the speech recognition is really handy ,
55953	0	a	so
55954	1	a	we can have another , like s simple speech recogniser on our DSB chip .
55955	0	a	Since we have some kind of energy this is our this normal battery , so this battery , once you s switch on it will take power
55956	1	a	and we can have some speech recognition and in our g generally small digital signal processing chip
55957	1	a	so that
55958	1	a	and we will put the small simple speech recogniser
55959	1	a	and we can also train the speech recogniser for particular user
55960	0	a	so you just
55961	0	a	yeah ,
55962	0	a	so that we just use simple recog
55963	0	a	no
55964	0	a	but but
55965	0	a	Yeah .
55966	0	a	On
55967	0	a	train it , okay .
55968	0	a	Too complex .
55969	0	a	But very very good to sell .
55970	0	a	No ,
55971	0	a	even in
55972	0	a	you can find even simple mobile device like any mobile brand you can have these voice dialers or these things , yeah .
55973	0	a	Think of a all these young people who would love to say that this remote control only works for them , and ha ha you cannot use my remote control , because it is targeted to me .
55974	0	a	Okay .
55975	0	a	Okay .
55976	0	a	Yeah .
55977	0	a	Yeah .
55978	0	a	Whatever .
55979	0	a	And what about the price of this component ?
55980	0	a	It
55981	0	a	okay .
55982	0	a	So
55983	0	a	maybe we can make it in five Euros and even less than that , because we want to have millions and in bulk ,
55984	0	a	so we can make really simp
55985	1	a	and we want to make really simple device
55986	0	a	because we have only very few words like like power , switch on or some like
55987	1	a	then we will have something like this we will have volume and then we will have s particular channel ,
55988	0	a	so users can listen .
55989	0	a	Cheap .
55990	0	a	Millions .
55991	0	a	Okay .
55992	0	a	Cheap .
55993	0	a	The user will just be able to say please can you pump up the vo pump up the volume or or it will be something like volume , up , down .
55994	0	a	No , yeah ,
55995	0	a	a user can use any kind of sender
55996	1	a	but they should have this prompt volume and then
55997	0	a	yeah
55998	1	a	volume and decrease or increase , so we try to only recognise those words and and because we ca not really say user to say same wording
55999	0	a	then it become more mechanical and
56000	0	a	yeah .
56001	0	a	Okay .
56002	1	a	With a keywords and yeah .
56003	0	a	Okay .
56004	0	a	Couple of words .
56005	0	a	Okay .
56006	0	a	Okay .
56007	1	a	And then we can have channel they can say ,
56008	1	a	okay I want eight ,
56009	0	a	because we do not know like users have different programmes , I mean they do not really follow same channels strict
56010	1	a	so we just want channel number , we do not want like BBC or CNN or something else
56011	0	a	because it will be complicated
56012	1	a	so we will have only these three main basic
56013	0	a	anyway volume is not really speech recognition problem ,
56014	0	a	it is it it will be take care of our main .
56015	0	a	Of course it has to be
56016	0	a	Okay .
56017	0	a	Okay .
56018	0	a	Okay .
56019	0	a	No you know
56020	0	a	it is a conceptual question , cause now I see th this the picture in front of my eyes like a user taking his remote control and shouting into it , volume up , volume up ,
56021	0	a	and and he is coming
56022	0	a	you know , he is really annoyed with this , down , up , down .
56023	0	a	But then I think you you
56024	1	a	First of all I
56025	1	a	I think this is not functionality that it is going to be instead of using the buttons .
56026	0	a	No , in no not only speech , yeah .
56027	0	a	It is on top of using the button .
56028	0	a	Okay ,
56029	0	a	for this budget like twelve Euros .
56030	0	a	I it is an option .
56031	0	a	Well ,
56032	0	a	I dunno .
56033	0	a	Yeah
56034	1	a	actually we we can have one switch to like switch on , on and off , this processor
56035	0	a	and This really ,
56036	0	a	suppose like here we have our main chip which controls power , volume and this part and this DSPs .
56037	0	a	Again , this to have some interaction like suppose people use DSP then it particularly sends some information to the chip like in some form , like volume and like this key .
56038	0	a	So it may not be like very expensive ,
56039	0	a	because since we are only focusing on TV remote control
56040	0	a	so
56041	0	a	and we have only few things here
56042	0	a	Yeah .
56043	0	a	Okay. .
56044	0	a	TV .
56045	0	a	Okay .
56046	0	a	Sho to to train , okay .
56047	0	a	Did you consider the r gest gesture recognition ?
56048	1	a	Like , if I want to put volume up
56049	1	a	I like do I take my remote control
56050	1	a	do like something like roll them up or roll them down .
56051	0	a	this point we did not consider
56052	0	a	because it is it is very expensive
56053	0	a	because v our target is only like twelve point five Euros
56054	0	a	and
56055	0	a	Yeah ,
56056	0	a	even automatic on off is also a bit problematic ,
56057	0	a	because it different criteria for different people like so suppose people are really they just they do not touch the remote and
56058	0	a	y you do not know how much time you need to switch on or switch off
56059	0	a	and
56060	0	a	Yay yeah .
56061	0	a	Very expensive ,
56062	0	a	no ?
56063	0	a	And volume control .
56064	0	a	And well ,
56065	0	a	what about the idea of automatic on off on the button ,
56066	0	a	yeah .
56067	0	a	why ?
56068	0	a	That is just
56069	0	a	We got a really good Market Expert .
56070	0	a	So but
56071	0	a	Sh should we target a a user personalised remote control ?
56072	0	a	So in in a given room there might be more than one remote control .
56073	1	a	We would have each one and with our own personal settings .
56074	0	a	Yeah that can be possible , especially for power settings ,
56075	0	a	so user can say okay , suppose they are watching a tennis match or something then they can say okay after one hour
56076	0	a	I
56077	0	a	They can make
56078	0	a	Yeah we can have
56079	0	a	Yeah .
56080	0	a	Would not that make arguments ?
56081	0	a	I want And we can increase this the strength
56082	0	a	y you can buy one with
56083	0	a	Yeah , of course .
56084	0	a	That is no problem , we will sell more .
56085	0	a	Yeah exactly .
56086	0	a	Let is send more , let is sell more .
56087	0	a	Okay .
56088	0	a	Okay .
56089	0	a	You have something else to say ? .
56090	0	a	, not very much ,
56091	0	a	like yeah .
56092	0	a	No .
56093	0	a	Okay .
56094	0	a	Thanks .
56095	0	a	Okay ,
56096	0	a	thanks .
56097	0	a	Thank you .
56098	0	a	Yep .
56099	0	a	Thank you .
56100	0	a	So
56101	0	a	I think , okay , we are just on time .
56102	1	a	Can you just
56103	0	a	yeah .
56104	0	a	So ,
56105	1	a	we are now going to l have the lunch break .
56106	0	a	great .
56107	1	a	Then we will work again for thirty minutes individual work , and we will meet again for the next meeting ,
56108	0	a	and in this one want to to be more focused on the individual actions the on the components
56109	0	a	so
56110	1	a	you will focus on the component concept of course the UID Mark will be focused on the user interface concept and our m Market Expert Sammy Benjo on the trend watching .
56111	0	a	Yeah yeah .
56112	0	a	Mark will
56113	0	a	it is in current price , yeah .
56114	0	a	So
56115	0	a	of course like before specific instruction will be sent to you by your personal personal coach .
56116	0	a	Well
56117	0	a	I think that is all .
56118	1	a	And we have maybe we have to we say , only for TV , not
56119	1	a	teletext ?
56120	0	a	I think automatic on off control it is not possible .
56121	0	a	Difficult .
56122	0	a	Yeah ,
56123	1	a	maybe in the next step if we make it work .
56124	0	a	Yeah .
56125	0	a	But speech recogniser can be possible .
56126	0	a	Yeah , implemented .
56127	0	a	O okay ,
56128	1	a	we can think about that .
56129	0	a	And
56130	0	a	do you see something else ?
56131	0	a	yeah
56132	0	a	that is
56133	1	a	Or maybe you want to phone him .
56134	0	a	No .
56135	0	a	, should it be equipped with the , with speakers ?
56136	1	a	Like , you want to find it , you shout control , and it answers is I am here ?
56137	1	a	Or
56138	0	a	Just beeps ?
56139	0	a	I ca not whistle .
56140	0	a	Speakers in the remote cont
56141	0	a	Oh yeah .
56142	1	a	It just beeps .
56143	0	a	That would be enough .
56144	1	a	Something very cheap .
56145	0	a	But that is ex that is expensive .
56146	0	a	Yeah
56147	0	a	yeah
56148	0	a	yeah .
56149	0	a	Since now all
56150	0	a	yeah ?
56151	0	a	Think
56152	0	a	Uh huh .
56153	0	a	Yeah ,
56154	0	a	especially the power , it really consumes because it should be all the time on
56155	0	a	and
56156	0	a	Yeah .
56157	0	a	Well
56158	0	a	I I heard of devices where you just whistle them
56159	0	a	and and they
56160	0	a	because of the the frequency they they just answer to that .
56161	0	a	And
56162	0	a	And it is answered .
56163	0	a	Yeah .
56164	0	a	No , no , I ca not .
56165	0	a	You ca not whistle .
56166	0	a	Uh huh .
56167	1	a	Or a clap .
56168	0	a	Clap clap clap
56169	0	a	it is a good
56170	0	a	I I think it is universal .
56171	0	a	You can clap .
56172	0	a	Can you ?
56173	0	a	Clap is good .
56174	0	a	Yeah .
56175	0	a	Yeah .
56176	0	a	Tak
56177	0	a	Just a suggestion .
56178	0	a	What about people without hand ?
56179	0	a	Yeah .
56180	0	a	Okay .
56181	0	a	With only one hand ?
56182	0	a	These are not our target people .
56183	0	a	Yeah I think it is good .
56184	0	a	okay .
56185	0	a	But it is a good feature
56186	0	a	I guess yeah
56187	1	a	we need to think about more how to incorporate it .
56188	0	a	Okay .
56189	1	a	Just do not interfere with other devices like
56190	0	a	cause like all these people do that their lights are turning on with clapping .
56191	0	a	Oh
56192	0	a	that is e that already exists
56193	0	a	okay okay .
56194	0	a	Oh .
56195	0	a	Yeah , I got it at my home , like .
56196	0	a	Oh yeah , you do have .
56197	0	a	Wow .
56198	0	a	it is
56199	0	a	Yeah .
56200	0	a	You are trendy .
56201	0	a	, so
56202	1	a	let is to think
56203	0	a	s so that
56204	0	a	yeah .
56205	1	a	Think about it .
56206	0	a	Yeah , okay .
56207	1	a	I think that could be in the component concept .
56208	0	a	It yes .
56209	0	a	Okay .
56210	0	a	Okay .
56211	0	a	Good
56212	0	a	we are done ?
56213	0	a	Right ,
56214	0	a	So ,
56215	0	a	yeah ,
56216	0	a	Yeah .
56217	0	a	 
56218	0	a	Okay , so
56219	0	a	now we are on the conceptual design meeting .
56220	0	a	y getting close to the last is the penultim meeting .
56221	0	a	How was lunch ?
56222	0	a	great .
56223	0	a	Thanks Do not be sarcastic .
56224	0	a	Mark .
56225	0	a	So
56226	0	a	I will again do the secretary part we will have three presentation first the industrial design , first Rama then Mark and then Sammy .
56227	0	a	Rama .
56228	0	a	Ramaro .
56229	0	a	we have to take a decision on the control remote control concepts and we have forty minutes .
56230	0	a	So
56231	0	a	what we want to
56232	0	a	the decision we want to take on this meeting are on the first on the component concept , so what kind of energy we use what kind of chip on print and one ki kind of case .
56233	0	a	And also on user interface concept what kind of interface we use and if there is some supplements .
56234	0	a	And at the end Sammy will give a trend watching on what he is he is been doing .
56235	0	a	It is
56236	0	a	So ,
56237	1	a	let is go .
56238	1	a	First with Rama .
56239	0	a	Participant two .
56240	0	a	Yeah , participant two .
56241	1	a	Component .
56242	0	a	Yep .
56243	0	a	So
56244	0	a	we are to mainly design f mainly need to know which components we will use for energy , and the material and interface .
56245	0	a	For energy there are maybe two or three possibilities .
56246	0	a	First one , we can use simple battery , or we can use traditional solar cells
56247	0	a	or
56248	0	a	and the material we can have plastic , rubber which is good for this RSA
56249	0	a	and then titanium , which can be which have very good look
56250	0	a	an and then interface we are to use push buttons or liquid crystal
56251	0	a	d LCD display .
56252	0	a	And we can use some , moving kind of thing .
56253	0	a	So ,
56254	0	a	as we discussed before ,
56255	0	a	we need to
56256	0	a	we would like to have some speech recognition s chip in our remote control .
56257	0	a	So
56258	1	a	this can be simple kind of programmable chip
56259	0	a	and
56260	1	a	which can use microphone sensors .
56261	0	a	And we also want to look at our remote control ,
56262	0	a	so .
56263	1	a	Still we are looking for possible technical specifications and how w easy we can do and within our pri range , like we are to in our twelve Euros or around that .
56264	1	a	So we are looking for simple devices or simple technology to do the location of remote control in a room or in a house .
56265	0	a	, okay .
56266	0	a	So
56267	0	a	we discussed an
56268	0	a	Excuse me .
56269	0	a	So
56270	1	a	we would like to propose battery instead of solar cells
56271	0	a	and it would be problematic to have enough energy with the solar cells
56272	1	a	and so we would like to just use simple battery .
56273	1	a	And also we want to go for titanium design instead of rubber or
56274	0	a	and
56275	0	a	well
56276	0	a	the problem is with this design we found that we ca not use double curved shapes .
56277	0	a	What is a double curved shape ?
56278	0	a	Uh huh .
56279	0	a	Like you can have two curves .
56280	0	a	Why ?
56281	0	a	it is I think in manufacturing
56282	0	a	I guess it is problematic .
56283	0	a	So ,
56284	1	a	we want to go for simple push buttons
56285	0	a	because it need a simple chip and it is really lesser re really less expensive compared to LCD
56286	0	a	which are
56287	0	a	which needs advanced chip technology and it is more expensive , since we want to put some other features such as speech recognition
56288	1	a	we want to reduce cost .
56289	0	a	The cost .
56290	0	a	I want to know why it b just sorry but for the point before why not the rubber , if it is something that it seems to be light .
56291	0	a	And also like in if you put a it is be difficult to do all the moulding of buttons and these things
56292	0	a	and
56293	0	a	Yeah .
56294	0	a	Okay .
56295	0	a	You m titanium it is more
56296	0	a	Yes
56297	0	a	so Uh huh .
56298	1	a	W we can use something like you know the whole body is titanium but there are some rubber or
56299	1	a	I dunno some rubber parts
56300	0	a	like
56301	0	a	to make it feel better
56302	0	a	and to
56303	0	a	you know
56304	0	a	Yeah .
56305	0	a	like this ?
56306	0	a	Yeah .
56307	0	a	Like in cell phones recently
56308	0	a	these you can with the rubber in four directions and
56309	0	a	yeah .
56310	0	a	Yeah .
56311	0	a	Okay .
56312	1	a	But full assembly We will use mainly for titanium
56313	0	a	rubber is expensive and also it is bit difficult to do all the shapes .
56314	0	a	Okay .
56315	0	a	Okay .
56316	0	a	Okay .
56317	0	a	And this push buttons
56318	1	a	we we would like to use push buttons instead of LCDs
56319	0	a	and so we want to mo
56320	0	a	I mean we are we want to put speech recognition
56321	1	a	so we want to reduce price on this technology
56322	0	a	and so that we can have enough space or enough money
56323	0	a	for S S
56324	0	a	Y
56325	0	a	yeah
56326	0	a	we have simple buttons and speech recognition technology ,
56327	0	a	so l
56328	0	a	So
56329	0	a	it is like a
56330	0	a	Yeah
56331	0	a	maybe maybe we can see depending on how we will come up with our full design
56332	0	a	then if we have enough money or like for and
56333	0	a	because the speech recognition technology will take at least five Euros or or something
56334	1	a	so we want to reduce the cost on display
56335	0	a	or this inter
56336	0	a	Ok Yeah , that can we we can consider ,
56337	0	a	because like it wo not take much money I guess ,
56338	0	a	because
56339	0	a	Okay , yep .
56340	0	a	yeah
56341	0	a	so
56342	0	a	Okay , s so
56343	0	a	simple button and speech recognition for the more complicated .
56344	0	a	Speech
56345	0	a	LCD .
56346	0	a	Okay .
56347	0	a	Okay ,
56348	0	a	and still we have
56349	0	a	can we still include the L LSD display ?
56350	0	a	LCD
56351	0	a	yeah
56352	0	a	LCD .
56353	0	a	Seems not ,
56354	0	a	it is either LCD or push button .
56355	0	a	No ,
56356	1	a	it is not going to be a t no touchable but still like a source of information or source for menus .
56357	0	a	Okay ,
56358	1	a	so let is try it ,
56359	0	a	let is t
56360	0	a	Yeah , yeah ,
56361	1	a	it is it is not going to be a touch pad , just a display for giving you information .
56362	0	a	The LCD would
56363	0	a	The display would only be display and not touch sensitive you mean .
56364	0	a	Just for output ,
56365	0	a	yeah .
56366	0	a	Yeah .
56367	0	a	Okay .
56368	0	a	You have any further questions
56369	0	a	or ?
56370	0	a	Yeah .
56371	0	a	I guess no
56372	0	a	So
56373	0	a	the batteries are going to be very light .
56374	0	a	Yeah ,
56375	0	a	we are to go for li
56376	0	a	and now I think we have many options in the market
56377	0	a	so we can go for small nickel or alkaline batteries for really light batteries and with good price .
56378	0	a	Okay .
56379	0	a	So
56380	1	a	this device on n that can be used for speech recognition could also be used for just the finding it basically , instead of clapping why not just be ask .
56381	0	a	Yeah ,
56382	0	a	that is
56383	1	a	then the the one thing we want to know is like
56384	0	a	because remote control is used for like in the household
56385	0	a	so it
56386	0	a	it
56387	0	a	it will be it m maybe
56388	0	a	at least five , six people want to use it
56389	1	a	so so how to how to define our re speech recognition
56390	0	a	whether we want to do s speaker independent or speaker dependent .
56391	0	a	If we are going for more speaker independent then it would be like again cumbersome
56392	0	a	and we need really m more technology
56393	0	a	and so
56394	0	a	Yeah ,
56395	1	a	if if everybody in the house n to locate then we are to go for some speaker independent technology or something .
56396	0	a	Okay ,
56397	0	a	for the location .
56398	0	a	Okay .
56399	0	a	Okay .
56400	0	a	So
56401	0	a	let is now go to the
56402	0	a	you do not have more question ?
56403	0	a	thank you .
56404	0	a	No , it is okay .
56405	0	a	No more questions .
56406	0	a	Yep .
56407	0	a	Thank you .
56408	0	a	Puts less of constraint on what we can do
56409	0	a	but
56410	0	a	it is always like that .
56411	0	a	yeah ,
56412	0	a	yeah .
56413	0	a	Yeah .
56414	0	a	Yeah .
56415	0	a	We have dreams and the in the end
56416	0	a	we find out that it is not feasible .
56417	0	a	Yeah ,
56418	0	a	but .
56419	0	a	Oh .
56420	1	a	Anyway .
56421	0	a	We have some limitations .
56422	0	a	Yeah .
56423	0	a	But still LSD is already quite nice ,
56424	0	a	LC
56425	0	a	I am an artist ,
56426	0	a	sorry .
56427	0	a	LCD .
56428	0	a	LSD is something else ,
56429	0	a	and it is quite nice as well .
56430	0	a	Okay .
56431	0	a	So ,
56432	1	a	go on artist .
56433	0	a	So ,
56434	0	a	that is not
56435	0	a	I hope that is not too much .
56436	0	a	yeah .
56437	1	a	Now let is talk about interface .
56438	0	a	Okay .
56439	0	a	participant number three .
56440	0	a	Three .
56441	0	a	Three .
56442	1	a	have a look at this
56443	0	a	no it is
56444	0	a	yeah .
56445	0	a	Which one ?
56446	0	a	Okay .
56447	0	a	so
56448	1	a	the concept of the interface .
56449	0	a	Generally I developed quite a broad concept not only for the interface , but for possible instruction or user is manual and all the complex things that come together with your TV and remote controls .
56450	1	a	So let is start with this .
56451	0	a	We got our perfect remote control with a lot of buttons
56452	0	a	and we got explanation for every button
56453	0	a	and you can use your time
56454	0	a	and it will take i some days to learn all this buttons
56455	1	a	and the LCD is going to be somewhere here
56456	0	a	and go back button
56457	0	a	, I do not know really where it is , maybe one of this buttons , and power on and off I
56458	0	a	I do not remember
56459	0	a	so
56460	0	a	it it it should be
56461	0	a	maybe this button is power on and off ?
56462	0	a	Or no ?
56463	0	a	I can see nothing .
56464	0	a	So
56465	0	a	that is our concept .
56466	0	a	It is called the millennium remote control .
56467	0	a	Let is change millenniums .
56468	0	a	Yeah .
56469	0	a	So
56470	0	a	maybe you can use in the end and
56471	0	a	does not make sense .
56472	0	a	This is very ugly .
56473	0	a	Really ?
56474	0	a	I thought you like it .
56475	0	a	Oh no , too much concept .
56476	0	a	okay
56477	1	a	just press the button , please .
56478	0	a	No .
56479	0	a	Yeah ,
56480	1	a	we will not use this .
56481	1	a	We will not use this .
56482	1	a	But instead of this I will devise That is our concept .
56483	0	a	back today .
56484	0	a	And it is got just few buttons , quite low looking , and all this stuff we already we already discussed .
56485	0	a	Kay .
56486	0	a	And what will people say ?
56487	0	a	They will say it is perfect .
56488	0	a	Or what will say ?
56489	0	a	they will say it is splendid .
56490	0	a	And e everyone will say I will buy it .
56491	0	a	And everyone is going to be satisfied .
56492	0	a	Do you think it can come in several colours ?
56493	0	a	Or did the
56494	0	a	but not the case .
56495	1	a	I would make a backlight of the LCD screen with different colours .
56496	0	a	Not the case .
56497	0	a	the case would only be in that aluminium titanium stuff ,
56498	0	a	like
56499	0	a	Yeah ,
56500	0	a	well
56501	0	a	they like something which is
56502	0	a	yeah ,
56503	0	a	okay ,
56504	1	a	so that would be the option
56505	0	a	Yeah .
56506	0	a	Because apparently from your survey people like colours ,
56507	0	a	no ?
56508	0	a	Okay .
56509	0	a	Yeah .
56510	0	a	Okay , so
56511	0	a	let is remember there is a Nokia phone which changeable panels .
56512	0	a	Do you like it ?
56513	0	a	That is why you do not have it .
56514	0	a	I do not know
56515	0	a	I do not have a Nokia phone ,
56516	0	a	but
56517	0	a	I do not use that but again , I might
56518	0	a	Yeah ,
56519	0	a	bu but
56520	0	a	But it is
56521	0	a	But it would be expensive , no ?
56522	0	a	If you use colour LCD .
56523	0	a	That is why ,
56524	0	a	cause it is nasty .
56525	0	a	No .
56526	1	a	instead of that maybe we can change the colour of the assembler .
56527	0	a	Maybe we can just
56528	1	a	if users want more colours they can pay more money to get this the shapes and they can have different assembly .
56529	0	a	, I am here .
56530	0	a	So users have different
56531	0	a	I mean they have their own interests , colour interests and so
56532	0	a	So we can just
56533	1	a	if they want they can just pay another two Euro .
56534	0	a	So ?
56535	0	a	Uh huh , okay ,
56536	0	a	so
56537	0	a	you you propose something with option i that increase the price if we if you want o more colours on LCD ,
56538	0	a	yeah .
56539	0	a	Kay .
56540	0	a	Yeah .
56541	0	a	Yeah
56542	0	a	yeah yes .
56543	0	a	If they want like so that we can
56544	0	a	yeah .
56545	1	a	Kind of upgradable remote control .
56546	0	a	Yeah .
56547	0	a	Wow , wow .
56548	0	a	Okay .
56549	1	a	Just they will get few more things and few more colours .
56550	0	a	Okay ,
56551	0	a	what
56552	1	a	there is one more decisi one more solution in fact ,
56553	0	a	cause there are some some paints that can change colour according to where they are , like they can reflect different colours depending on what is around , like what colour is around , and depending on the temperature ,
56554	0	a	yeah .
56555	0	a	Lights , yeah .
56556	0	a	And thermodynamic also .
56557	0	a	Yeah .
56558	0	a	Like a chameleon .
56559	0	a	Yeah yeah .
56560	1	a	We can make it in fact .
56561	0	a	Yeah
56562	0	a	but that is maybe mo too much expensive , yeah .
56563	0	a	If if if the
56564	0	a	okay .
56565	1	a	But it can be in maybe in an a gradable version ,
56566	0	a	but
56567	0	a	so
56568	0	a	Uh huh .
56569	0	a	Yeah .
56570	0	a	Because I think there are two kinds of people .
56571	0	a	Those for which the remote control is is to be something useful
56572	1	a	I am going to talk about this later
56573	0	a	but
56574	0	a	and those for which is something that that that is specific to them
56575	0	a	so it it is like a signature .
56576	0	a	My remote control is pink .
56577	0	a	Nobody else than me has a pink remote control .
56578	0	a	And that makes me special .
56579	0	a	Okay
56580	0	a	and you think that we do not have to make to make them pay more
56581	0	a	because of o or this is
56582	0	a	Okay ,
56583	0	a	so so
56584	0	a	i
56585	0	a	it is not a s base service
56586	0	a	it is a
56587	0	a	I think I think they would be ready p ready to pay more for that .
56588	0	a	Those who wanted to have it pink .
56589	0	a	No no .
56590	0	a	So ,
56591	1	a	be an option ,
56592	0	a	yeah .
56593	0	a	It might be optional , yeah .
56594	0	a	Okay .
56595	0	a	But those people will be really few ,
56596	0	a	no ?
56597	0	a	So like
56598	0	a	we can those
56599	0	a	The the young people the young people want to be different from their friends .
56600	0	a	Although similar but have something just slightly better .
56601	0	a	Yeah .
56602	0	a	Pink
56603	0	a	So m so
56604	1	a	maybe that is if that it is a selling point
56605	1	a	maybe it has to be the base .
56606	0	a	Yeah , yeah ,
56607	0	a	yeah .
56608	0	a	Yeah .
56609	1	a	But you know if you want to be different you just take your remote control with you all the time .
56610	0	a	And it makes you different ,
56611	0	a	you know ?
56612	0	a	Anyone has their remote controls here ?
56613	0	a	No ?
56614	0	a	Yeah ,
56615	0	a	yeah .
56616	0	a	And you will be different .
56617	0	a	You always have your remote .
56618	0	a	in the train , hello no .
56619	0	a	Oh , you do not ?
56620	0	a	Yeah .
56621	0	a	You do not have your remo
56622	0	a	Wh
56623	0	a	you you know like
56624	0	a	for instance take the iPod .
56625	0	a	Want to change my neighbour .
56626	0	a	It is a kind of remote control .
56627	0	a	it is white and it is so white that you see it from any anywhere .
56628	0	a	It has this distinctive look and feel and look which people seems to like just because it is a colour that we do not usually see in a remote control .
56629	0	a	Okay .
56630	0	a	White .
56631	0	a	Uh huh , uh huh .
56632	0	a	Could we integrate something into our remote control , something like light ?
56633	1	a	That they can use it in darkness , like .
56634	0	a	Seems important .
56635	1	a	glow in the dark ,
56636	0	a	so
56637	0	a	Okay .
56638	1	a	Hand light ,
56639	0	a	yeah .
56640	0	a	Yeah
56641	1	a	maybe like the infrared like we can put some radium chips or something
56642	0	a	so that like at least
56643	0	a	yeah .
56644	0	a	Iradium ?
56645	0	a	sorry .
56646	0	a	Okay .
56647	0	a	Yeah ,
56648	0	a	that
56649	0	a	Oh .
56650	0	a	Okay .
56651	0	a	Okay .
56652	0	a	Okay .
56653	0	a	S well ,
56654	1	a	let is go on maybe with the presentation .
56655	0	a	So
56656	0	a	Yeah .
56657	0	a	Uh huh , yeah sure .
56658	1	a	And the remote control is going to be smart
56659	1	a	but how smart should it be to not to complicate things too much ?
56660	0	a	And
56661	0	a	I dunno that is a question to you
56662	0	a	and to to
56663	0	a	Well so
56664	0	a	I heard that it seems that speech recognition is something that can be done
56665	1	a	so that is the smartness of the thing .
56666	0	a	Currently we do not have guns with speech recognition or beer cans with speech recognition
56667	1	a	but we may have remote controls with speech recognition .
56668	0	a	Okay , okay .
56669	0	a	I dunno .
56670	0	a	, that is a nice world .
56671	1	a	So just just just just think about it .
56672	0	a	Do not touch the remote .
56673	0	a	Thank you .
56674	0	a	Okay .
56675	0	a	But yeah .
56676	0	a	Are are you saying here that the remote controls should be aware of who is using it ?
56677	0	a	So
56678	0	a	for instance the young guy would not be able to use it because his father does not want .
56679	0	a	yeah
56680	1	a	I just want to say it should be real smart .
56681	0	a	Like with some
56682	1	a	Maybe fingerprint recognition or .
56683	0	a	Voice recognition is quite tough .
56684	1	a	I say do not use it , and the control just looks .
56685	0	a	Yeah .
56686	1	a	Cause I ordered jus To l to l lock it .
56687	0	a	that that could be feasible I guess ,
56688	0	a	like
56689	0	a	So
56690	0	a	since we have we want to do some speaker dependent speech recognition
56691	0	a	so we can use
56692	0	a	yeah .
56693	0	a	Okay .
56694	1	a	So it could be smart in that way .
56695	0	a	Yeah ,
56696	0	a	yeah .
56697	0	a	Okay .
56698	1	a	But for instance th I I am thinking about the other particularity that the the remote control could have .
56699	0	a	S since it it knows who is using it ,
56700	1	a	it might also record the kind of channels you are u more often using and levels of volumes that you are more often things like that and provide you ways of using them , I dunno , somehow ,
56701	0	a	I dunno ,
56702	0	a	that might be expensive
56703	0	a	but
56704	0	a	that might also be a good sales pitch again .
56705	0	a	Yeah .
56706	0	a	Yeah , sure .
56707	0	a	Yeah .
56708	0	a	Yeah .
56709	0	a	it is
56710	1	a	The remote that knows you .
56711	1	a	Okay .
56712	0	a	Okay ,
56713	0	a	thanks .
56714	0	a	So
56715	0	a	it is
56716	0	a	yeah , Marketing Expert .
56717	0	a	My turn ?
56718	0	a	Okay ,
56719	0	a	it is alright .
56720	0	a	Participant two ?
56721	0	a	Four ,
56722	0	a	sorry .
56723	0	a	Four .
56724	0	a	Four , I think .
56725	0	a	Trend ,
56726	0	a	yeah .
56727	0	a	No
56728	1	a	yes .
56729	0	a	Okay , so
56730	1	a	I am going to talk about trends
56731	0	a	and I hope this can help us to to understand l how we should design our remote control .
56732	0	a	So ,
56733	1	a	next slide please .
56734	0	a	So
56735	1	a	first maybe just a small recap on how how do we watch trends
56736	0	a	so
56737	0	a	it is not so simple you might think that it is easy
56738	0	a	but it is not so simple .
56739	0	a	Anyway these days the best source of information is the web as you know , so have to to go often on the web and look at what the others are doing , and ask real people who are using real remote controls every day or any other tool that is similar to a remote control which basically is a small device that people have with them , always , like a phone .
56740	1	a	We can we can use the phone as a as a good example of where to in be inspired .
56741	0	a	Of course those tha d who are watching the trends are also have also to be inspired because in fact they are not only watching the trends
56742	0	a	, they are inventing it , they are creating the trend .
56743	1	a	I hope I am going to try to help you on that .
56744	0	a	This is more risky
56745	0	a	because you are not following the trend , you try to invent it , which means either you succeed
56746	0	a	and you make a lot of money
56747	0	a	or you do not
56748	0	a	and you are out of business .
56749	0	a	So anyway
56750	1	a	next slide please .
56751	1	a	to be to be quick
56752	0	a	there is a lot of words here
56753	1	a	but basically there are in in the market of of remote controls
56754	1	a	there are three aspects that we should very pay much attention to .
56755	0	a	The first one , which seems to be the most important one , is that it has to be fancy , it has to have a fancy look and feel .
56756	0	a	And interestingly this is the very most important thing .
56757	0	a	It has to be fancy .
56758	0	a	Strangely enough it is more important to be fancy than to be wi and now that is the second thing it has to be , it has to be technologically i innovative
56759	0	a	, it has to be new with some of new technology inside and
56760	0	a	and this is also more important than the last thing which we w may think that would have been the most important , which is that it should be easy to use and it should be easy to use as a remote control .
56761	0	a	So as you see it first have to be very nice , s something that people are proud of that
56762	0	a	i they can be id identified with
56763	0	a	and and then something that contains very novel stuff that they can talk about with their friends , huh , mine has this and not yours .
56764	0	a	And finally of course it has to be useful as a remote control
56765	0	a	but it seems that it is not so important that it is useful as a remote control .
56766	1	a	Next slide please .
56767	1	a	and now in a more general broad way of seeing th the thing .
56768	0	a	If we look back and not look at only remote controls I think it is important to see that the trends are quite the same in many areas
56769	0	a	so
56770	0	a	currently the the trends that we see in l in l big cities like Paris and Milan , well , it seems that this year things should have a fruit and vegetable way of of look or feel
56771	0	a	or
56772	0	a	so .
56773	0	a	And I think of course
56774	0	a	i
56775	0	a	it applies to everything .
56776	0	a	That is the thing with trends .
56777	0	a	It it can travel f from clothe to furniture same idea .
56778	0	a	Fruit and vegetable .
56779	0	a	Think fruit and vegetable .
56780	0	a	And if we co we compare to last year , now it has to be spongy ,
56781	0	a	yeah .
56782	0	a	What is spongy ?
56783	0	a	Okay .
56784	0	a	Well
56785	0	a	this
56786	0	a	so so I think i
56787	0	a	When we were talking about rubber ,
56788	1	a	I think the rubber aspect might be important
56789	0	a	because it is what is probably more feasible in terms of sponginess .
56790	0	a	Yeah
56791	0	a	kind of maybe
56792	0	a	Yeah
56793	0	a	it
56794	0	a	Yeah .
56795	0	a	S
56796	0	a	So maybe titanium it is not a good idea .
56797	0	a	Yeah .
56798	0	a	Seems not , seems not .
56799	1	a	We need to think about .
56800	0	a	Yeah .
56801	0	a	So
56802	0	a	Think more of something in the colours of like fruit and vegetables and spongy ,
56803	0	a	as a
56804	0	a	even in the shape it has to be more round and more look natural somehow .
56805	0	a	sorry Mark .
56806	0	a	It seems to be
56807	0	a	Mm mm .
56808	0	a	Fruit .
56809	0	a	Even shape ?
56810	0	a	More
56811	0	a	yeah .
56812	0	a	Yeah .
56813	0	a	I mean And not those futuristic remote control with angles and and titanium like .
56814	0	a	So
56815	0	a	that is what people seem to
56816	0	a	yeah
56817	0	a	i
56818	0	a	I know it is quite far from what you thought
56819	0	a	but that is that is fashion
56820	0	a	and
56821	0	a	Okay
56822	0	a	that is all I have to say .
56823	0	a	You are old fashioned .
56824	0	a	Sorry .
56825	0	a	Okay .
56826	0	a	you have questions ?
56827	0	a	So
56828	0	a	these abilities are mainly ad addressed by young people ?
56829	0	a	Or it is This you
56830	0	a	you so did you
56831	0	a	Where ?
56832	0	a	Oh .
56833	0	a	These I am sorry .
56834	0	a	Yeah , yeah
56835	0	a	we have people listening to the trends everywhere in the world , of course , as you know our company is quite big
56836	0	a	and so I am just asking them what are the current trends according to them when they go in the stores and when they ask their friends
56837	0	a	that are also
56838	0	a	well .
56839	0	a	Oh ,
56840	0	a	okay , .
56841	0	a	It is not from
56842	0	a	Yeah .
56843	0	a	Yeah .
56844	0	a	It is more general trend it is not particular to the remote control .
56845	0	a	No , it is not it is not this
56846	0	a	this is very general , yeah .
56847	0	a	But it seems that trends travel across things .
56848	0	a	Yeah .
56849	0	a	The what we
56850	0	a	Sure .
56851	0	a	Yeah
56852	0	a	but some materials n they are to be they are to be something like solid like they ca not be really spongy
56853	0	a	or
56854	0	a	yeah yeah .
56855	0	a	Yeah .
56856	1	a	We have to I think we have to have the look of fruit and vegetables
56857	0	a	but we still have to put our chips inside , so of course .
56858	0	a	yeah , yeah
56859	1	a	sponge ,
56860	0	a	yeah yeah
56861	0	a	at least that is
56862	0	a	Yeah yeah
56863	0	a	that
56864	0	a	yeah yeah .
56865	0	a	This is your problem .
56866	0	a	This is not mine .
56867	0	a	Yeah .
56868	0	a	Yeah ,
56869	0	a	looking
56870	0	a	yeah
56871	0	a	fruit .
56872	0	a	These things can be easily incorporated .
56873	1	a	We can have t colours or this shape
56874	0	a	or at least
56875	0	a	Yeah ,
56876	1	a	I think in the colours and in the the kind of material .
56877	0	a	If if it is something like rubber made or I think it it is also going to be good .
56878	0	a	Yeah .
56879	0	a	Okay ?
56880	0	a	Yep .
56881	0	a	Yeah .
56882	0	a	Okay .
56883	0	a	No more question ?
56884	0	a	Okay .
56885	0	a	Thanks .
56886	0	a	So .
56887	0	a	Okay , so
56888	0	a	we will have next meeting in thirty minutes again .
56889	1	a	now you have to go straight on this individual action
56890	0	a	which i which are for Rama wil design , Mark the user interface design , and Sammy the product evaluation .
56891	0	a	Look and feel de
56892	0	a	you will work together on a new on on a prototype using modelling clay .
56893	0	a	sounds interesting .
56894	0	a	and I as always your personal coach will send you specific instruction .
56895	0	a	Okay .
56896	0	a	Okay .
56897	0	a	Thanks .
56898	0	a	So ,
56899	0	a	can we highlight the specific features of our
56900	0	a	yeah ,
56901	0	a	so so
56902	0	a	we want the speech recogniser and we want some kind of buttons and we want some themes like fruits or vegetables ,
56903	0	a	that is
56904	0	a	we want to follow general trend .
56905	0	a	Yeah you are right , you have to
56906	0	a	So
56907	0	a	you say s S
56908	0	a	do we agree on that ?
56909	0	a	Yeah .
56910	0	a	Spongy .
56911	0	a	Yeah .
56912	0	a	We have to .
56913	0	a	So ,
56914	0	a	do you think
56915	0	a	So
56916	0	a	we have to
56917	0	a	for
56918	0	a	yeah
56919	0	a	so
56920	0	a	are we confident enough on creating trends ?
56921	0	a	Well ,
56922	1	a	we can make it smell like fruit .
56923	0	a	No , we do not have to , but seems it is the trend .
56924	0	a	No .
56925	1	a	Again , as I said we can also try to make it , to create the trend .
56926	0	a	Yeah .
56927	0	a	So there is no
56928	0	a	Well ,
56929	0	a	that is
56930	1	a	you t can try to convince us .
56931	0	a	Yeah .
56932	0	a	Okay .
56933	0	a	Okay , that is a good idea .
56934	0	a	That is
56935	0	a	So
56936	0	a	what about location and these things , people are really interesting on those features ?
56937	0	a	Or they really like They more want these fancy features
56938	0	a	like
56939	0	a	Feature
56940	0	a	Yeah .
56941	0	a	that is a good idea ,
56942	0	a	I
56943	0	a	I think i
56944	0	a	yeah
56945	0	a	i it is again in this
56946	0	a	what I said first it has to be fancy
56947	0	a	so I think if nobody else pro provides currently a remote control with that kind of stuff and if we can provide it
56948	0	a	I think it is a good sell for us
56949	0	a	because we have it and others do not .
56950	0	a	So titanium smell like fruit .
56951	0	a	Yeah .
56952	0	a	Yeah .
56953	0	a	Okay .
56954	0	a	It is fancy .
56955	0	a	Whether it is useful or not does not seem to be very important .
56956	0	a	Yeah .
56957	0	a	I I agree with this
56958	1	a	Now we have to decide on what kind of fanciness .
56959	0	a	Yeah .
56960	0	a	Do we take titanium smelling like fruit , or do we make spongy fruity like
56961	0	a	Yeah .
56962	1	a	we will try to explore these two options
56963	0	a	and
56964	0	a	yeah yeah .
56965	0	a	Maybe you could explore the two option .
56966	0	a	Yeah ,
56967	0	a	yeah .
56968	0	a	Could we make a titanium shape ?
56969	0	a	I mean fruit shaped .
56970	0	a	yeah
56971	1	a	at least like we can make banana
56972	0	a	or
56973	0	a	yeah
56974	0	a	it is it is
56975	0	a	yeah
56976	0	a	that is a
56977	1	a	we are to look for and and s we are to see the whether rubber is expensive
56978	0	a	and d
56979	0	a	Do not you say that you cannot do double shape curved shape
56980	0	a	yeah .
56981	0	a	But
56982	0	a	Doub double curved .
56983	0	a	Seems to be .
56984	0	a	Okay .
56985	0	a	Okay , okay .
56986	0	a	In fact I just agreed to make to make the like titanium panels on a whole rubber body .
56987	0	a	Well , okay
56988	1	a	w we will see .
56989	0	a	Mm mm .
56990	0	a	Okay , so
56991	1	a	you explore now that you are going to work together these these two .
56992	0	a	Yeah We will see .
56993	0	a	Or or spongy an
56994	0	a	yeah .
56995	0	a	Yeah .
56996	1	a	Maybe we can have two different assembly also like one spongy and one kind of titanium .
56997	0	a	we have only the plastic or the the chippy yeah fibre chips or
56998	0	a	If you have time .
56999	0	a	We will see .
57000	0	a	Yeah
57001	0	a	I do not think w
57002	1	a	I think we have to choose .
57003	1	a	If we choose titanium or if we choose spongy but it cannot be both .
57004	0	a	We will see .
57005	0	a	I I really do not like this modelling clay
57006	0	a	cause you know it makes some for for
57007	0	a	I dunno
57008	0	a	yeah
57009	1	a	we will look .
57010	0	a	Yeah .
57011	0	a	For creation .
57012	0	a	Yeah .
57013	0	a	Yeah .
57014	1	a	you can pretend that it is titanium .
57015	0	a	Even design .
57016	1	a	You can paint it afterward .
57017	0	a	Okay , okay .
57018	0	a	No problem .
57019	0	a	We have a very large department of paint .
57020	0	a	Yeah ,
57021	1	a	do do not worry ,
57022	0	a	you you you speak with .
57023	1	a	You will do it .
57024	0	a	Alright , alright .
57025	0	a	Okay .
57026	0	a	So
57027	1	a	explore a shape .
57028	0	a	So
57029	0	a	still we want to keep LCD ?
57030	0	a	Or
57031	0	a	Okay .
57032	0	a	I think it is what we say , that we have an an LCD with information .
57033	0	a	Yeah .
57034	0	a	Not
57035	1	a	The thing is that if we want to have as he says if we want to have a small number of buttons we need to have a kind of output that says currently what their actions are .
57036	0	a	Yeah ,
57037	0	a	then we can
57038	0	a	yeah ,
57039	0	a	yeah ,
57040	1	a	that user friendly
57041	0	a	or
57042	0	a	Yeah .
57043	0	a	That is the converse to having zillions of button where each button does only one thing .
57044	0	a	Yeah .
57045	0	a	Yeah .
57046	0	a	Okay .
57047	0	a	and we just stick with two batteries so it is not any solar or
57048	0	a	yeah
57049	0	a	yeah
57050	0	a	j
57051	0	a	yeah ,
57052	0	a	because
57053	0	a	Yeah .
57054	0	a	Yeah .
57055	1	a	Classical , we stay classical in that we do not reinvent the wheel .
57056	0	a	Yeah ,
57057	0	a	yeah ,
57058	0	a	yeah .
57059	0	a	Anyway it is very
57060	0	a	in general I think people change TV more often than batteries of their remote control .
57061	0	a	So .
57062	0	a	Yeah .
57063	0	a	Because the trend goes faster than the life of the
57064	0	a	So it is very
57065	0	a	Okay .
57066	0	a	Okay .
57067	0	a	So
57068	0	a	are we
57069	0	a	Yeah .
57070	0	a	Yeah , we are done .
57071	0	a	Okay .
57072	0	a	 
57073	1	a	So ,
57074	0	a	Hi Christa .
57075	0	a	So , now
57076	0	a	it is the
57077	0	a	Hi Sammy .
57078	0	a	It is the detail design meeting ,
57079	0	a	so we are going
57080	0	a	last meeting .
57081	0	a	So , first Mark and Rama are going to present the prototype .
57082	0	a	then Sammy will propose some crite cr criteria to evaluate this prototype .
57083	0	a	Then , w we
57084	0	a	And then we going to do some finance to see if it is feasible and at the end we will we will evaluate ourself as a team .
57085	0	a	Yes .
57086	0	a	Yes .
57087	0	a	And chocolate ?
57088	0	a	And that is all .
57089	1	a	Okay .
57090	1	a	So first , let is see the prototype .
57091	0	a	Yeah .
57092	0	a	, here we have our prototype model .
57093	0	a	Okay .
57094	0	a	And you have some slides then ?
57095	0	a	Yeah .
57096	0	a	Yeah .
57097	0	a	Yeah , we have also some slides .
57098	0	a	Yes , and place some slides .
57099	0	a	Okay .
57100	0	a	so in which
57101	0	a	okay .
57102	0	a	In
57103	0	a	Yeah .
57104	0	a	, participant three .
57105	0	a	Prototype .
57106	0	a	Five .
57107	0	a	, so
57108	0	a	this is our remote control .
57109	0	a	Him .
57110	0	a	It is a r working prototype .
57111	0	a	You can use it now by switching all these buttons .
57112	1	a	So first , I present as we came to this perfect model , and then we will give some technical specifications .
57113	0	a	Yeah .
57114	0	a	That is well , so that is that .
57115	1	a	Please , next slide .
57116	0	a	We analysed all the fruits and contacted NASA ,
57117	0	a	and made some real good
57118	0	a	Yeah .
57119	0	a	MASA ?
57120	0	a	Okay .
57121	0	a	If you can see this , and the stars are showing that .
57122	0	a	And , s society will accept that .
57123	0	a	For sure .
57124	0	a	And making some analysis of different fruits , we choose the ultimate form , ultimate colours , and ultimate smell of it .
57125	1	a	S please , next slide .
57126	0	a	But we still did not want to go far from our titanium idea , cause it is the most of the moder the m the modern material we can p select .
57127	0	a	And it is practical .
57128	0	a	And it is still say it is for our needs ,
57129	1	a	so please press something .
57130	0	a	And as I said , it is perfect .
57131	1	a	Please press it .
57132	0	a	Experience .
57133	0	a	Explanat
57134	0	a	See this .
57135	0	a	Everyone is f really really glad to obtain an s such a r such a device .
57136	1	a	Such a nice thing .
57137	1	a	So you can touch it with your hands .
57138	0	a	Can I ?
57139	0	a	Ho ho .
57140	0	a	Sure .
57141	0	a	You can
57142	0	a	Spongy .
57143	0	a	Yes .
57144	1	a	What do you say ?
57145	0	a	One day .
57146	0	a	N
57147	0	a	You must say it .
57148	0	a	It says
57149	0	a	I will
57150	0	a	I will buy it .
57151	0	a	Yeah .
57152	0	a	If I if I need so .
57153	0	a	He
57154	0	a	Hopefully my daughter will like it .
57155	0	a	Okay .
57156	0	a	Y and we got the answer .
57157	0	a	, it is , yes , of course .
57158	0	a	Yes , of course .
57159	0	a	Of c course .
57160	1	a	, please next slide .
57161	0	a	, this is a prototype .
57162	1	a	You can have a look at it ,
57163	0	a	and That is all I wanted to say .
57164	0	a	Now it is technical specification by our colleague .
57165	0	a	So
57166	0	a	Yeah .
57167	0	a	Oh , there is a button missing .
57168	0	a	Okay .
57169	0	a	This this is really flexible .
57170	0	a	You can add your buttons .
57171	1	a	It is in option .
57172	0	a	Yeah .
57173	0	a	So function ,
57174	0	a	So , as we discussed , we have to switch on switch off whenever we want .
57175	0	a	And so , we have buttons and using LCD , or like you can use this jog wheel and select which ever option on the LCD , and then do on and off .
57176	0	a	Then you ha you will have volume control .
57177	0	a	So , you you can press these buttons to increase or decrease the volume .
57178	0	a	And we have some LCD controls .
57179	0	a	Like , m switching the LCD display if you want to use LCD , or you do not want you can just use normal button .
57180	0	a	And we have speech recognition .
57181	0	a	Here you have microphone , and then it date records your voice , and then it try to recognise .
57182	0	a	And it can also do the action .
57183	0	a	And location finder .
57184	0	a	And we want to do the location basically using speech recogniser .
57185	0	a	You can just say , where is my remote control .
57186	1	a	Or , you can just give some nickname to your remote control , like Bobby .
57187	1	a	Hey , babe .
57188	0	a	Bobby .
57189	0	a	And then , it will say hi .
57190	0	a	Bob .
57191	0	a	Hey Bob .
57192	0	a	Yeah , hi ,
57193	0	a	and then you can use it .
57194	0	a	Okay ,
57195	0	a	that is good .
57196	0	a	Kay .
57197	0	a	So ,
57198	0	a	our team is now fruits .
57199	0	a	Mainly strawberry .
57200	0	a	So , you can have
57201	0	a	And then you can see the look LCD and all the switches .
57202	0	a	Oh , these are strawberries .
57203	0	a	Are colourful .
57204	0	a	Yeah .
57205	0	a	Material , we want to stick to titanium .
57206	0	a	We will send , we want to
57207	0	a	Yeah , or s
57208	0	a	So , we want to have simple and perfect shapes , like I shown in these phones .
57209	0	a	Fruit smelling spongy titanium .
57210	0	a	I did not know it exist ,
57211	0	a	but that is great .
57212	0	a	You can have your own designs and and you can feel simple designs .
57213	0	a	And you can choose colours on your day for each day , or even many colours .
57214	0	a	Ha .
57215	0	a	Ho ho .
57216	0	a	You mean we can change the colour of th
57217	0	a	Yeah .
57218	0	a	That is for the LCD or for the titanium ?
57219	0	a	Mm mm .
57220	0	a	For the LCD .
57221	0	a	Yeah okay , for the LCD .
57222	0	a	With titanium it is it is silver .
57223	0	a	Tit titanium is
57224	0	a	, okay .
57225	0	a	We are still working on titanium .
57226	0	a	Yeah .
57227	0	a	So , r we will start with LCD .
57228	0	a	, yeah .
57229	1	a	You can ask Bob .
57230	1	a	It is Tuesday .
57231	0	a	Yeah .
57232	1	a	Yeah , Bob , please .
57233	1	a	Hey , you know you are theme today .
57234	1	a	Tuesday colour .
57235	0	a	Yeah .
57236	1	a	Even you can configure your colours for its the depending on your mood , or s
57237	1	a	And you can have many colours on weekends .
57238	0	a	Okay .
57239	1	a	Black for Sunday .
57240	1	a	Or
57241	0	a	Huh ?
57242	0	a	, these are like sensors .
57243	0	a	And w wait ,
57244	0	a	wh what are the strawberries for ?
57245	0	a	Wh wh
57246	0	a	On the LCD ?
57247	0	a	Oh .
57248	0	a	Of course .
57249	0	a	What do you think ?
57250	0	a	Strawberry sensors .
57251	0	a	That is location sensors .
57252	0	a	Very useful .
57253	0	a	Okay .
57254	0	a	Strawberries .
57255	0	a	So ,
57256	1	a	after this meeting we will propose a party for our success for
57257	1	a	So , if you are vegetarian or you have any options , please let us know .
57258	0	a	Lounge meeting .
57259	1	a	Yeah , and we can just some strawberry first .
57260	0	a	Yeah .
57261	0	a	Oops .
57262	0	a	Alright .
57263	0	a	Good .
57264	0	a	Okay .
57265	0	a	S
57266	0	a	So , any specific questions for
57267	0	a	Yeah .
57268	0	a	So , huh .
57269	0	a	Interesting .
57270	0	a	In interesting .
57271	0	a	we will see in the financial part if all gets into
57272	1	a	W Who is the five fifty millions we first make a party in ?
57273	0	a	It makes sense .
57274	1	a	Let is make a party first maybe .
57275	0	a	Yeah .
57276	1	a	Then we can discuss
57277	0	a	We can
57278	1	a	Yeah , then we can have how much for how money is left .
57279	0	a	So , this is
57280	0	a	What a design .
57281	0	a	Okay .
57282	0	a	, so
57283	0	a	Let is ,
57284	0	a	yeah ,
57285	1	a	let is see if th it is meet the evaluation criterium .
57286	0	a	It is my turn .
57287	1	a	Let is see if this
57288	1	a	Yeah , if you meet the evaluation criterion .
57289	0	a	Yeah .
57290	0	a	Oops .
57291	0	a	Fudge .
57292	1	a	Yeah .
57293	1	a	So , evaluation please .
57294	0	a	So .
57295	0	a	You made a very nice prototype ,
57296	0	a	and , I think , we now need altogether to try to evaluate it to see if it makes sense to do it , if it fulfils our what we want to do , and things like that .
57297	0	a	So ,
57298	1	a	next slide , please .
57299	0	a	As you know , before going and creating and producing these strawberry remote control , it is very important to first verify if it makes sense , if we have a chance to sell it .
57300	0	a	Yeah .
57301	0	a	, so we need to evaluate it , try to do it in a constative way , and as much as we can .
57302	0	a	To
57303	0	a	so what I propose is that we are going to to have this scale from one to seven .
57304	0	a	One meaning that , yes it fulfils the the criterion , whatever it is .
57305	0	a	And seven meaning , no it does not fulfil at all .
57306	0	a	And we are all l going to list all the criterion .
57307	0	a	I am going to go to that next slide , and together try to evaluate this according to this criterion and from one to seven .
57308	0	a	Okay .
57309	0	a	And then we are just going to have an average , which will give us the value of our remote control .
57310	1	a	So , maybe we can have a look at the criteria ?
57311	0	a	So these are the criterion I am
57312	0	a	I thought were important .
57313	0	a	Fancy .
57314	1	a	Of course , this can be discussed , but let is let is see , so let is vote .
57315	0	a	So we have fancy here
57316	0	a	and we have the scale from one to seven with four in the middle .
57317	0	a	So ,
57318	0	a	what do you think , is it fancy ?
57319	0	a	It is very very fancy .
57320	0	a	Huh .
57321	0	a	Yeah , what is is really
57322	0	a	, it is really
57323	0	a	Yeah .
57324	0	a	, I think that fancy , we can say it is fancy .
57325	0	a	Or have you ever seen something like that ?
57326	0	a	Yeah , of course .
57327	0	a	Oh .
57328	0	a	I am not the d the only one choosing , yeah .
57329	0	a	What do you think ?
57330	0	a	Is it
57331	0	a	The weight is later .
57332	0	a	what do you think ?
57333	0	a	Uh huh .
57334	1	a	Feel the weight .
57335	0	a	Oh .
57336	0	a	Really .
57337	0	a	Now we are
57338	0	a	We are on the fanciness now .
57339	0	a	Okay .
57340	0	a	I think it is quite fancy .
57341	0	a	Yeah ,
57342	0	a	yeah .
57343	0	a	It is Yeah , so
57344	0	a	No it is it is one .
57345	1	a	We can give at least five or six , seven .
57346	0	a	Yeah .
57347	0	a	Yeah .
57348	0	a	It is in the other .
57349	0	a	Yeah , o one means it is , yes , a very fancy and seven mean no at all .
57350	0	a	Oh , Oh .
57351	0	a	So Oh , okay .
57352	0	a	Yeah , okay .
57353	0	a	Oh , okay .
57354	0	a	So
57355	0	a	M maybe two .
57356	0	a	So it is one or two .
57357	0	a	What do you think ?
57358	0	a	Two ?
57359	0	a	Okay .
57360	0	a	Two .
57361	0	a	Let is say two , yeah .
57362	0	a	Two .
57363	0	a	Two .
57364	0	a	So here , two .
57365	0	a	Up .
57366	0	a	Then we have technology .
57367	0	a	Technology .
57368	0	a	Yeah .
57369	0	a	And we have LCD .
57370	0	a	So , what about technology ?
57371	0	a	We have we have speech recognition , we have location based , we have LCD .
57372	0	a	So you change colours .
57373	0	a	Change colour of t
57374	0	a	Yeah ,
57375	0	a	I think it is a
57376	0	a	Yeah .
57377	0	a	Change colour ,
57378	0	a	I mean that is very
57379	0	a	Quite d I think it is a one for that , at least .
57380	1	a	Useful .
57381	0	a	Yeah ,
57382	0	a	yeah ,
57383	0	a	yeah .
57384	0	a	Yeah ,
57385	0	a	yeah .
57386	0	a	Yeah .
57387	0	a	Yeah .
57388	0	a	No .
57389	0	a	It is silly .
57390	0	a	At least a one , yeah .
57391	0	a	Mm mm .
57392	0	a	Robustness , uh huh .
57393	1	a	, still we need to cha
57394	0	a	Yeah , it
57395	1	a	Maybe strawberry .
57396	1	a	So let is suppose my daughter take it and and through it away .
57397	1	a	The strawberries
57398	0	a	Oh .
57399	0	a	Do you think it makes sense that it is going to live again ?
57400	0	a	, maybe not the prototype .
57401	1	a	Let is try .
57402	0	a	Oh my god .
57403	0	a	Okay , we just lost one strawberry .
57404	0	a	So
57405	0	a	Not at all ?
57406	0	a	It is
57407	0	a	Yeah .
57408	0	a	Oh .
57409	0	a	No .
57410	0	a	How can I say this .
57411	1	a	Yeah , we can easily plug it .
57412	0	a	It is still it is still working , and your daughter got a bonus .
57413	0	a	A strawberry .
57414	0	a	Yeah .
57415	0	a	So it is not so bad .
57416	0	a	Mm mm .
57417	0	a	I I would say three .
57418	0	a	Yeah ,
57419	0	a	yeah .
57420	0	a	Yeah .
57421	0	a	But it is too .
57422	0	a	Yeah .
57423	0	a	Yeah , that does make sense , yeah ?
57424	0	a	Useful .
57425	0	a	It is robust , yeah .
57426	1	a	Useful ?
57427	0	a	Yeah ,
57428	0	a	Yeah .
57429	0	a	Well , so the question is does it have the minimum requirement of re remote control ?
57430	0	a	So I do not know .
57431	0	a	These buttons are It not clear .
57432	1	a	Oh , yeah , lets me try .
57433	0	a	But you have at least next produce .
57434	0	a	Yeah .
57435	0	a	What is next , please ?
57436	0	a	And you can do di two sites ?
57437	0	a	Yeah .
57438	0	a	Yeah , channel .
57439	0	a	I this is volume control and channel changes .
57440	0	a	, it depends on the
57441	0	a	Okay .
57442	0	a	These are the main
57443	0	a	You
57444	0	a	Yeah .
57445	0	a	Yeah , and you can do on LCD using these going to scrolling all the option .
57446	0	a	Okay , also .
57447	0	a	So but , for instance , because the LCD is not touch control , touch screen , you cannot go to channel twenty five directly .
57448	0	a	So if you do not want
57449	0	a	Yeah ,
57450	0	a	yeah .
57451	0	a	You can , by using the You c push here the the
57452	0	a	yeah .
57453	0	a	Yeah .
57454	0	a	You can .
57455	0	a	Directly .
57456	0	a	You go you
57457	0	a	So , the basic mode
57458	0	a	Yeah .
57459	0	a	So that is simple .
57460	0	a	The basic mode is you got just two buttons and a jog dial .
57461	0	a	Yeah .
57462	0	a	With two buttons , you do this like volume up , volume down .
57463	0	a	Oh , it is a jog dial , okay .
57464	0	a	Uh huh .
57465	0	a	And channel .
57466	0	a	Or if you go to the site , it is channel up channel down .
57467	0	a	Okay .
57468	0	a	And if you want to make to s twenty five , you push on this .
57469	0	a	Yeah .
57470	0	a	You can select .
57471	0	a	You select twenty , you select five .
57472	0	a	Okay .
57473	0	a	That is it .
57474	0	a	Yeah .
57475	0	a	It is much longer than that that being two two five , no ?
57476	0	a	Do not you think so ?
57477	0	a	May not okay , we can go .
57478	0	a	No .
57479	0	a	That is You are right .
57480	0	a	Yeah ,
57481	0	a	yeah ,
57482	0	a	yeah .
57483	0	a	Y you need to like press two and five
57484	0	a	and Yeah .
57485	0	a	That is it is less
57486	0	a	Yeah .
57487	0	a	But it is it is nice , because people anyway do not go there .
57488	0	a	But
57489	0	a	So what do you think for it , usefulness ?
57490	0	a	Seems to be useful .
57491	0	a	Yeah ,
57492	0	a	yeah .
57493	0	a	Yeah .
57494	0	a	So , d Yeah , we need to address we want
57495	0	a	we only address two main functions here and the other functions will be on LCD .
57496	0	a	So
57497	0	a	so
57498	0	a	Yeah .
57499	1	a	Let me understand well ,
57500	0	a	because I am not sure
57501	0	a	that is for that this one are b d two dir directional button .
57502	0	a	Both .
57503	0	a	Yeah .
57504	0	a	Yeah .
57505	0	a	Yeah .
57506	0	a	Yeah .
57507	0	a	Yeah .
57508	0	a	Up down or left right .
57509	0	a	Yeah .
57510	0	a	Up .
57511	0	a	Yeah .
57512	0	a	Yeah .
57513	0	a	And which what is that ?
57514	0	a	Okay , okay .
57515	0	a	That
57516	0	a	Cool .
57517	0	a	It is a jog dial for controlling the cursor on the LCD screen .
57518	0	a	This is jog wheel .
57519	0	a	Yeah .
57520	0	a	It is a kind
57521	0	a	Oh , okay
57522	0	a	okay .
57523	0	a	Like , selecting the menus .
57524	0	a	see in LCD , like you will have blocks and you select which one .
57525	0	a	Oh oh okay , great .
57526	1	a	I would say then Two or three ?
57527	0	a	Two or three ?
57528	0	a	Two .
57529	0	a	Now it is looks us useful .
57530	0	a	Yeah .
57531	0	a	Yeah .
57532	0	a	Yeah .
57533	1	a	Two , maybe .
57534	0	a	Okay , two .
57535	0	a	Yeah .
57536	0	a	So size and weight .
57537	0	a	Yeah ,
57538	0	a	yeah .
57539	0	a	Is it the the the effective size and weight that the Is it real size , real weight ?
57540	0	a	Or Because it
57541	0	a	Size is going to be that ,
57542	0	a	yeah ?
57543	0	a	, and and
57544	0	a	It is going to be lighter ,
57545	0	a	because this seems to be very heavy
57546	0	a	f I mean ,
57547	0	a	for my daughter , for instance .
57548	0	a	Yeah , it is size al
57549	0	a	almost Yeah ,
57550	0	a	because it is
57551	0	a	The weight will be bit lighter .
57552	0	a	We will s We use titanium .
57553	0	a	Sure ,
57554	0	a	without titanium alloy , it is going to be light .
57555	0	a	Mm mm .
57556	0	a	Yeah .
57557	0	a	Yeah .
57558	0	a	Yeah .
57559	0	a	Of course .
57560	0	a	Heavy .
57561	0	a	Yeah .
57562	0	a	Yeah .
57563	0	a	Not sure if she can use it .
57564	0	a	But sides , the sides should be okay .
57565	0	a	So , should be okay .
57566	0	a	Yeah
57567	0	a	Up to three for that , because I am have not seen the weight so I must not Colour and shape .
57568	0	a	Mm mm .
57569	0	a	Okay .
57570	0	a	Oh .
57571	0	a	Okay .
57572	0	a	Uh oh .
57573	0	a	Well ,
57574	0	a	so colour , it seems that we have the several colours for the LCD .
57575	0	a	Yeah .
57576	0	a	Yeah .
57577	0	a	But , it is not very clear what is the colour of the sh the sh the case .
57578	0	a	Yeah .
57579	0	a	The case is silver titanium , no ?
57580	0	a	Yeah .
57581	0	a	It is a it is going to be titanium .
57582	0	a	Yeah , it is .
57583	0	a	Okay , okay .
57584	0	a	That is nice .
57585	1	a	Let is imagine .
57586	0	a	I think it is good .
57587	0	a	Okay .
57588	0	a	And what about the strawberries on the top ?
57589	0	a	I am not convince .
57590	0	a	Yahoo .
57591	0	a	But maybe I am not trendy .
57592	0	a	But ,
57593	0	a	Yeah , but they are not useful .
57594	0	a	Well y you know , it is this fruit and vegetable year .
57595	0	a	Oh .
57596	0	a	Yeah ,
57597	0	a	yeah .
57598	0	a	So
57599	0	a	, I think usefulness is m as as
57600	0	a	I rem just have to remind you that usefulness is much less important than fanciness .
57601	0	a	Yeah .
57602	0	a	I
57603	0	a	I mean it that is
57604	0	a	So maybe , I think
57605	0	a	Yeah .
57606	0	a	Yep .
57607	0	a	Yeah ,
57608	0	a	well Yeah .
57609	0	a	Whether it is fancy or not now , it we have to decide .
57610	0	a	Yeah , well then it is bit difficult to use .
57611	0	a	But this If it is
57612	0	a	Uh huh .
57613	0	a	I would have m
57614	0	a	i found more fancy that the fruits are useful .
57615	1	a	So , that they will that maybe the fruit may be here instead .
57616	0	a	Yeah .
57617	0	a	Not like this d
57618	0	a	We are just giving the fruit for more fanciness and more attraction , too .
57619	0	a	But the n
57620	0	a	Yeah .
57621	1	a	So , maybe think we can have rubber or some sponges , stuff for strawberries and different colours .
57622	0	a	So it is Even These buttons
57623	0	a	But it looks really not really good .
57624	0	a	So , it seems we are not so clear on the shape I suggested three .
57625	0	a	No ,
57626	0	a	I am not sure why
57627	1	a	if it was like this
57628	0	a	I It is n
57629	0	a	no , it is not fancy any more .
57630	0	a	I mean , the f
57631	0	a	Yeah .
57632	0	a	So these are kind of rubber things .
57633	0	a	Even if you lose one you can just put whatever .
57634	0	a	Okay .
57635	0	a	And
57636	0	a	Moreover , moreover
57637	0	a	it covers it covers all the end goals .
57638	1	a	Even we can provide many different colours or different fruits , and
57639	0	a	Yeah .
57640	0	a	Uh huh .
57641	0	a	And different routes .
57642	0	a	Okay , I see what
57643	0	a	Okay , so you you you feel like it is something a protection for the remote control .
57644	0	a	Even if it is , you know , it is very rounded , but still you got some rubber fruit here , and it is completely completely secure to leave it with children and that .
57645	0	a	Yeah .
57646	0	a	Yeah .
57647	0	a	Yeah .
57648	0	a	Yeah .
57649	0	a	Yeah , we have yeah
57650	0	a	we have sensors here and so here and here ,
57651	0	a	so we just
57652	0	a	Yeah ,
57653	0	a	so even if you do not put , it works .
57654	0	a	Also .
57655	0	a	But this is really fancy .
57656	0	a	Okay .
57657	0	a	Okay .
57658	0	a	Because , everybody s does not seem to be convince ,
57659	0	a	although it is quite
57660	0	a	You have good arguments .
57661	0	a	Okay .
57662	0	a	Okay .
57663	0	a	Yeah .
57664	0	a	Yeah .
57665	0	a	But
57666	0	a	And the last one is adaptive .
57667	0	a	Okay .
57668	0	a	This is not r maybe not as important as the other one ,
57669	0	a	but can we adapt it to each each personal use ?
57670	0	a	Great .
57671	0	a	Yeah .
57672	0	a	Sure , sure , just look at it .
57673	0	a	It is full adaptable .
57674	0	a	Fully adaptable .
57675	0	a	Wow , that is a
57676	0	a	Yea
57677	0	a	Yeah , it is fudge titanium .
57678	0	a	Yeah , you can fit it into your palm , you know .
57679	0	a	That is
57680	0	a	Yeah .
57681	0	a	So you can fit into your palm , okay .
57682	0	a	That
57683	0	a	What else can we need ?
57684	0	a	You Do you think you are going to be able to do that with ti titanium as well ?
57685	0	a	It is fudge , yeah ,
57686	0	a	yeah .
57687	0	a	Yeah .
57688	0	a	You can

57691	0	a	Right
57692	0	a	, yeah .
57693	0	a	It is two point one seven .
57694	0	a	Yeah , fruit titanium , yeah .
57695	0	a	And
57696	0	a	Okay .
57697	0	a	Well , I if if this is
57698	0	a	if you are ready to do that , then I think it deserves a one .
57699	0	a	Yeah .
57700	0	a	Let is go for one .
57701	0	a	Okay .
57702	0	a	Yeah .
57703	0	a	Now we have to do the average .
57704	0	a	Three , three , six , eight , eleven .
57705	1	a	Who is good in math ?
57706	0	a	Okay .
57707	0	a	Two point one seven .
57708	0	a	That is nice .
57709	0	a	Two point one seven out of seven .
57710	0	a	I think we have a good good thing .
57711	0	a	Yeah .
57712	0	a	Well , that is all I had to say about the evaluation .
57713	0	a	So
57714	0	a	It seems to be good , yeah .
57715	0	a	So it is a good evaluation .
57716	0	a	Yeah .
57717	0	a	Yeah .

57796	0	a	And then we have the t sample speaker sensor for speech recognition .
57797	0	a	And for the One also .
57798	0	a	One or two ?
57799	0	a	One ?
57800	0	a	Okay .

57802	0	a	Yeah , one .
57803	0	a	So the case , which one is it in the end ?
57804	0	a	Let is do a single curve .
57805	1	a	Yeah , I think we will go for a single curve ,
57806	0	a	no ?
57807	0	a	Oh , is
57808	0	a	Oh .
57809	0	a	It is it is flat .

57816	1	a	you Look .
57817	0	a	It is curvable .
57818	0	a	It is curvable ,
57819	0	a	but it is not curved .
57820	1	a	Maybe there is a supplement for that ,
57821	0	a	no ?
57822	0	a	It is only curve ?
57823	1	a	Okay , let is go .
57824	0	a	Oh see , I

57879	0	a	Okay .
57880	0	a	That is that is not

57889	0	a	Or only a scroll wheel .
57890	0	a	Yeah .
57891	0	a	Only scroll wheel .
57892	0	a	Yeah .
57893	0	a	So
57894	0	a	It is already
57895	0	a	You are trying to make make up make us up .
57896	0	a	You try to s
57897	0	a	No , no , no .
57898	0	a	Because how do you do to y select ?
57899	0	a	Yeah , I mean you you go on the location with your scroll wheel
57900	0	a	and then you
57901	0	a	Stay longer .
57902	0	a	No , but you select with the two d the other two buttons ,
57903	0	a	no ?
57904	0	a	That is true .
57905	0	a	Y
57906	0	a	Yeah .

57923	0	a	Special form .
57924	0	a	You you have all of these , no ?
57925	0	a	maybe n not this one
57926	0	a	but
57927	0	a	Yeah ,
57928	1	a	so
57929	0	a	Not special colours an interest in ?
57930	0	a	And buttons are not colourised ?
57931	0	a	They are m
57932	0	a	Boo hoo .
57933	0	a	She is very hard on this .
57934	0	a	Special colour ?
57935	0	a	Yeah .
57936	0	a	No .
57937	1	a	Special material ?
57938	0	a	Yeah ,
57939	0	a	buttons are the standard buttons .
57940	0	a	, we have titan
57941	0	a	Yeah .
57942	0	a	That is for buttons .
57943	0	a	But buttons are standard .
57944	0	a	Yeah .
57945	0	a	It is only buttons , these .
57946	0	a	Nothing special .
57947	0	a	Okay .
57948	0	a	So we are at seventeen dot eight .
57949	0	a	No , the colour is in the LCD .
57950	0	a	I no .
57951	0	a	I think because you can just go for a good colours .
57952	1	a	We can just use this red .
57953	0	a	Yeah ,
57954	0	a	and
57955	0	a	Yeah .
57956	0	a	It is So what is
57957	0	a	Are we supposed to cut things out now ? , until we get twelve fifty .
57958	0	a	It is already too expensive .
57959	0	a	Apparently .
57960	0	a	Yeah .
57961	0	a	Oh .
57962	1	a	So think of what we can cut here .
57963	0	a	Well ,
57964	0	a	if I look at what is the most expensive things , it is the LCD and the speaker .
57965	0	a	Sample speaker .
57966	0	a	Yeah .
57967	0	a	Apparently , we have to choose one or the other .
57968	0	a	Yeah .
57969	0	a	Yeah .
57970	0	a	Yeah .
57971	0	a	Well ,
57972	0	a	as you may know there is some research done in the field of producing energy from mechanical eng , I mean , producing electricity from mechanical energy .
57973	0	a	So , the point is that when you take device and push the button , you produce enough energy to make electricity .
57974	0	a	But you do not need a battery ?
57975	0	a	Yeah ,
57976	0	a	that you do not need a battery .
57977	0	a	So , it is something like hand dynamo robot .
57978	0	a	A real high tech version of it .
57979	0	a	So that would
57980	0	a	So , but if we select the hand dynamo it is okay ,
57981	0	a	we only
57982	0	a	We we win one .
57983	0	a	But
57984	0	a	it is like the hand dynamo , no ?
57985	0	a	it is a it is a beginning .
57986	1	a	Maybe the jog wheel can be like kind of hand
57987	0	a	is
57988	0	a	Yeah .
57989	0	a	Okay , Why not .
57990	0	a	That is already that .
57991	1	a	Okay , let is do that .
57992	0	a	Yeah .
57993	0	a	Okay .
57994	1	a	Let is do that .
57995	0	a	So
57996	0	a	One here and here .
57997	0	a	Yeah , just remo S
57998	0	a	Yeah .
57999	0	a	Kay .
58000	0	a	And I propose to
58001	1	a	So , about chips .
58002	0	a	Advanced chip on print , right ?
58003	1	a	So , put minus one there , please .
58004	0	a	I am not sure if this is legal .
58005	0	a	Why not ?
58006	1	a	And ?
58007	0	a	So , was there result ?
58008	1	a	Let is have a look .
58009	1	a	That is right .
58010	0	a	, no .
58011	1	a	And ?
58012	0	a	No .
58013	1	a	M maybe minus three , no ?
58014	0	a	Yeah .
58015	1	a	Okay , let is see .
58016	0	a	No , no .
58017	0	a	It is not
58018	0	a	It is not changing , no ?
58019	0	a	It you do not
58020	0	a	So now on , we can increase our Still
58021	0	a	you have two more .
58022	0	a	Yeah ,
58023	0	a	yeah ,
58024	0	a	yeah ,
58025	0	a	if
58026	1	a	Click somewhere ,

58191	0	a	Okay .
58192	0	a	Yeah .
58193	0	a	Yeah ,
58194	0	a	we have other remote controls to create .

58196	0	a	New materials .
58197	0	a	Okay .
58198	0	a	, we got new idea , speech recognition , location finding .
58199	0	a	A lot of
58200	0	a	Yeah ,

58273	0	a	Good morning .
58274	0	a	Good morning .
58275	0	a	So , we are asked to to make a new remote control for television .
58276	0	a	And the characteristics of this new remote control should be original and trendy and of course user user friendly .
58277	0	a	So people can can use it without any any problem .
58278	0	a	I do not know .
58279	1	a	Well , I think we should set the the points to to drive the project and
58280	0	a	Yeah , from the account manager .
58281	0	a	B did you send us an email about this ?
58282	0	a	Yeah , we we received an email about this d designs .
58283	0	a	, not yet ,
58284	1	a	but if you want Do you want do you want me to send you a mail ?
58285	0	a	Or .
58286	0	a	it is Okay .
58287	1	a	Or you can put it in the shared folder .
58288	0	a	Yeah ,
58289	0	a	you see the email ?
58290	0	a	You email .
58291	0	a	The v very
58292	0	a	no , no
58293	0	a	the first one .
58294	0	a	No , I did not get it .

58296	1	a	This one .
58297	0	a	No , no .
58298	0	a	No .
58299	0	a	The third one .
58300	0	a	Oh , you did not get anything .
58301	0	a	No , .
58302	0	a	It is strange .
58303	0	a	I got an email about the dis about the discussion .
58304	0	a	Yeah .
58305	0	a	You get email , .
58306	0	a	I dunno from who .
58307	0	a	From the account manager .
58308	0	a	You have received the same email , right ?
58309	0	a	Yeah .
58310	0	a	Yeah .
58311	0	a	I think it is for your guys to how to design it all the aspects
58312	0	a	so you need that information .
58313	0	a	Yeah .
58314	0	a	Yeah , I think so .
58315	0	a	Yeah , so each of us has a role to do .
58316	0	a	Yeah
58317	1	a	I think assign your roles .
58318	0	a	S
58319	0	a	For each for each one .
58320	0	a	In each
58321	0	a	We already have our role .
58322	0	a	For each person , yeah .
58323	0	a	Kay , we can
58324	0	a	So there are three kinds of designs , that is all .
58325	0	a	So there are so we have three
58326	0	a	f
58327	0	a	yeah .
58328	0	a	We have functional design , conceptual design , and detail design .
58329	0	a	Okay , alright .
58330	0	a	So , who will be the the responsible for the functional design ?
58331	1	a	Any any volunteer ?
58332	0	a	You are doing th
58333	0	a	I think our responsibilities will be assigned when we in our mail we received from the account manager .
58334	0	a	Yeah ,
58335	0	a	yeah .
58336	0	a	No ,
58337	0	a	I am doing the interface .
58338	0	a	I am doing the interface .
58339	0	a	Are you using the you are doing the in
58340	0	a	Okay .
58341	0	a	Yeah I
58342	0	a	I am
58343	0	a	I am
58344	0	a	Well , maybe we have
58345	0	a	okay so I industrial design .
58346	0	a	It was a little confusion about my
58347	0	a	but it is alright .
58348	0	a	Okay , I will for industrial design .
58349	0	a	Yeah .
58350	0	a	Okay .
58351	0	a	And and you Norman ?
58352	0	a	And
58353	0	a	And
58354	0	a	doing the marketing .
58355	0	a	working on i .
58356	0	a	User .
58357	0	a	User interface .
58358	0	a	, I am into marketing .
58359	0	a	yeah
58360	0	a	nothing much in the project .
58361	0	a	Nothing related here to the
58362	0	a	Next .
58363	0	a	Marketing in this design .
58364	0	a	A design is basically for industrial design and the user interface .
58365	0	a	Yes .
58366	1	a	You see the second mail ?
58367	0	a	Yeah , it is inside .
58368	1	a	Go down .
58369	0	a	Appendix .
58370	0	a	Yeah , this is .
58371	0	a	See there is a role for everybody .
58372	0	a	Yeah , that is right ,
58373	0	a	first .
58374	0	a	Even for the marketing .
58375	0	a	us user define .
58376	1	a	But look at your role , your marketing role .
58377	0	a	There is a trend watching .
58378	0	a	I do not know .
58379	0	a	Yeah ,
58380	0	a	that is your role .
58381	0	a	I .
58382	1	a	Well , I think we can have a little discussion about what has to be done and what are your ideas about the
58383	0	a	Well , w we want to have a new re remote control for for TV distribution I guess .
58384	1	a	About the design or Maybe we will discuss this later , no ?
58385	0	a	So we have to plan how how it would be developed and how we can make it work .
58386	0	a	Yeah .
58387	0	a	Yes .
58388	0	a	I mean working remotes we already have .
58389	0	a	This will be something different from the other remotes remote controls .
58390	0	a	Yeah ,
58391	0	a	I dunno
58392	0	a	I
58393	0	a	Yeah .
58394	0	a	What we we have to keep in mind the these characteristics .
58395	0	a	And of course it should not be very costly .
58396	0	a	Yeah , that is right .
58397	0	a	So About the
58398	0	a	about what ?
58399	0	a	You mean the external or
58400	0	a	Yeah of g of course .
58401	0	a	Well I I think that Norman and I would think about the technical points
58402	1	a	and we should discuss it in the next meeting , or
58403	0	a	Yeah .
58404	0	a	Need to collect information .
58405	0	a	I I am part of design , perhaps .
58406	0	a	, what is most important in a in a remote control ?
58407	0	a	What is the most important function aspect ?
58408	0	a	Well , you have to make it work .
58409	0	a	That is the that is the big thing .
58410	0	a	That is alright .
58411	0	a	Yeah , it should be easy to work with .
58412	0	a	Yeah .
58413	0	a	Yeah .
58414	0	a	Yeah .
58415	1	a	We can think about an interface with well
58416	0	a	Yeah ,
58417	0	a	yeah .
58418	1	a	We maybe you can have a speech recognition interface .
58419	1	a	You just tell the television I want which channel .
58420	1	a	Or or you can say for example , I want to list all the programme tonight .
58421	0	a	You wo not
58422	0	a	I I think if we include a lot of technology on the remote control it will be very costly .
58423	1	a	Y you know , instead of remote control it is doing the some searching for you , so you do not have to look for the channel you want .
58424	1	a	Just say maybe I just want to press I want to have a button for all the movies tonight .
58425	1	a	Or a button for all the magazines , all the information documentary tonight .
58426	1	a	And then you list a few , and I will choose from the list .
58427	1	a	So instead of pressing the channel number , I am choosing the programmes directly .
58428	0	a	Yeah , that is one way of making it useful .
58429	0	a	No ,
58430	0	a	because
58431	0	a	no ,
58432	0	a	it is not very a lot .
58433	0	a	S
58434	0	a	Like s you
58435	0	a	you
58436	0	a	you say we can use speech .
58437	0	a	Th this information exists .
58438	0	a	For example you can get
58439	0	a	You can use well for example anything .
58440	0	a	The the idea of using speech to reduce the button , but and it is more natural .
58441	0	a	I
58442	1	a	I think if you want t to choose from a list of programme or or something like that you you may have to to use w
58443	1	a	I dunno
58444	0	a	Yeah .
58445	0	a	Yeah .
58446	0	a	I am a okay .
58447	0	a	Yeah .
58448	0	a	Yeah .
58449	0	a	I mean the main function of remote control is to have something in the hand
58450	0	a	and we should be very careful about the size of the remote control .
58451	0	a	In the hand .
58452	0	a	Yeah .
58453	0	a	Yeah .
58454	0	a	If we are going to add a speech interface , I am not sure with trendy slim size of the remote control it would be able to put a speech recog
58455	1	a	if you want to put a speech recognition system f interface for that
58456	1	a	I think the TV itself could have it .
58457	0	a	Yeah .
58458	0	a	Yes , possible .
58459	0	a	Yeah .
58460	0	a	Yeah .
58461	0	a	But Yeah .
58462	0	a	And I could talk to the TV television itself .
58463	0	a	Except if if you are far from the TV .
58464	0	a	I need not have an
58465	1	a	I mean we have some or something , different technology
58466	1	a	but
58467	0	a	, yeah .
58468	0	a	This is it is
58469	0	a	Yeah ,
58470	0	a	yeah .
58471	1	a	But th the main idea I wanted to s
58472	1	a	I wanted to say is that there should be a function , instead of choosing the ch TV channel
58473	1	a	, there is a option you can choose , either TV channels or or pr or the or the contain or the contents of the programme .
58474	1	a	On the content .
58475	0	a	Yeah ,
58476	0	a	yeah
58477	0	a	it is it is a good idea
58478	0	a	it is a good idea
58479	0	a	but
58480	0	a	I
58481	0	a	I think that technically it would be a little bit more tricky to to achieve this than just to
58482	0	a	Yeah yeah .
58483	0	a	So it is more powerful .
58484	0	a	Yeah .
58485	0	a	No .
58486	0	a	No ,
58487	0	a	because you see now all the TV programmes are available on the webs .
58488	0	a	They they are they are they are available in XML format or whatever the format .
58489	0	a	We do not care .
58490	0	a	We just say that this are some content .
58491	1	a	We just want to retrieve the content and then classi sort them by the types of programmes .
58492	0	a	Some of the websites they already provide this service ,
58493	1	a	so we can just use the service available .
58494	1	a	Download it to the to this remote control .
58495	1	a	And then there is there are only six buttons for six categories , or sev seven .
58496	1	a	The most there are only seven buttons .
58497	1	a	So I just choose the category one and you reuse the same button , for example to to choose among the the sorted list the programme you want , so you do not have to choose among hundred channels ,
58498	1	a	if you have hundred channels , you just have six buttons , seven buttons .
58499	1	a	Yeah we should also optimise the the number of buttons .
58500	1	a	Well I
58501	1	a	I
58502	1	a	I
58503	1	a	I think that j just by using navigation buttons and the user interface on the screen we are able to navigate through the Well channel programme or contents or in an easy way , so
58504	0	a	Yeah in the dis display on the TV screen and just with the with your remote control would just navigate through the f
58505	0	a	Yeah ,
58506	0	a	yeah .
58507	0	a	Yeah ,
58508	0	a	yeah .
58509	0	a	This is good idea .
58510	0	a	Yeah .
58511	0	a	, yes .
58512	0	a	So .
58513	0	a	Yeah .
58514	0	a	Yeah , so you do not have to display here , just display on the TV screen , right ?
58515	0	a	Good idea .
58516	0	a	Okay .
58517	0	a	I think I think that will be revol revolutionary .
58518	0	a	Because all the TV the the remote control have all numbers , lots of buttons and then you dunno what to choose in the end .
58519	0	a	Yeah .
58520	0	a	So
58521	0	a	I think for for the technical points we have to to to check how to gather the data from programme or contents and all this stuff
58522	0	a	Oh right so
58523	1	a	Please , Norman , draw
58524	0	a	Okay .
58525	0	a	Alright .
58526	0	a	Okay .
58527	0	a	So we have five minutes to
58528	0	a	you can y
58529	0	a	you can you can use it if you so
58530	0	a	, can we S
58531	0	a	You it .
58532	0	a	w w we have sometimes to use the white board .
58533	0	a	Five minutes .
58534	1	a	And another interesting idea for this would be to have an light adaptation system depending upon the picture of So , I mean , if you are watching a movie and suddenly there is a dark some dark scene , the lights adapt themself .
58535	0	a	Okay .
58536	0	a	Okay .
58537	0	a	Yeah .
58538	0	a	Yeah .
58539	1	a	The lighting in the room changes .
58540	0	a	Yeah , but we are designing just remote control .
58541	1	a	I mean , we have a option in the remote control .
58542	1	a	If we want to have that option , you press that button in the remote .
58543	0	a	Okay .
58544	1	a	Okay , do you want to have a conceptual remote control there , or you just want to put the function in ?
58545	1	a	Go on , draw something .
58546	0	a	Yeah .
58547	1	a	If if you you you can if you want you can use th the .
58548	0	a	Oh , I am afraid you forgot to put your lapel .
58549	0	a	Where is it ?
58550	0	a	, okay .
58551	0	a	The lapel .
58552	0	a	Or before the before the the design that says .
58553	0	a	Where where is it ?
58554	1	a	Here .
58555	0	a	Yeah , that one .
58556	0	a	Just plug it .
58557	0	a	Norman .
58558	0	a	Be before before writing you can sit and that says what we what we said then after that you can you can use the .
58559	0	a	Okay , alright .
58560	0	a	So so the most functional des
58561	0	a	the most important function is to ch choo buttons to choose the content .
58562	0	a	Yeah .
58563	0	a	Right ?
58564	0	a	We agree on that , right ?
58565	0	a	, first one is to buttons i or it could be anything with buttons .
58566	0	a	Okay .
58567	0	a	Yeah .
58568	0	a	to choose content s or channels .
58569	0	a	So we have both .
58570	0	a	The user can choose w which one they want , right ?
58571	0	a	By content or by channel .
58572	0	a	Yeah , by content or by channel , it is a good idea .
58573	0	a	Choose by contents or by channels .
58574	0	a	And then what did we say just now ?
58575	0	a	Other than this .
58576	0	a	And we we have to find a way how to gather information about the contents .
58577	0	a	Okay ,
58578	0	a	so technically how the problems that how to do it is to how to get the content .
58579	0	a	Yeah .
58580	0	a	Challenge .
58581	0	a	I think i it is not very difficult to to browse by channel
58582	0	a	but it is a little bit tricky to browse by contents so
58583	0	a	I think that is the the things to do
58584	1	a	and to reflect about it and discuss it in the next meeting .
58585	0	a	Okay .
58586	0	a	Content .
58587	0	a	Okay ,
58588	0	a	so these we have to work it out .
58589	0	a	So this one of the problem .
58590	0	a	And The main thing .
58591	0	a	Okay .
58592	0	a	Alright .
58593	0	a	Alright , okay .
58594	0	a	So we are
58595	1	a	we will discuss it we will get some information in the next meeting ,
58596	0	a	so for now we get the funct this is the functional designer ?
58597	0	a	That is the first aspect .
58598	0	a	Right .
58599	0	a	We will get information and then we will come back in .
58600	0	a	Okay .
58601	0	a	Thank you everybody .
58602	0	a	Okay .
58603	0	a	Yeah , we will come .
58604	1	a	So maybe we will meet in maybe five minutes ?
58605	1	a	And we will discuss the other other aspects .
58606	0	a	Alright .
58607	0	a	Alright , okay .
58608	0	a	Thank you ,
58609	0	a	Okay .
58610	0	a	 
58611	0	a	So we come again for the the second meeting .
58612	0	a	for the aim of this meeting now is to to make presentation about the work for each one .
58613	0	a	And take the the decision about the the design and the functionality of the the remote control .
58614	0	a	Okay .
58615	0	a	Okay .
58616	0	a	And we have think I got a new project requirement .
58617	0	a	So I think teletext becomes outdated .
58618	0	a	So the popularity of the since the popularity of the internet , and I think we do not need lighting adaptive , so the remote control should be only used for the the television .
58619	0	a	Okay .
58620	0	a	And of course we should have our image in the in the design .
58621	1	a	So , let is start with the the industrial designer .
58622	0	a	Yeah , alright .
58623	0	a	So
58624	0	a	Well I have a PowerPoint pr presentation stored in my in my personal folder
58625	0	a	so I
58626	0	a	I
58627	0	a	I think you can reach it from here .
58628	0	a	Or y you can use the whiteboard if you want .
58629	0	a	Here .
58630	1	a	Just go to explorer .
58631	0	a	Or open .
58632	0	a	Oh okay .
58633	0	a	Participant two .
58634	0	a	Participant two .
58635	0	a	This one .
58636	0	a	Yeah .
58637	1	a	Open .
58638	1	a	open .
58639	0	a	Do you want to open
58640	0	a	Because it is open you mean .
58641	0	a	Right , so I will talk about the the w working design and
58642	0	a	And well I I will present my my first idea on how to build the our new remote control for television .
58643	1	a	F five .
58644	1	a	Slide show , view slide show , .
58645	1	a	So can you go one page down , please .
58646	0	a	So I think the first things to do is to define the hardware components neededs to achieve what we want to do .
58647	0	a	So I am thin
58648	1	a	I think I I will do a survey about what is what is available on the market and what what is the the cheapest possible things we hav we can use .
58649	1	a	Then I will try with the technical team to to build a prototype and to see with h how this little box would look look like .
58650	1	a	And how an and we can start troubleshooting first com communication problems or things like that .
58651	1	a	And when we are ready with this first prototype
58652	1	a	I
58653	1	a	I think we can add some software functionalities on a programmable chip like browsing by content or things like that .
58654	1	a	Okay so can you go down
58655	0	a	So , wha what I think for now is we do not want to have a remote control w which is wired
58656	0	a	so I think we u
58657	0	a	we can use a battery for the .
58658	1	a	Then two programmable chips for both software functionalities and communication .
58659	0	a	And the communication with the TV set is made through infrared communication
58660	0	a	So this is the the schema of the o of the future remote controls so you can you can see the components , battery and the two chips goes to the infrared connection to the TV set .
58661	0	a	Did you draw it ?
58662	0	a	This .
58663	0	a	Wow .
58664	0	a	This .
58665	0	a	What is the other chip for ?
58666	0	a	The one on top .
58667	0	a	The one on top is for the well the functionali the functionalities and the the th red sorry the green one is is to well , putting things together , f transform the data into qu into the format to to to communicate with the TV set .
58668	1	a	One is a communication .
58669	0	a	For men .
58670	0	a	To the in
58671	0	a	Okay .
58672	0	a	And , that is it .
58673	1	a	I think we should use a FPGA for for the functionalities which is easy to to t
58674	0	a	It is field programmable something array .
58675	0	a	What is FPGA ?
58676	0	a	So why is it how is it different from the Bluetooth ?
58677	0	a	Yeah .
58678	0	a	Gateway arrays .
58679	0	a	Yeah .
58680	0	a	It is a field programmable gateway arrays .
58681	0	a	Well , a FPGA is just a chip
58682	0	a	you can you can pr programme it wi with wh whatever you want .
58683	0	a	Programme it .
58684	0	a	Yeah .
58685	0	a	Okay .
58686	0	a	And well the Bluetooth chip is just responsible to make the communication between the two devices .
58687	0	a	Yeah .
58688	0	a	So this are the they have to work together ?
58689	0	a	Or ?
58690	0	a	Do they have to work together or two separate choice
58691	0	a	Okay .
58692	0	a	No .
58693	0	a	Well , th the FPGA will produce the the data to send .
58694	1	a	Or it is something like is not hardware the first one ?
58695	1	a	And the second one is for the software .
58696	0	a	Is the is the software par
58697	0	a	alri
58698	0	a	okay .
58699	0	a	Yeah to run th to make it run .
58700	0	a	Yeah .
58701	0	a	That is it .
58702	0	a	Okay , okay .
58703	0	a	So you can control if you want , right ?
58704	0	a	Yeah .
58705	0	a	No .
58706	0	a	Alright and that is it for the working design .
58707	0	a	So if you have any questions ?
58708	0	a	no no
58709	0	a	no
58710	0	a	no
58711	0	a	, I think we have to to have embedded b batteries in in the
58712	0	a	yeah into the t .
58713	0	a	Okay , and how about the battery power ?
58714	0	a	you mean that battery would be somewhere there and the remote contro the power to the battery comes through infrared ?
58715	0	a	Into the
58716	0	a	more compact and okay ,
58717	0	a	Yeah ,
58718	0	a	yeah .
58719	0	a	And I I do not think it will need very much power to make it run , so
58720	0	a	Yeah .
58721	0	a	Yeah ,
58722	0	a	yeah .
58723	0	a	Okay .
58724	1	a	You can put it on the charger when you when you do not need to use it .
58725	0	a	It is a good idea .
58726	0	a	Yeah , that is right .
58727	0	a	Yeah .
58728	0	a	Having a charger rather than putting the battery cells always .
58729	0	a	Yeah ,
58730	0	a	yeah .
58731	0	a	Yeah .
58732	0	a	People do not like it to have to buy the batteries when they run out .
58733	0	a	Yeah .
58734	0	a	We just make a small charger
58735	0	a	and put it Bu
58736	0	a	Our remote , we do not want to make it PDA .
58737	0	a	Y
58738	0	a	yeah ,
58739	0	a	yeah .
58740	1	a	Because you are using because you are using Bluetooth , if some people have PDA they can use their PDA to control the TV if they want to , right ?
58741	0	a	I dunno .
58742	0	a	That is a good idea .
58743	0	a	You can i
58744	0	a	yeah .
58745	0	a	Ma
58746	0	a	Yeah we can change the b .
58747	0	a	Also ,
58748	0	a	but
58749	0	a	but I
58750	0	a	I
58751	0	a	I think the the goal is to sell our remote control .
58752	0	a	Yeah .
58753	0	a	S okay , so charger for is the .
58754	0	a	So is mine .
58755	0	a	It is mine .
58756	0	a	Oh .
58757	0	a	Participant one , no ?
58758	0	a	Yeah , this your
58759	0	a	Yeah .
58760	0	a	Oh we have
58761	0	a	so let is move to to user interface design .
58762	1	a	So you can open
58763	0	a	three .
58764	0	a	Participant
58765	0	a	During the weekend .
58766	0	a	Yeah .
58767	0	a	So
58768	0	a	So I am working on the technical functions design .
58769	1	a	can you show the next slide .
58770	0	a	So the the purpose is to to find the important questions to ask is what effect should the apparatus have .
58771	0	a	So so I found on a webs on the internet
58772	0	a	yeah .
58773	0	a	I spent a lot of time searching and
58774	0	a	and I found that the function of remote control is to send messages to television set .
58775	0	a	That is good .
58776	0	a	G
58777	0	a	Yeah , not the TVs .
58778	0	a	For example switch on , switch off , switch the next channel and so on and so on .
58779	0	a	So I found two very good prototypes for for this interface from our competitors
58780	1	a	so can you
58781	0	a	Yeah ,
58782	0	a	yeah ,
58783	0	a	yeah .
58784	0	a	This are usual functionality .
58785	0	a	Ours is a bit different .
58786	0	a	So these are two example .
58787	0	a	One is from the other one is from , yeah , engineering centr
58788	0	a	yeah .
58789	0	a	Tasks .
58790	0	a	This is the most competing prototypes I have found .
58791	0	a	But then loo but then I found if you look at you see on the left one there are too many buttons
58792	0	a	Yeah .
58793	0	a	And they are small .
58794	0	a	O on the right I tried to play with the problem is that if I have hundred channels I have I have to choo press the other button to choose the hundred channels
58795	0	a	and I have to compose the number
58796	0	a	so it is very lousy .
58797	0	a	Yeah .
58798	0	a	Of course .
58799	1	a	So you so you move to the next the next one .
58800	0	a	Yeah , so I talk about the problem .
58801	0	a	And then I I look at the user manual
58802	0	a	they are a hundred pages thick , so we do not want that .
58803	0	a	Yeah .
58804	1	a	So I propose the easy to use prototype .
58805	1	a	You can navigate on TV screen and we can the user is preference and we need to have the TV connected to internet so we end in order to access the TV programmes by XML
58806	1	a	and we need some to do some preprocessing .
58807	1	a	From the technical aspect , the processing should be done on the TV set than on the on the remote controller , right ?
58808	1	a	And
58809	1	a	then we the speech recognition as Harry says we may just put in we may KIV .
58810	0	a	What do you mean by the pa pa processing will be done on the TV
58811	0	a	than the
58812	0	a	So we should have specific TV ?
58813	0	a	Or ?
58814	0	a	We can use this .
58815	0	a	Yeah , all the processing is done the TV is a compu has some processing power
58816	0	a	the
58817	0	a	Yeah .
58818	0	a	So we have to t
58819	1	a	We have to sell a TV with the remote control too .
58820	0	a	Yeah , we do not
58821	0	a	Yeah , I think so .
58822	0	a	Yeah because are you just wondering what controller okay .
58823	0	a	J j just the remote control .
58824	0	a	I think there there is there is al there
58825	0	a	there is a a technology like show view who is already available on most of the TV set on recorders or thing like that
58826	1	a	and we can try t to get this information on to the remote control to to do the processing on the remote control because
58827	0	a	Yes , that is a good idea , I think .
58828	0	a	Yeah .
58829	0	a	Okay .
58830	0	a	Yeah .
58831	0	a	Yeah .
58832	0	a	Yeah , that is right .
58833	0	a	Okay .
58834	0	a	So i the processing on on the remote controller so it can u be used in any TV , any conventional TV sets ?
58835	0	a	Yeah ,
58836	0	a	we .
58837	0	a	Yeah .
58838	0	a	Okay .
58839	0	a	Speech recognition .
58840	0	a	N
58841	0	a	yeah , that is all .
58842	1	a	The next one ?
58843	0	a	So I come up with a simple design ,
58844	1	a	just keep the v navigation buttons .
58845	0	a	Keep the navigation
58846	0	a	but .
58847	0	a	We d we do not we we do not need really much buttons to i if we have a screen to navigate on on the TV
58848	0	a	so
58849	0	a	Well , f four five buttons , it is sufficient .
58850	0	a	Yeah .
58851	0	a	Yeah .
58852	0	a	Yeah .
58853	0	a	It is easy to build , it does not consume much power .
58854	0	a	Yeah , that is right .
58855	0	a	Okay , that is all .
58856	0	a	Oh , but you have a catch there ,
58857	0	a	assume that if you want to go to if you are watching channel two and if you want to go to channel ninety nine , then .
58858	0	a	Well , then y you you go to the main menu and you have go to channel
58859	0	a	and then you can
58860	0	a	Yeah .
58861	0	a	No , because you choose by channel , so you choose by TV program
58862	0	a	so you do not have hundred channels to choose from .
58863	0	a	Uh huh huh huh huh .
58864	0	a	Maybe you .
58865	0	a	If you go by channel , you do not have to do that .
58866	0	a	but I
58867	0	a	I think i i if you if you want to to make well a a big jump
58868	0	a	but well you you have to to have a a a device
58869	0	a	when you could you could
58870	0	a	Well , not a mouse
58871	1	a	but something that that says more clearly that right , left , up , down , well , the to have the ability to to to write something to the navigator , maybe directly , or
58872	0	a	So ,
58873	1	a	we can think of buttons like in the telephone to send messages or things like that .
58874	0	a	But
58875	0	a	Yeah
58876	0	a	then
58877	0	a	yeah
58878	0	a	that is right .
58879	0	a	So you are
58880	0	a	, a big jump .
58881	1	a	A mouse or
58882	0	a	Yeah .
58883	0	a	Okay .
58884	0	a	Okay .
58885	0	a	But we will see .
58886	0	a	How the this remote ?
58887	0	a	Yeah , of course small .
58888	0	a	it is going to be small .
58889	0	a	Yeah .
58890	0	a	So it will beep if you want to find it
58891	0	a	you just shout y h just
58892	0	a	it just has to re respond to you when you look for the device .
58893	0	a	too small that it goes under the sofa and we ca not find it .
58894	0	a	Yeah ,
58895	0	a	that is .
58896	0	a	I dunno how bu
58897	1	a	And responds to you , and
58898	0	a	I .
58899	1	a	just give it a name and we call him .
58900	0	a	Yeah , that is right .
58901	0	a	Yeah , that is right .
58902	1	a	Okay , so next presentation
58903	0	a	Participant four .
58904	1	a	So Harry .
58905	0	a	Okay , after having the inputs from industrial design and user interface , I think most of the points which I want to are already covered here .
58906	0	a	And to find the most interesting features what the users would be interested , then what we have done is we have put a feedback forms in all the magazines , and the users send the feedbacks , and based on that These are the findings which we got
58907	0	a	and yeah
58908	0	a	adding of a speech interface is always good for a TV remote but the technology We already know that as discussed earlier An it does how feasible it is .
58909	0	a	Well I I think it will be a , yes , a bit complicated to make a speech recognisers runs on the small ts
58910	0	a	Yeah .
58911	0	a	But I think if you to recognise numbers it is a well studied problem .
58912	0	a	I if you just recognise numbers is a limited you have limited vocabulary
58913	1	a	Oh we can put an limited vocabulary as in the mobile phones .
58914	0	a	We just have the
58915	0	a	it is not going to take much space also .
58916	0	a	And this can allow to choose the the program , for instance without adding buttons
58917	0	a	so it is a good idea .
58918	0	a	Yeah .
58919	0	a	It is going to be very slim .
58920	0	a	And next one was the size of the remote control .
58921	0	a	It has to be of course a very slim and small one .
58922	0	a	And of course most of the people are interested in if it is less expensive , so this is an important criteria here is
58923	0	a	I mean we have to look for a trade off .
58924	0	a	But
58925	0	a	But do you think what they sug suggested s possibility .
58926	0	a	The features and the cost .
58927	0	a	Yeah .
58928	1	a	I
58929	1	a	no
58930	1	a	I
58931	1	a	I think that i if we go for quality people may tolerate for high quality and of course comes with reasonable cost .
58932	0	a	Yeah .
58933	1	a	Maybe not less , but they may be willing to pay little bit more for comfort ,
58934	0	a	yeah , extra features .
58935	1	a	Little bit more if it is with extra features .
58936	0	a	Yeah .
58937	0	a	It
58938	0	a	Yeah .
58939	0	a	Yeah , s s speech is a important extra feature I think
58940	0	a	Well ,
58941	0	a	we we just have to find a mean how to to add a m a a a microphone or well yes a microphone into the the remote control , so
58942	0	a	I well
58943	0	a	it will be alright .
58944	0	a	Okay .
58945	0	a	Yeah ,
58946	0	a	yeah .
58947	0	a	That is right .
58948	0	a	But is it useful or not u
58949	0	a	I do not know .
58950	0	a	Yeah .
58951	0	a	There is in the
58952	1	a	I mean , for a lazy guys they could say nine and the nine channel comes .
58953	1	a	Or they say movie name
58954	0	a	or I do not go for movie names
58955	1	a	but only for the numbers on the channel , or volume up , volume down , brightness , contrast .
58956	0	a	So , I think this should be a good idea , to put this features .
58957	0	a	And the fourth one was the teletext in various languages .
58958	0	a	, I think
58959	0	a	Yeah as discussed in the earlier meeting , but I think not much people are really interested in this point if it is not really required .
58960	0	a	I think i
58961	0	a	If it is necessary can you can do that .
58962	0	a	What is the teletext ?
58963	0	a	We can integrate small microphone in the remote
58964	0	a	so it is not really a problem .
58965	0	a	Yeah .
58966	0	a	Okay .
58967	0	a	What about lighting adaptive options ?
58968	0	a	According to the re to the new requirements I think we do not need that .
58969	0	a	Yeah .
58970	0	a	It is interesting but we are only concerned with the remote controller .
58971	0	a	So you need s special TV sets to do that ?
58972	0	a	Or it is it is done via this remote controller ?
58973	0	a	It is very complex .
58974	0	a	I mean
58975	0	a	I mean yeah , it is for the industrial design and users interface designers to decide if it is going to be working or not .
58976	0	a	Yeah , I think it is a bit complex too
58977	0	a	For our next product , our new TV set with automatical sound adjustment light
58978	0	a	I think
58979	0	a	I think as I discussed th that four points would be good for marketing .
58980	0	a	Yeah , then we can conclude that .
58981	0	a	Yeah .
58982	0	a	Yeah ,
58983	0	a	but it is quite possible but maybe not in this project .
58984	0	a	So we have I think we have s still
58985	0	a	we have couple of minutes .
58986	0	a	Mm mm .
58987	1	a	So any things to to discuss ?
58988	1	a	Or any suggestions ?
58989	0	a	Expensive .
58990	0	a	The speech interface and less reasonable cost .
58991	0	a	Price .
58992	0	a	And the lighting adaptation and the teletext .
58993	0	a	And regarding the teletext these are the subtitl these are the text information which you got on the televisions .
58994	0	a	Okay .
58995	0	a	If you are watching an foreign movie , you get subtitles sometimes .
58996	0	a	Yeah .
58997	0	a	Okay .
58998	0	a	And if you are a French guy watching an English movie you would like to have it in French .
58999	0	a	And if I am a German then I would like to have the my options in German .
59000	1	a	So , the remote it should have some it should give me some flexibility of choosing the ch languages .
59001	1	a	Function .
59002	0	a	That should be a good point .
59003	0	a	Yeah , but well what about the the new project is requirement ?
59004	1	a	I
59005	1	a	I
59006	1	a	I think we should give up with teletext , no ?
59007	0	a	Yes .
59008	0	a	I think we we can we is the .
59009	1	a	Well , so maybe we we can j we can already think about a way to to access the internet via the television .
59010	0	a	Because if
59011	0	a	Yeah , but we can think that in a few years there will be TV set that can access the internet .
59012	0	a	Using the TV to access the internet ?
59013	0	a	Or what ?
59014	0	a	I did not quite understand
59015	0	a	Yeah , okay .
59016	0	a	Yeah .
59017	0	a	So it is a good idea if i i if we i if if we think about how to to to build up our remote control w with this functionality in a w which will c which will come in a few years .
59018	0	a	We already have some .
59019	1	a	So if we already have it in our remote control
59020	0	a	Yeah .
59021	0	a	So you have to anticipate the the future ?
59022	0	a	Yeah .
59023	0	a	The future demand , market demand .
59024	0	a	Yeah .
59025	0	a	Yeah , that is right .
59026	0	a	Yeah , to desi
59027	0	a	well , not not to implement it , but to well , to find a way to to add to add this functionality in a yeah , in an in an easy manner , if is possible .
59028	0	a	The functionality in the future .
59029	0	a	In future .
59030	0	a	Alright .
59031	0	a	Yeah .
59032	0	a	Because all the TV sets will be digital , right .
59033	0	a	All the programmes , everything will be in digital than analog .
59034	0	a	Th the system will change and we have to anticipate for those change .
59035	0	a	Yeah ,
59036	0	a	yeah .
59037	0	a	Yeah , .
59038	0	a	Okay .
59039	1	a	Okay .
59040	0	a	So
59041	0	a	Okay .
59042	0	a	 
59043	0	a	So we come to the third meetings .
59044	0	a	I have
59045	0	a	good .
59046	0	a	so in the last meeting we have discussed the functional design and now we will talk about the conceptual design .
59047	0	a	So we will talk about some specific details .
59048	1	a	Okay so I think I will do my presentation on the components concept
59049	1	a	so can you please open
59050	0	a	I am participant two .
59051	0	a	Components design .
59052	0	a	This
59053	0	a	this is what we have decided in the last meeting .
59054	0	a	Okay so
59055	0	a	the first thing I have done is to to made a review together with the manufactural department and have which components was available to build a remote control .
59056	0	a	So for energy sources we have we have to choose between the solar energy , hand dynamo and kinetic well kinetic technique to to store the energy .
59057	0	a	We also we also can put a regular battery in the in the remote control .
59058	0	a	Now
59059	0	a	Yeah
59060	0	a	b f
59061	0	a	well I meant by by battery
59062	0	a	I meant I will not have a a wire between the remote control and the energy source
59063	0	a	but I did not fou
59064	0	a	we did not decide yet which kind of battery we will put inside the the remote .
59065	0	a	But if we use battery
59066	1	a	We will , okay .
59067	0	a	So it is a point to discuss .
59068	0	a	Then the case material we have also several choices , like wood , rubber , titanium or latex .
59069	0	a	But well it is not a a re well a real issue for the from the technical point of view .
59070	0	a	Concerning the interface we can we can put just simple buttons or scrolls or buttons much more complicated , but it also requires that the chip to process the button is more complicated so .
59071	0	a	And this is the last point , the choice of chips .
59072	0	a	So what I have f found is that I think basic battery or kinetic energy collection is the is the better way to provide energy because I think solar energy wi wo not work in a cluttered environment .
59073	0	a	So so I think we can start with these two main things .
59074	0	a	For the case well I think that titanium is is a good choice because it is trendy and
59075	0	a	it is it is well
59076	0	a	it is modern and user are are are will be very happy to have a a a nice remote .
59077	0	a	For the interface I think that we can ach achieve all the desired functionalities by s just using rubber buttons , simple buttons and th thus this allow to use a regular chip that are well cheaper .
59078	1	a	And s so we can move to the next slide .
59079	0	a	Sorry .
59080	0	a	Yeah .
59081	0	a	What is this single curved what does it mean ?
59082	0	a	So it is it is not
59083	0	a	Yo l
59084	0	a	yeah .
59085	0	a	Well i i it is it is the the shape of the of the remote .
59086	0	a	You you will have the well the the curve will fit into your hand when you grab the
59087	0	a	Yeah .
59088	0	a	When you hold on it , it is comfortable to hold .
59089	0	a	It is more confog f comfortable that if these it is completely flat .
59090	0	a	Okay .
59091	0	a	Yeah .
59092	0	a	And the battery , is it kind of a rechargeable or it does not matter ?
59093	0	a	That that is what it means by kinetic .
59094	0	a	Yeah the that is the point .
59095	0	a	The kinetic one is y you can recharge by the
59096	0	a	Yeah
59097	0	a	and by well by just by moving the ar your arm the well the remote will accumulate energy .
59098	0	a	Okay .
59099	0	a	Okay .
59100	0	a	But I d I do not know it is if it is feasible because I do not know
59101	0	a	if yet if if the user will move enough to provide the remote all the necessary energy .
59102	0	a	Okay .
59103	0	a	Yeah .
59104	0	a	Yeah .
59105	1	a	We we might check with our R and D department to see if they have this product ready for market .
59106	0	a	Yeah .
59107	0	a	And yeah and
59108	1	a	so can you go to the next slide please .
59109	0	a	So and that is that summarize well what I have said .
59110	0	a	So you are right
59111	0	a	we can see in our R and D if the kinetic metal is sufficient to provide enough energy .
59112	0	a	Wha
59113	0	a	the department .
59114	0	a	That is it .
59115	0	a	So I keep in touch with the R and D department .
59116	0	a	Oh yeah
59117	0	a	I take care ,
59118	0	a	it is all right .
59119	0	a	So the titanium case is the normal case that
59120	1	a	I will show you some pictures that I have
59121	1	a	and you tell me whether they are titanium case or not .
59122	1	a	All right .
59123	0	a	Cause I am not very sure , plastic , titanium or whatever .
59124	1	a	Yeah .
59125	1	a	There is another point I want to make ,
59126	0	a	is that the well you have seen them I le na my presentation that I point out some why buttons are not the not the only ways you can use
59127	1	a	Yeah .
59128	1	a	Yeah , maybe n
59129	0	a	Yeah .
59130	0	a	Three .
59131	0	a	So the user interface is i it uses the aspect of a computer system , a programme which can be seen or heard or otherwise perceived by the human user and the commands and mechanism the user uses to control its operation and input data .
59132	0	a	So you s
59133	0	a	this gives you the ways to input data
59134	0	a	and we have we are more
59135	0	a	we emphasise more on the graphical user interface here .
59136	0	a	The idea is to represent buttons as figures , diagrams , symbols and on
59137	0	a	so you
59138	0	a	you can easily when you look at the symbols you understand what it is doing .
59139	0	a	What is the function of this button .
59140	0	a	Yeah .
59141	0	a	Yeah .
59142	0	a	So .
59143	0	a	I think it makes the the interface really
59144	0	a	Graphical user interface .
59145	0	a	Ea easy to use .
59146	1	a	So next one .
59147	0	a	function five .
59148	1	a	So I can use the button , the mouse maybe .
59149	0	a	A graphical user interface emphasise the use of pictures .
59150	0	a	Yeah .
59151	1	a	So next line .
59152	0	a	So the here are some examples .
59153	0	a	So they cluster the buttons together .
59154	0	a	They group them into col they colour them and they have different forms as well .
59155	0	a	but this interface are kind of confusing .
59156	0	a	basically there are too many buttons .
59157	1	a	Right .
59158	1	a	Next one .
59159	0	a	Yeah .
59160	0	a	So some people are propose voice recognition
59161	0	a	and so
59162	0	a	by the way I receive an email from the from one our departments saying that the voice recognition has been used in the coffee machine for this by a company when you tell the you say good morning coffee machine and the machine are reply to you .
59163	0	a	So I just got an email saying that .
59164	0	a	And it seems like this voice recognition technology is ready to be used
59165	1	a	so we might consider that , supposedly .
59166	0	a	Yeah fine .
59167	1	a	The next one .
59168	0	a	so somebody some people use some people use a spinning wheel th with the LC display so instead of using the buttons you have a LCD screen and then there you can u you can use that as buttons , you can use that as real so so that could be an option as well .
59169	0	a	Touch screen , I mean .
59170	0	a	Yeah .
59171	1	a	Next one .
59172	0	a	And some people propose a scroll button .
59173	0	a	Integrated with push buttons or you may have scroll button instead of p just the push button .
59174	0	a	Like the one we have here .
59175	1	a	, next one .
59176	0	a	So
59177	0	a	so there are a few aspects that I collected here .
59178	0	a	So s basically this deals with special users , children , handicapped people , old people ,
59179	0	a	and and prog
59180	0	a	basically they are programmable , specially for children .
59181	0	a	And
59182	0	a	yeah yeah .
59183	0	a	And then they also secure covers , to protect secure and hidden programming and battery covers that will protect your settings .
59184	0	a	So
59185	0	a	But we do not have to integrate all these complicated features .
59186	0	a	I am just saying that the currently in the market there are there are control there are remote controllers f customisable for different people .
59187	0	a	Yeah , so that is the point .
59188	1	a	The next one .
59189	0	a	And you see this is the one where you have the protection cover .
59190	1	a	maybe useful for children ,
59191	0	a	they migh you you
59192	0	a	they only see the buttons outside .
59193	0	a	And for adults wh where you have more control you can see the one inside .
59194	1	a	So the adults might want to have a key to lock that to pr so children will not touch the button inside .
59195	0	a	Yeah .
59196	0	a	Yeah .
59197	0	a	S a good idea .
59198	1	a	The next one .
59199	0	a	So this guy
59200	0	a	this is another company that provides big buttons .
59201	0	a	At
59202	0	a	I see that that is useful for old people and then you do not get it lost .
59203	0	a	But for our product we do not need a big one because you have voice recognition e eventually with use .
59204	0	a	Yeah .
59205	0	a	And you can call your remote controller if you do not know where it is .
59206	0	a	TV remote controller where are you ?
59207	0	a	And then , he will beeps and to say that I am here , for example .
59208	0	a	Is it possible ?
59209	0	a	Yeah .
59210	1	a	We should include speech synthesis in this case , no ?
59211	0	a	Yeah .
59212	0	a	Yeah .
59213	0	a	Yeah
59214	0	a	but as Norman say if there is already a commercial product available who t who do this we we can check to integrate it i into our new remote control .
59215	0	a	Yeah .
59216	0	a	Yeah .
59217	0	a	Yeah .
59218	0	a	Yeah .
59219	0	a	And , this is another one
59220	0	a	where you can
59221	0	a	the the the part that is a V standing for the volume .
59222	0	a	So there is a up arrow and a down arrow .
59223	0	a	But you the see that in the V , the V appears to be the down arrow on the top
59224	0	a	on the top up arrow if you
59225	0	a	up arrow there is a V like as as if it is turning down
59226	0	a	so it is confusing interface ,
59227	0	a	so I want to avoid this kind of thing in the design .
59228	0	a	Yeah yeah .
59229	0	a	And here are is here is a s short summary that I summary that I compiled after the findings I found .
59230	0	a	Big buttons are convenient , voice recognition helps , push buttons , scroll buttons , spinning wheels can be used as navigation tools .
59231	0	a	And user customisable is important and finally simplicity simplicity is the key .
59232	0	a	Yeah .
59233	0	a	So
59234	0	a	we have many concepts there
59235	0	a	but we have to choose later on which ones are important to be used .
59236	0	a	Yeah .
59237	0	a	And basically
59238	0	a	Yeah .
59239	0	a	Well I I think you it is
59240	0	a	it is it is fine you have reviewed all all the possibilities
59241	0	a	but well i if we consider that the user interface is displayed on the TV screen I do not think we nee
59242	0	a	we need much buttons in the remote since we we just have to navigate and to have a okay or enter key or things like that , because adding wheels or scrolls makes the thing more complicated and more expensive also ,
59243	0	a	so .
59244	0	a	Yeah .
59245	0	a	Okay .
59246	1	a	Or maybe we can include the user manual in the in the remote control and we should have just a button like help and you say and you ik you press the button help and maybe you see the the user m might in the in the TV .
59247	0	a	Yeah .
59248	0	a	That is a good idea .
59249	0	a	To have a help button .
59250	0	a	A help button .
59251	0	a	Yeah .
59252	0	a	Yeah .
59253	0	a	So you are display on the screen .
59254	0	a	On the TV screen .
59255	0	a	On TV TV screen .
59256	0	a	So on the TV screen .
59257	0	a	On the TV screen the how to use your remote .
59258	0	a	So just you push the button
59259	0	a	and we will
59260	0	a	Yeah .
59261	0	a	Okay .
59262	0	a	Okay .
59263	0	a	Oh .
59264	0	a	Okay .
59265	0	a	So that eliminates all the complicated documentation ,
59266	0	a	okay .
59267	0	a	So wi
59268	0	a	Yeah .
59269	0	a	But people are often enough looking at the help , once they see the help button they say oh this is a complicated stuff .
59270	0	a	If the if
59271	0	a	No
59272	0	a	In the case where they need help , in the case where they need help .
59273	0	a	yeah .
59274	0	a	It is a psychology .
59275	0	a	In a marketing point of view .
59276	0	a	Okay .
59277	1	a	And let us see what the market demands .
59278	1	a	We could just go to my presentation .
59279	0	a	Yeah .
59280	0	a	But wel well I think
59281	0	a	well .
59282	0	a	It is just for user customizable , for kids or old people .
59283	0	a	Yeah that is right .
59284	0	a	I mean it just showed us the remote with an cap which could be used for kids
59285	1	a	and if you remove the
59286	0	a	Same remote with some
59287	0	a	Both
59288	0	a	yeah .
59289	0	a	So
59290	0	a	So it is the same
59291	0	a	Can be used by both kids and old people .
59292	1	a	Well what I s propose is that you know a remote controller , i it could be a cube , is a small device that looks like a cube and maybe you can just change the the buttons , if you ch turn one side
59293	1	a	you get one one buttons , you turn the other side you get the other buttons , so for maybe new generation people who get used to the computer they want lots of controls .
59294	1	a	Maybe for kids ,
59295	0	a	kids they like
59296	0	a	t no l
59297	0	a	they like to
59298	0	a	Yeah .
59299	0	a	Small
59300	0	a	Yeah .
59301	1	a	So le le let is see what what people want .
59302	1	a	Let is see the market demand .
59303	1	a	And then we can decide what what we can
59304	1	a	yeah .
59305	0	a	What what market
59306	0	a	yes yes .
59307	0	a	So we just made an marketing survey of what people need from our remotes and how it could be special from the other remotes .
59308	0	a	And we got the best on the responses from the questionnaires .
59309	0	a	we also have some prizes for the most creative solutions .
59310	0	a	And we found the following solutions which we could which would be helpful for our design .
59311	0	a	So seventy percent of the users , they find their remote controls very ugly , they do not find it pleasant to use in the size or usage or anything .
59312	0	a	And eighty percent of the people they are always l
59313	0	a	I mean they are willing to spend more money if the remote control would look fancy .
59314	0	a	And the current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour of the user .
59315	0	a	And seventy five percent of the users said they zap a lot .
59316	0	a	And fifty percent say they use only ten percent of the buttons , so the rest of the ninety percent of the buttons they are not used most of the times .
59317	0	a	Yeah .
59318	0	a	Yeah .
59319	0	a	Yes .
59320	0	a	So this were the findings which we found .
59321	0	a	And also they cited frustrations with the present remote controls .
59322	0	a	Most of
59323	0	a	fifty percent of the time the remote controls are lost somewhere in the room and people are always searching for them rather than watching the TV .
59324	0	a	Yeah .
59325	0	a	And by the time they found the remote control the program is finished .
59326	0	a	So they are frustrated a lot
59327	0	a	And if the remote control is too complicated it takes much time to learn the functionality of it .
59328	0	a	Yeah .
59329	0	a	, the functionalities
59330	0	a	yeah .
59331	0	a	So you can just see the percentage , fifty percent people
59332	0	a	they responded that they always lose their remotes and thirty four percent
59333	0	a	they say that it is quite difficult to learn if it is too complex .
59334	0	a	Yeah .
59335	0	a	So keeping in view all these findings and the frustrations I think this should be the solution for them .
59336	0	a	We should have an LCD on the rem remote control .
59337	0	a	Oh .
59338	0	a	Well w well I
59339	0	a	I
59340	0	a	I do not really see the advantage of having LCD on the on the remote control if we have a a a big screen and display on the screen .
59341	0	a	Big screen .
59342	0	a	It is
59343	0	a	yeah of course it is fancy trendy and so on
59344	0	a	but it is it is expensive to produce
59345	0	a	and it is not really
59346	0	a	Yeah .
59347	0	a	I mean as our survey says that people are willing to pay more if their remotes are fancy .
59348	0	a	So if we have a LCD on the remote , rather than looking onto the TV you just look into a remote and navigate it .
59349	0	a	It is the same menu as we have saw that iPod remote control .
59350	0	a	yeah .
59351	0	a	Yeah yeah .
59352	0	a	We just play around
59353	0	a	Yeah .
59354	0	a	The thing
59355	0	a	Yeah .
59356	0	a	Yeah but when you play with the iPod you do not have a big screen in front of you , s
59357	0	a	Yeah .
59358	0	a	You can use this screen instead of the big se screen ,
59359	0	a	instead of use the yeah .
59360	0	a	Yeah .
59361	0	a	Yeah .
59362	0	a	If you re use the existing screen , we element eliminate the LCD , after all the LCD just to display and if you have the colourful screen you can make the display colourful , fancy , as fancy as the one on the LCD , maybe even better .
59363	0	a	Yeah .
59364	0	a	So
59365	0	a	Yeah .
59366	0	a	I mean this were the points which we got from the market demands .
59367	0	a	Yeah .
59368	0	a	Yeah yeah .
59369	0	a	So
59370	0	a	Yeah that is fine .
59371	0	a	Yeah .
59372	0	a	So I th
59373	0	a	I
59374	0	a	I
59375	1	a	well I think we we can focus on the on the fancy look
59376	0	a	on the
59377	0	a	on the speech recognition if the technology is available but well I think LCD will will make us spend a lot of money for not so big results .
59378	0	a	Yeah .
59379	1	a	More on a fancy design .
59380	0	a	Yeah .
59381	0	a	I mean that is
59382	0	a	Yeah .
59383	0	a	Remember we have a s budget for the cost of producing the remote controller .
59384	0	a	But
59385	0	a	Yeah .
59386	0	a	Yeah .
59387	0	a	yeah we have
59388	0	a	I mean that should be found out by the Industrial Designers .
59389	0	a	So i is
59390	1	a	so the thing is you can find out how much an LCD will cost
59391	1	a	and then we will decide again .
59392	1	a	maybe you can find out the price and tell us next time .
59393	1	a	So price of LCD display .
59394	0	a	Is i if i
59395	0	a	Yeah .
59396	0	a	And it is always good to have an voice recognition for the remote controls .
59397	0	a	And
59398	0	a	Yeah .
59399	0	a	Yeah .
59400	1	a	And also the cost for the speech recognition .
59401	1	a	Ask our R and D department .
59402	0	a	It is for
59403	0	a	it is just for small vocabulary .
59404	0	a	Yeah .
59405	0	a	Yeah it is o only for a limited vocabulary , say eighty commands or so .
59406	0	a	We it is not
59407	0	a	yeah .
59408	0	a	Yeah .
59409	0	a	And ho
59410	0	a	Yeah .
59411	0	a	Yeah .
59412	0	a	Yeah okay .
59413	1	a	And also the scroller button , how much will it cost .
59414	0	a	And
59415	0	a	Well compared to the to s the simpl simpler simplest button .
59416	0	a	Yeah .
59417	0	a	, the scroll button ,
59418	0	a	from the survey we never see that people would like to have some scrolling button .
59419	0	a	Push push .
59420	0	a	Yeah .
59421	0	a	Because they they just they are just frightened to use the scrollings or help button .
59422	0	a	Yeah I think that
59423	0	a	Yeah
59424	0	a	I
59425	0	a	I
59426	0	a	I think that well as we have seen in the in the presentation well about fifty percent of the of the percent n choose the button
59427	0	a	so I think to have five simple button is sufficient for our functionality .
59428	0	a	Yeah .
59429	0	a	Do not use the buttons .
59430	0	a	Yeah .
59431	0	a	Yeah .
59432	0	a	Yeah .
59433	0	a	Yeah .
59434	0	a	Yeah .
59435	0	a	It does not mean that the other buttons are not necessary or important .
59436	0	a	Important .
59437	0	a	Yeah .
59438	0	a	But
59439	1	a	But the the thing is is
59440	1	a	i is that we can add a functionality on the on the TV screen like a a list of function
59441	1	a	and then you choose with the with the button to well you navigate
59442	0	a	and you
59443	0	a	Yeah .
59444	0	a	But they are just less used compar
59445	0	a	yeah .
59446	0	a	They are not used much .
59447	0	a	Yeah .
59448	0	a	Yeah .
59449	0	a	Yeah ,
59450	0	a	yeah .
59451	1	a	So so the at most more power .
59452	1	a	Or maybe we can u
59453	1	a	or maybe we can make this the ten percent of button more bigger than the others .
59454	0	a	So .
59455	0	a	But if i i if we if we could have a a a display g a user interface that is very complete on the TV screen
59456	0	a	I think that just five buttons are sufficient ,
59457	1	a	one to go up left right down and enter and
59458	1	a	you you
59459	1	a	you just select the functionality you want to access or things like that .
59460	0	a	Yep .
59461	0	a	Yeah .
59462	0	a	Yeah .
59463	0	a	You do not have to to switch to a channel to another
59464	0	a	Yeah
59465	0	a	but
59466	0	a	Yeah but if you look at the LCD
59467	0	a	you you do not look at the TV screen
59468	0	a	so i i it is not really worth to get to have the image if you do not look at , so .
59469	0	a	Yeah .
59470	1	a	Or it could be like this , as the people say , if they have a LCD on the remote not on the television .
59471	0	a	Because when you have the LCD onto the television screen you miss the picture in the background , we are most focused on the commands .
59472	1	a	So if you have then LCD in the remote , you just have a menu , and increasing and lower these signs here to change the programs and this menu when you press the menu , in the LCD displays as you go on pressing the menu it faster displays volume , then the program , then the brightness , contrast and all the stuff .
59473	1	a	And accordingly you can just increase or decrease .
59474	0	a	It is
59475	0	a	And I think it is increases the cost of the the remote control if you use LCD .
59476	0	a	I if
59477	0	a	Yeah .
59478	0	a	Yeah .
59479	0	a	Yeah
59480	1	a	that has to be checked out .
59481	0	a	I think that there is no contradiction here ,
59482	0	a	because if there are few buttons , you do not have to look at your your controller any more because you know where the buttons are , so if you want to control the screen d sh sharpness
59483	0	a	you just say sharpness
59484	0	a	and then you t turn you just press lef increase or decrease button and the same for the volume and the channel ,
59485	0	a	if you had the speech recognition there you just shout your channel , just tell your channel
59486	0	a	and then you do not even have to look at the butto at the controller so finally that wil eliminates the the need for LCD , with the help of speech recogniser
59487	0	a	you can
59488	0	a	Yeah .
59489	0	a	I
59490	1	a	You will listen to a peep , special peep .
59491	0	a	Yeah .
59492	0	a	Yeah .
59493	0	a	Okay .
59494	1	a	I mean , better if we could just check all the cost with LCD and also with the speech recognition .
59495	0	a	Yeah .
59496	0	a	And then we could find which would would be a more suitable in this case .
59497	0	a	Yeah .
59498	0	a	A and
59499	0	a	And the third problem was to find the remote control .
59500	0	a	Always , so fifty percent of the people say they lose the remotes .
59501	1	a	Well so we we can think about a well a a vocal command like find and when the remote control hears fine well
59502	1	a	yeah
59503	1	a	just to make him beep or t
59504	0	a	Yeah .
59505	0	a	Yeah that is right ,
59506	0	a	that is exactly what I mean by voice commander .
59507	1	a	Where ,
59508	0	a	yeah .
59509	1	a	Or it could be also something like this ,
59510	0	a	it is always boring to change the batteries of the remotes control ,
59511	1	a	so we have some one charger there
59512	1	a	and whenever we do not use the remote control we put it in the charger .
59513	0	a	Yeah .
59514	0	a	Yeah .
59515	1	a	Put it back at the charge .
59516	0	a	Put
59517	0	a	Yeah .
59518	0	a	Yeah .
59519	1	a	And when we are using that t remote and if we misplace somewhere , in the charger we have a small button , and just by pressing the button in the charger the remote control beeps , wherever it is .
59520	0	a	Yeah .
59521	0	a	Okay .
59522	0	a	And that is a good idea , that is simple , like in phones .
59523	0	a	Yeah .
59524	0	a	I mean it doe it also does not require a voice command , because there are problems with a voice command .
59525	0	a	Yeah .
59526	0	a	But you do not you do not have to move the the charger .
59527	0	a	Yeah ,
59528	0	a	yeah ,
59529	0	a	yeah .
59530	0	a	I mean charger would be fixed because it is always with electricity plugged .
59531	0	a	Th
59532	0	a	yeah .
59533	0	a	You have to keep it .
59534	0	a	Yeah .
59535	0	a	yeah .
59536	1	a	Yeah if there if there there is nuff not enough battery .
59537	0	a	Yeah .
59538	0	a	Okay .
59539	0	a	There is .
59540	1	a	Also and the remote is lost .
59541	0	a	Yeah .
59542	0	a	Yeah that is right .
59543	0	a	That we can
59544	1	a	what we can do is we can program a function whereby when you press the switch off TV button , the off button , the remote there be s instruction on the screen , please charge charge me .
59545	0	a	Yeah .
59546	0	a	You never get it lost
59547	1	a	because every time you are off the computer the TV you are asked the the command the TV com remote controller would tell you to put it back to where to the charger .
59548	0	a	It is an good reminder , yeah that is right .
59549	0	a	Yeah .
59550	0	a	So you will never get lost
59551	0	a	yeah .
59552	0	a	Okay .
59553	0	a	Maybe for some people lazy people .
59554	0	a	Yeah .
59555	0	a	Yeah
59556	0	a	because everything is programmed inside .
59557	0	a	Yeah yeah .
59558	0	a	So it is it is it is all about strategy , y
59559	0	a	And of course the final point is a fancy look .
59560	0	a	As we have seen earlier the remotes which were displayed by Norman they were not fancy ,
59561	0	a	I mean very big or something with lot of buttons .
59562	0	a	They were ugly .
59563	0	a	They
59564	0	a	Well the last one with the yeah with the two parts was original , so
59565	0	a	Yeah .
59566	0	a	Yeah ,
59567	0	a	yeah .
59568	0	a	I think we should have something it
59569	0	a	I mean I mean I mean you see if it is like that even a kid who wants to have a control he could just plug it and use it
59570	0	a	, you ca not avoid him .
59571	0	a	With two two two parts controller .
59572	1	a	But you can have an button for child lock .
59573	0	a	Yeah .
59574	0	a	Yeah .
59575	1	a	So just by pressing the button with some code , you t you put a lock onto the remote , so that he ca not use even
59576	0	a	That is right .
59577	1	a	Well we can think about having on the on the on the user interface when you switch on the TV you can well write a code or choose a category , if it is kids , things like that .
59578	0	a	Or
59579	1	a	Or maybe you have to to show some specific programmes for kids
59580	1	a	and then just just yeah just push kids button
59581	1	a	so it is automatically
59582	0	a	Yeah .
59583	0	a	these are probl
59584	0	a	yeah .
59585	0	a	So if he .
59586	0	a	I think these other four points they are the market demands
59587	0	a	and so it is for the user interface design and industrial design to just think
59588	0	a	Yeah
59589	0	a	I think it should be clearer for us in the next meeting that th these could be included .
59590	0	a	So for
59591	0	a	yeah .
59592	0	a	Yeah .
59593	1	a	So for my part I will check the prices the the prices difference of what to use , where to use , and s and so on .
59594	0	a	Yeah .
59595	1	a	I think we need to define also a s the set of vocabularies for the speech recogniser
59596	0	a	because if you want say we can sort by channels or sort by TV programs , you have to decide a category of vocabularies for them .
59597	0	a	Yeah .
59598	0	a	If numbers , they are easy , but if name the channel by by name
59599	1	a	Well I think we can we can have just numbers for channels
59600	1	a	and you can say to your remote control like sports and then on the TV you have a list with with well with sports program playing now
59601	0	a	and and
59602	0	a	That is right , yeah
59603	0	a	, yeah .
59604	0	a	No ,
59605	0	a	we have a problem there .
59606	0	a	You see if you have a voice commands and you are s you are watching a score on basketball score or something , and if the score comes twenty four thirty five , you have just say twenty five and suddenly the screen the channel goes to twenty five .
59607	0	a	Yeah it is
59608	0	a	yeah .
59609	1	a	So I think there should be a prefix to some numbers
59610	0	a	I mean the the you just check all the probability that saying TV twenty five and just ordinary twenty five .
59611	0	a	Well but well e every possible word has a probability to come about of the TV so .
59612	0	a	Yeah .
59613	0	a	Yeah yeah .
59614	0	a	Ordinary twenty five you almost there is a probability of being said around sixty seventy percent and TV twenty five
59615	0	a	I dunno it will be round about one or two percent .
59616	0	a	Yeah but well
59617	0	a	okay .
59618	0	a	So it is better to have some prefix before the number .
59619	0	a	But I I I think that the user would like wou would like to associate the channel or call the channel rather than than the numbers .
59620	0	a	Yeah something , some code .
59621	0	a	You say numbe channel number five of the TV correspond to something else in the channel .
59622	0	a	Yeah yeah .
59623	1	a	So some people may want to say , I want to see this channel .
59624	0	a	Well I
59625	0	a	Yeah .
59626	0	a	That will be too big .
59627	0	a	And it will be difficult for the vocabulary also .
59628	0	a	Or just
59629	0	a	It is difficult to to just say the the name of the channel .
59630	0	a	Yeah .
59631	1	a	Check with the v R and D department the capability of recogniser .
59632	0	a	Well , it is convenient for the user .
59633	0	a	It will be difficult to say just the name of the channel .
59634	0	a	Because you have to s t a ch
59635	0	a	yeah
59636	0	a	but you have to to have all the name of the channel in your vocabulary .
59637	0	a	Als might be you just forgot the channel name , you kno only know the number .
59638	0	a	Or maybe
59639	1	a	Or maybe the user can create his own vocabulary , just pronouncing the the name of channels and include in the vocabulary .
59640	0	a	Then Yeah , the .
59641	0	a	The .
59642	0	a	I
59643	0	a	I think that I have
59644	1	a	I think there is another way you can do is that you can if when the user ch press a button to choose the channel for example , then what you can do is that the you can make the TV screen to split them into small little little squares of images where you you you have a snapshot of every channel , so let is say it is a four by four matrix of the images , so now what you do is f looking at the all the sixteen channels available at one time , you just use the control button , you
59645	1	a	just you
59646	1	a	you just choose the the option you want
59647	1	a	and then you just hit the button
59648	1	a	and then you go to that channel .
59649	0	a	So
59650	1	a	Or lets the user create his own vocabulary of channel .
59651	0	a	So you you do not use the speech recogniser in that way .
59652	0	a	No .
59653	1	a	Just you have in the beginning you have t
59654	1	a	you have to train you have to create the vocabulary by yourself .
59655	0	a	Oh , okay .
59656	0	a	Yeah .
59657	0	a	Well I I also
59658	0	a	I I also think about another problem , if if there is more than one person who is watching TV
59659	0	a	the s well
59660	0	a	the the speech r recogniser should be able to distinguish between the two .
59661	1	a	By associating each channel with the name or And for each one has his own .
59662	0	a	Yeah yeah ,
59663	0	a	Because I remember when I was a young child with my sister
59664	0	a	we
59665	0	a	yeah
59666	0	a	we always want to w to watch different emission at the at the same time
59667	0	a	so it is a pr it could be a problem if if well if someone passes by when you are watching TV and say oh TV thirty and just run , s
59668	0	a	Yeah ,
59669	0	a	yeah .
59670	0	a	Or you have to s
59671	0	a	Yeah .
59672	0	a	Yeah , I want to watch this , I want to watch that .
59673	0	a	Yeah .
59674	0	a	A and in the same lines we would have a one more problem .
59675	0	a	If we are using the television in the different environments , say in the factories or in the shops where there is a lot of noise and this voice commands if they fail to work , that would bring a bad name bad reputation for our company .
59676	1	a	So I think we should specify some pre requirements if we want to use a voice commands , say that it should be used in an silent homely environment or s something .
59677	0	a	Yeah .
59678	1	a	Or we can switch on or switch off the the special , yeah .
59679	0	a	Yeah that is right
59680	0	a	that should be an option .
59681	0	a	Yeah that is
59682	0	a	well I think that is a good a good option
59683	0	a	because it is simple and simple to implement also , so .
59684	0	a	I think these are the practical problems .
59685	0	a	So we need to take care of them in the design .
59686	1	a	Maybe we will discuss them in next meeting .
59687	0	a	It is time to close this meeting .
59688	0	a	Okay .
59689	0	a	Okay .
59690	0	a	Oh it came there on three minutes back
59691	0	a	so we are
59692	1	a	I think we can just press the okay .
59693	0	a	Yeah .
59694	0	a	Okay .
59695	0	a	Okay .
59696	0	a	Okay .
59697	0	a	 
59698	0	a	So in last meeting we have discussed the conceptual design and we asked you to prepare a prototype for the for the remote control .
59699	0	a	So .
59700	0	a	Okay .
59701	1	a	So let is see the what did you prepare .
59702	0	a	Yeah ,
59703	1	a	so can you go out to the shared folder ?
59704	0	a	the shared folder .
59705	0	a	Sh share folder for th your presentation ?
59706	0	a	Because I have here
59707	0	a	Okay just one .
59708	0	a	Yes .
59709	0	a	We have a presentation .
59710	0	a	So I got the participant three .
59711	0	a	W .
59712	0	a	Three .
59713	0	a	It is the final design ,
59714	0	a	yeah .
59715	0	a	S
59716	0	a	so so I discussed with Guillaume .
59717	0	a	Right .
59718	0	a	Yeah .
59719	0	a	And so we have
59720	0	a	and we we are both agreed on some two versions of the prototypes , because we were no not decided whether we wanted to have an LCD or not because it is too expensive .
59721	0	a	So we come up with two versions .
59722	0	a	One with and one without LCDs .
59723	0	a	but both comes with a charger and then detachable and or control module .
59724	0	a	And detachable big buttons for all people .
59725	0	a	So .
59726	1	a	S
59727	1	a	okay
59728	1	a	so I will show you the the two prototypes .
59729	0	a	Here we have the first one with the beautiful LCD display .
59730	0	a	You you can s here .
59731	0	a	And you can just browse into the the navigation menu by joystick joystick like button .
59732	0	a	You can choose the direction and if you just push on it it is considered like a enter function .
59733	0	a	You have on the on the side here the microphone for the for the speech recognition system here .
59734	0	a	And here the the switch that control if you want
59735	0	a	Well I I
59736	0	a	I think it is the Yeah
59737	0	a	but
59738	0	a	Yeah .
59739	0	a	Why you why you you put it in the the side ?
59740	0	a	It is not a good place maybe .
59741	0	a	No
59742	0	a	i i
59743	0	a	it is the all around camer microphone is not it .
59744	0	a	The the microphone picks up the speeches from anywhere .
59745	0	a	Is it an only a single mic or a microphone array ?
59746	0	a	Well so it is a microphone array .
59747	0	a	Oh it is very costly , microphone array .
59748	0	a	No
59749	0	a	it is just a single microphone ,
59750	0	a	and you
59751	0	a	I
59752	0	a	I think we we put it here because I think when you when you are browsing your LCD you will be close to well it is better to to to place it here th than here , for instance .
59753	0	a	Yeah .
59754	0	a	Yeah .
59755	0	a	Yeah yeah .
59756	0	a	Okay .
59757	0	a	And here is a little switch that control if you want the the speaker recognition system to to be on or off .
59758	0	a	And so this remote control comes up with its charger .
59759	0	a	How much does it cost this one ?
59760	0	a	Fifteen dollars ?
59761	0	a	it is above it is above the budget .
59762	0	a	Well this this prototype is made for about well fi fi fifteen fifteen dollars fifteen dollars ,
59763	0	a	but well it is not it is not
59764	0	a	yeah ,
59765	0	a	but it is just a prototype and if we if we optimises the the voila .
59766	0	a	For the
59767	0	a	Yeah .
59768	0	a	The cost would be le reduced .
59769	0	a	Yeah
59770	0	a	the and the the production costs
59771	0	a	we we can achieve about ten dollars .
59772	0	a	How many b battery is there ?
59773	0	a	Battery .
59774	0	a	How many , excuse me ?
59775	0	a	Well f battery , we use about
59776	0	a	Yeah .
59777	0	a	Is it n the two AAs batteries in it .
59778	0	a	AA rechargeable batteries .
59779	0	a	Rechargeable of course , because we have the charger .
59780	0	a	Yeah rechargeable batteries .
59781	0	a	We have the charger so it is no problem .
59782	0	a	Yeah and you just
59783	0	a	On yeah one battery .
59784	0	a	So one one battery ?
59785	0	a	It is kinetic reserve .
59786	0	a	Is that two or one ?
59787	0	a	Now what is the whole day rating for that ?
59788	0	a	Whole day is rating .
59789	0	a	Actually it is a flexible thing .
59790	0	a	You just
59791	0	a	n
59792	0	a	Yeah yeah .
59793	0	a	The
59794	0	a	excuse me ?
59795	0	a	Oh yeah
59796	0	a	it is just a r simple battery a rechargeable
59797	0	a	if you like it is exist .
59798	0	a	What type of battery ?
59799	0	a	Something like a two A , A three size batteries ?
59800	0	a	Yeah .
59801	0	a	Yeah .
59802	0	a	So and if you want to charge the battery you just put the remote control like that to plug in the the charger and leave it alone , it is alright .
59803	0	a	Yeah .
59804	0	a	Yeah .
59805	0	a	Then the next time you pick it , oh it works .
59806	0	a	At yeah .
59807	0	a	I forgot to tell you there is only a single button there ,
59808	0	a	b this button
59809	0	a	yeah alright .
59810	1	a	Yeah just explain the button Norman .
59811	0	a	This button is like the mouse is like a joystick , you can move in three hundred and sixty degrees of direction
59812	0	a	so you can make a turn and it the additi functions associated to all the actions you ma you have a click you have a double click all in a single button .
59813	0	a	You can move up , down , left , right , or you can do a swing .
59814	0	a	So a swing to the left , a swing to the right defines other functions .
59815	0	a	So even though it is a single button , but it is pretty s flexible because of the three hundred and sixty degree movement .
59816	0	a	And the LCD is this one , on the remote ?
59817	0	a	Yeah .
59818	0	a	Yeah .
59819	0	a	Yep .
59820	0	a	This is the version y that comes with LCD .
59821	1	a	Here I present another version without the LCD .
59822	0	a	I think it is not a good idea
59823	0	a	because after maybe one or two months of function is getting destroyed .
59824	0	a	If you
59825	0	a	okay this is new prototype .
59826	0	a	Yeah it is
59827	0	a	So we have the the second version also with the different button configuration .
59828	0	a	The second version is also simpler , we d we had just I have to put the microphone also .
59829	0	a	So basically th it is the same
59830	0	a	yeah .
59831	0	a	Uh huh and also the switch .
59832	0	a	Yeah yeah .
59833	0	a	Okay .
59834	0	a	Basically it is the same things as I presented before .
59835	0	a	But here we have we have four buttons for navigation .
59836	0	a	Press one button acting as a a enter button .
59837	0	a	So yeah
59838	0	a	according to what you said it is more robust to the user .
59839	0	a	And it is also cheaper to produce .
59840	0	a	We can produce such remote control for about four dollars .
59841	0	a	No four dollars , it is good .
59842	0	a	And I think you forgot a point here to have an button to find the charger , because that is a major that is a
59843	0	a	Okay
59844	0	a	and if you disable speech recognition system then ?
59845	0	a	Oh no
59846	0	a	th actually th we will come to that point in our
59847	0	a	Yeah .
59848	0	a	Yeah
59849	0	a	it is it is it is embed in the speech recognition system .
59850	0	a	So
59851	0	a	so Norman will explain to you .
59852	0	a	W w I will I will come to that point later on .
59853	0	a	And we will we will serve the charger with this ?
59854	0	a	With the remote control .
59855	0	a	Yeah .
59856	0	a	Okay .
59857	0	a	Yeah
59858	0	a	yeah of course .
59859	0	a	Th they either these with the the the charger any
59860	0	a	in either versions you
59861	0	a	they
59862	0	a	they
59863	0	a	ha they use the same charger
59864	0	a	yeah .
59865	0	a	Okay
59866	0	a	so the price of the charger included in the
59867	0	a	it is a standard module so you should get it for a cheap price .
59868	0	a	Thank thank you .
59869	0	a	And so .
59870	0	a	It is that same charger that you can use for the hand phone but again depends on the types .
59871	1	a	I think we have to investigate more on that , but
59872	0	a	Yeah .
59873	0	a	The price should be below twelve and a half Euro .
59874	0	a	Yeah
59875	0	a	but as the Marketing Manager says , people is willing to people are willing to pay more for good design .
59876	0	a	Well that is so
59877	0	a	We have we have just
59878	0	a	The price of selling is twenty five Euros .
59879	0	a	Yeah people are willing to pay more ,
59880	0	a	but the company is not willing to invest more at the moment .
59881	0	a	Yeah .
59882	0	a	Yeah .
59883	0	a	And the price of production
59884	0	a	That is for this basis function and if you want more you pay more .
59885	0	a	Alright
59886	1	a	please go on Norman with the special features .
59887	0	a	Or
59888	0	a	Something like customised .
59889	0	a	Yeah
59890	1	a	we will we will come up to that ,
59891	0	a	the the the thing that makes this the controller cheap is that it is modular so you want more function you pay more .
59892	0	a	If you want less function i i if you want a reasonable price you pay for the functions that you add on to the system , so is modular .
59893	0	a	Yeah yeah ,
59894	0	a	for example the LCD , you can take it you can put it put it back in , or you can use the other one , or the speech recogniser with the microphone
59895	0	a	yeah
59896	0	a	yeah .
59897	0	a	Yeah
59898	0	a	Yeah .
59899	0	a	You want a microphone to put in the speech recogniser you do not wan you pay less for the system you see .
59900	0	a	Okay .
59901	0	a	So
59902	0	a	It is pretty flexible in the yeah price .
59903	0	a	okay .
59904	0	a	You also have the the the two other modules for the parental control that that you ca you can add up to the to your remote control
59905	0	a	i i
59906	0	a	if you if you want to to have more more power on what you do , and which channel you want to choose and so on .
59907	0	a	But
59908	0	a	yeah yeah
59909	1	a	you should present that .
59910	0	a	And this is other one ?
59911	0	a	Yeah .
59912	0	a	H here is just the the the module for the kids and th if the parents want to watch TV , up they come up with their modules , they just plug in it and they can have all the control they want here .
59913	0	a	Yeah .
59914	0	a	We also have this module for old people with big buttons , clearly labelled , and it acts like the previous one , you just plug in and it works .
59915	0	a	Yeah .
59916	0	a	Yeah
59917	0	a	the i the idea
59918	0	a	the the conceptual idea is that simplicity and powerful .
59919	0	a	Simplicity meaning that we have few buttons , powerful is that all the controls with the one you saw we saw earlier in the meetings with lots of buttons n but here you only have few buttons but you retain the the same powerful functionalities .
59920	0	a	But in addition with simplicity .
59921	0	a	So that is the best idea ,
59922	0	a	the cond that
59923	0	a	that is our an innovation
59924	0	a	i in this design here .
59925	0	a	Okay now we come to other important features that I did not tell you .
59926	0	a	The first one is the speech recogniser , again it is detachable or add on .
59927	0	a	And then we also have security feature for example
59928	0	a	this here oop
59929	0	a	it is very robust , it does not break
59930	0	a	and the material , what is the material again ?
59931	0	a	The titanium
59932	0	a	and so it is very
59933	0	a	Well so the price to produce For the simplest one , say we start from four dollars to produce such a device .
59934	0	a	Titanium .
59935	0	a	Again and the battery life is is an is an endurable one , again because this is AA batteries you can choose the types of battery you want .
59936	0	a	Yeah that is fine .
59937	0	a	Lithium ion may be a good one , but you can replace it with cheaper one , again you pay for what you get , and then y the other p points are robust and misplacement reminder .
59938	0	a	So when you finish watching your TV and you the you t you turn off the TV , and then there is this message coming out that please put that back to the charger ,
59939	0	a	so so that is the or is it
59940	0	a	that is the reminder part .
59941	0	a	Okay .
59942	0	a	Yeah
59943	0	a	and
59944	0	a	And it also use a programmable channel and vocabulary , so we did not define the vocabulary so it is up to the user to define
59945	1	a	so sorry ?
59946	0	a	And then because of the chil because children are using the device so we have also a a of TV programmes by genre , and this can be used by the adult or by the children .
59947	0	a	So instead of choosing the channel you are choosing the TV contents of the night .
59948	0	a	So it is pretty powerful ,
59949	0	a	and that is that is why the num buttons are reduced , because of this feature .
59950	0	a	Yeah .
59951	0	a	And and for the materials that is cheap to produce
59952	0	a	I think it is quite clear from yeah .
59953	0	a	And also like the and the fancy designs
59954	0	a	yeah .
59955	1	a	Maybe we can improve more on the design but this is the
59956	0	a	What what is
59957	0	a	Maybe yeah .
59958	0	a	What is the price to p to produce ?
59959	0	a	With with with the charge ?
59960	0	a	Okay .
59961	0	a	it is about it
59962	0	a	The without without the charger it is about well two dollars to produce the microphone and speech recognition systems .
59963	0	a	With the charger ?
59964	1	a	I think we can use Excel .
59965	0	a	Two dollars for the for the add on modules ,
59966	0	a	and finally three dollars for the charger .
59967	0	a	So if you sum up everything wi with the LCD , which costs two dollar , you have two plus four plus four plus two plus two .
59968	0	a	We do not have charger .
59969	0	a	It is about
59970	0	a	so the total cost if you if you want all the fuct functionalities will be about fifteen dollars .
59971	0	a	We do not have all the options .
59972	0	a	Yeah
59973	0	a	Yeah .
59974	0	a	Charger we do not have charger here either .
59975	0	a	Yeah .
59976	0	a	No it is
59977	0	a	it is below the the the budget .
59978	0	a	But it is just if you want all functionalities .
59979	0	a	Yeah .
59980	0	a	Excuse me ?
59981	0	a	Yeah .
59982	0	a	It is below the bu the budget .
59983	0	a	Yeah it is a nice input
59984	0	a	but we have an other inputs from the l public demands .
59985	0	a	We
59986	0	a	Yeah .
59987	1	a	I think we will just have a rough look
59988	1	a	and then we can make our statements , and we can finalise the product based on this discu
59989	1	a	I think we can just go to my presentation then .
59990	0	a	Yeah .
59991	1	a	We can wind up .
59992	1	a	Or we could come to some f final conclusions .
59993	0	a	So the marketing made an evaluation criteria and these were some of the findings , and in the market the people are not really interested with LCD , without LCD , with speech recognition interface , or without speech recognition interface , but most of the people what they are interested is first thing is , they want to have an fancy look and feel , it should be very fancy with colourful and very handy to hold .
59994	0	a	And the second thing is it should be much more technologically innovative .
59995	0	a	Of course in that we could put LCD or recognition to be more technologically innovative .
59996	0	a	And the third one is easy to use .
59997	0	a	Well I think that the technical in innovation is is in the product itself since we have not yet a remote who are allowing to to choose interactively with the TV screen with just four buttons .
59998	1	a	Okay and if we go to the next slide ,
59999	0	a	here you can find these are the latest fashion updates , and so this in Paris and Milan they have detected this trends that the this year it is going to be an year of fruit and vegetable , so people are really interested to see if they have an remote in the shape of the fruit or a vegetable , or whatever they like .
60000	0	a	Spongy spongy .
60001	0	a	So I think it should be much more customised to make a different shapes .
60002	0	a	And the second thing is , and if the material , they really do not want it to be very hard , as in the case of very pl plastic or titanium , it should be somewhat spongy .
60003	0	a	Okay .
60004	0	a	But the the problem is that is it robust to mishandling ?
60005	0	a	We have
60006	1	a	you should find a material that is robust at the same time spongy .
60007	1	a	A sponge .
60008	0	a	Yeah so so finally we have these three criterias .
60009	1	a	Spongy .
60010	0	a	One is fancy look , second is innovative , and third is easy to use .
60011	0	a	So these are the f three criteria on which we are going to build our remote .
60012	0	a	So and we have an evaluation criteria for each one of these , say that we have a seven point scale , from one to seven ,
60013	1	a	and for each of the product you could just give me the scale according to this .
60014	0	a	So now you have with LCD and without LCD , so on this scale , if it is true , if it is if it has a fancy look you could just tell me one , or if it is false , it does not it looks it does not look much fancy
60015	0	a	, then you could just tell me seven .
60016	0	a	So
60017	0	a	We can make our study on this and
60018	0	a	No no
60019	0	a	we have you have designed two products now , one is with LCD and without LCD .
60020	0	a	So
60021	0	a	so is the e evaluation depending on us or other users ?
60022	0	a	Yeah .
60023	0	a	Yeah .
60024	0	a	But who will give the scoring we ourself or or a third party ?
60025	0	a	You .
60026	0	a	According to you ,
60027	0	a	no
60028	0	a	according to you designers ,
60029	0	a	how will feel does it with LCD and without LCD ?
60030	1	a	Okay let us make this L and without LCD .
60031	0	a	On on this scale the LCD remote control .
60032	0	a	How do you look how does it look ?
60033	0	a	D is it very fancy or does not look much fancy ?
60034	0	a	And you both agree for that ?
60035	0	a	So I take three on with LCD ?
60036	0	a	So without LCD how would you rate it ?
60037	0	a	Four .
60038	0	a	Well it does not look much fancy I will I will say three or four .
60039	0	a	And you ?
60040	0	a	I think we can improve on the design .
60041	0	a	Yeah .
60042	0	a	Som someone commented this is like a the stone age design .
60043	0	a	It is it it
60044	0	a	Technical aspects .
60045	0	a	we have been focused all all this time on the on the technical aspect , functional aspect , but also the simplicity .
60046	1	a	As for the design maybe we c should hire a designer to help .
60047	0	a	Yeah a three .
60048	0	a	Yeah .
60049	0	a	four .
60050	0	a	I think it is it is more easy to make f fancy things when it is not complicated so removing the LCD
60051	0	a	gives us a li more liberty to to have a fancy look .
60052	0	a	Yeah .
60053	0	a	Yeah .
60054	0	a	And in the sense of innovativeness , with LCD .
60055	0	a	Well it is it is the same for both
60056	0	a	so I will give a five , six .
60057	0	a	Five with LCD and So without LCD ?
60058	0	a	No no
60059	0	a	according to design aspect we want to know how would you feel the innovativeness ?
60060	0	a	With LCD .
60061	0	a	Well five also
60062	0	a	Norman please .
60063	0	a	Yeah
60064	0	a	from the innovation aspect I feel that what is most innovative of our prototype compared to the existing prototypes that we saw l in the last meeting is that the retrieval of TV programmes by content ,
60065	0	a	because that is really innovative ,
60066	0	a	and for now and another innovation we have is simplicity and simplicity , few buttons , we have A lot of functionalities .
60067	0	a	For LCD .
60068	0	a	With lot of functionalities .
60069	0	a	So that is that is for both th
60070	0	a	Our gi
60071	0	a	I think that the our our product is has the best in all
60072	0	a	well this is a biased judgement because we designed them .
60073	0	a	Yeah .
60074	0	a	the innovation is v is very high I think .
60075	0	a	And without LCD ?
60076	0	a	Okay .
60077	0	a	Both .
60078	0	a	for both it is the the same innovations .
60079	0	a	For both .
60080	0	a	It is the same innovation .
60081	0	a	So maybe I can put six to seven .
60082	0	a	six , let is go for six .
60083	0	a	Without LCD .
60084	0	a	Both .
60085	0	a	No
60086	0	a	actually to make it with LCD you make more efforts .
60087	0	a	So I there is high innovativeness included if you make it with LCD
60088	0	a	y then when it is without LCD there is not much innovativeness .
60089	0	a	Yeah .
60090	0	a	no innovative yeah .
60091	0	a	So we ca not go
60092	0	a	I mean that what you are sayin that is what the design
60093	0	a	No it is like this ,
60094	0	a	I mean on the LCD , according to what I understand from your model is , you have a joystick here , and you have LCD
60095	0	a	, you just press your joystick , you get here a programme .
60096	0	a	there w there was a there was a issue here is that what are what is the display on the LCD ?
60097	0	a	We have not really determined what are actually actually
60098	0	a	it is good to have a LCD
60099	0	a	but what are we going to display on a LCD ?
60100	0	a	Yeah ?
60101	0	a	Yeah .
60102	1	a	Talk about
60103	0	a	Yeah
60104	0	a	but you have the same programme on the TV screen .
60105	1	a	So let is remove it .
60106	0	a	Yeah
60107	0	a	but
60108	0	a	Yes exactly .
60109	0	a	then
60110	0	a	No
60111	0	a	on the TV you do not it does not display on the TV now .
60112	0	a	But
60113	0	a	This is the problem .
60114	0	a	If you have the LCD ,
60115	0	a	but if n
60116	0	a	Yeah .
60117	0	a	LCD ?
60118	0	a	Then there is no meaning in having it on the TV .
60119	0	a	Or then again you have a channels , volume and all the stuff and what a
60120	0	a	I mean that depends upon your design , so
60121	0	a	I mean
60122	0	a	So without LCD you want to put it fi the same level of innovativeness ?
60123	0	a	And which do you recommend e easy to use , with LCD or without LCD ?
60124	0	a	Yeah .
60125	0	a	But you cannot display all on a LCD .
60126	0	a	Anyway for for the users who who who opt for LCD we will give them the give them the LCD , we give what the customer wants , right .
60127	0	a	Yeah .
60128	0	a	Well I think both are really easy to use
60129	0	a	because there are few button buttons , and well t p the menu are clear , well organised , so Well with little knowing of the technology you can you can easily use the product
60130	0	a	so I will give a six for the easy to use .
60131	0	a	Yeah
60132	0	a	Yeah .
60133	0	a	Yeah .
60134	0	a	Yeah
60135	0	a	I think
60136	0	a	sorry .
60137	0	a	No it is just if I I see the the f the rate
60138	0	a	I think it is better to do it without LCD .
60139	0	a	Because that is with LCD just will increase the price , and I thi i
60140	0	a	they have the same rate so without LCD
60141	0	a	it will be
60142	0	a	Yeah .
60143	1	a	Or we can just go back to the previous slide where we ha we have a few updates .
60144	1	a	So I mean in the product design you could just amend it to make some few changes
60145	0	a	according to fruit and vegetable or a spongy touch without LCD and without speech recognition .
60146	0	a	Yeah .
60147	0	a	Yeah .
60148	0	a	Yeah .
60149	0	a	Even then our product is going to be very good .
60150	0	a	Yeah ,
60151	0	a	it is cheaper to produce .
60152	0	a	Yeah .
60153	0	a	S
60154	0	a	Yeah .
60155	0	a	And if the the
60156	0	a	well if we have less technology we have more liberty to for the shape and things like that so
60157	0	a	Yep .
60158	0	a	Yeah that is right .
60159	1	a	I have another thing to say about the easy to use aspect .
60160	0	a	I think the easy to use aspect is different for different people .
60161	0	a	For the young generation easy to use may be very complicated because they w they wants lot of controls with lots of buttons .
60162	0	a	For kids they want simply the s similarit for the old people they want simplicity , so that is why we have the parental module .
60163	0	a	Yeah
60164	0	a	yeah
60165	0	a	that is right .
60166	0	a	we can ha have build a more complex design if if they want it , but but what I am trying to say here is that the we have different sets of buttons for different kinds of people .
60167	0	a	So in terms of easy to use
60168	0	a	I think it is very user customisable .
60169	0	a	User customisation is very important
60170	0	a	yeah .
60171	0	a	Yeah .
60172	0	a	Yeah
60173	0	a	so
60174	0	a	W
60175	0	a	I think it is the same .
60176	1	a	So without LCD I just take it five ?
60177	0	a	Or you want it to be six ?
60178	0	a	S s
60179	0	a	oh I think it is better to have this without LCD .
60180	0	a	Six .
60181	0	a	six .
60182	0	a	Yeah .
60183	0	a	Yes as you say , with better
60184	0	a	yeah .
60185	0	a	Without LCD .
60186	1	a	And to improve the the look .
60187	0	a	As our Programme Manager s Pro Project Manager says that without LCD it is going to reduce the cost also , and it is going to be much simpler to use .
60188	0	a	Yeah .
60189	0	a	Yeah .
60190	0	a	Yes and to give us more liberty to have a fancy look
60191	0	a	so
60192	1	a	so let is go back to our laboratory and
60193	0	a	Yeah .
60194	0	a	Yeah .
60195	0	a	So .
60196	0	a	What a what what about the sys speech recognition ?
60197	0	a	what about the integration of speech recognition ?
60198	0	a	so it is optional with the okay .
60199	0	a	To improve on the design .
60200	0	a	Huh ?
60201	0	a	The speech recogniser is a add on module .
60202	0	a	Right ?
60203	0	a	Yeah .
60204	0	a	That is going to be an optional .
60205	0	a	If somebody wants to buy it they can have it , otherwise no .
60206	0	a	It is an optional .
60207	0	a	It is optional yeah , since well according to this study people more likes more to have a spongy remote control than
60208	0	a	Yeah .
60209	0	a	I think it will be
60210	0	a	I think
60211	0	a	i
60212	1	a	I think it will be better if we have all these modules in the same remote control ,
60213	0	a	because maybe parents will lose these
60214	0	a	Yeah .
60215	0	a	Yeah .
60216	0	a	Yeah ,
60217	0	a	but I mean if you have an add ons , the kids may just hide the parental module and so that their parents ca not use it .
60218	0	a	Or ma
60219	0	a	yeah .
60220	0	a	Or maybe parents they can for forget where they put it or ,
60221	1	a	so mayb better if you have all this in the same
60222	0	a	Yeah .
60223	0	a	In the same set , yeah ,
60224	1	a	and and individual buttons to make them work .
60225	0	a	The problem is if i we are bla if a customer wants a certain component , and does not want the parental control because it is a couple who do not have children when you sell the product in the market you could meet any kind of people , and not all people will need all the functionalities we propose to them .
60226	0	a	So we might lose the customer because of this .
60227	0	a	I do not know ,
60228	0	a	what do you think ?
60229	0	a	Yes exa
60230	0	a	what do you think ,
60231	0	a	I do not know .
60232	0	a	So you mean that even if these modules will be will be functional will be optional .
60233	0	a	You are Marketing Manag .
60234	1	a	I mean how to how to how to make a marketing survey that how many married couple or how many couples have a TV or to the number or singles who have a television .
60235	0	a	I think it inc increase .
60236	0	a	Yeah .
60237	0	a	So based on that I think
60238	1	a	But you can make it on a single PC with three different options .
60239	0	a	Yeah .
60240	0	a	But the the question is n does those modularity increase the production cost or decrease the production cost ?
60241	0	a	Well you can if you had something li
60242	0	a	Oh no ,
60243	0	a	because if you if you add something
60244	0	a	well yeah maybe
60245	0	a	because it is three different pieces to to to build but
60246	0	a	Yeah
60247	0	a	yeah
60248	0	a	yeah
60249	0	a	it is
60250	0	a	I think it is cheaper if you if you already built the all the functionalities on the same module ,
60251	0	a	but Yeah .
60252	0	a	I think it i increases .
60253	0	a	Yeah .
60254	0	a	On the same PCB
60255	0	a	yeah yeah .
60256	0	a	Well well the other aspect is that if in the when they have the ar existing product you you going to maintain the the you are going to keep the same customer , because the same customer will come back to buy other add ons .
60257	0	a	Yeah that is right .
60258	0	a	So so
60259	0	a	Yeah
60260	0	a	i
60261	0	a	i so if do not do not buy now they can buy i in the future .
60262	0	a	I mean you could just provide with an optional .
60263	0	a	So in in that way you are actually keeping the cus the same customer , attracting them to come back in again and again .
60264	0	a	So it is something like a Microsoft product update .
60265	0	a	We are not trying to follow the Microsoft
60266	0	a	and we do not want to the m
60267	0	a	Yeah well if the buyers can be up the th would be can be upgraded , it would be a good thing right ?
60268	0	a	Yeah , it depends on the v production .
60269	0	a	And and we we we
60270	0	a	we we
60271	0	a	we do not want that .
60272	0	a	Updates and we sell it .
60273	0	a	We make updates and sell it .
60274	0	a	Yeah .
60275	0	a	And what is the idea about the shape of the remote controls ?
60276	0	a	can they be made into a fruit and vegetable types ?
60277	0	a	Do you require different types of PCBs and
60278	1	a	Or it could be like this the PCB would be the same for all , but only the exterior shape is different o for all .
60279	0	a	Well so
60280	0	a	Yeah yeah
60281	0	a	I think we are
60282	0	a	yeah
60283	0	a	but we are also the well the components will have to change because we have to deal with the shape
60284	0	a	and but I do not think it will increase the cost too much
60285	0	a	so well
60286	0	a	but it is a bit complicated to if if if you need machines to different machines to well
60287	0	a	Yeah yeah
60288	1	a	we can have the same global shape and then add on skins and with with this tex spongy texture things like that .
60289	0	a	Yeah .
60290	1	a	What we can change is to propose the customers with skins .
60291	0	a	For example the i the mobile phones nowaday , they sell different kinds of skin and then people just feel that oh I have a new skin and looks better .
60292	0	a	Yeah , yeah
60293	0	a	that is right .
60294	0	a	Yeah .
60295	0	a	Yeah .
60296	0	a	Yeah that is right .
60297	0	a	Yeah .
60298	0	a	Yeah you can pl
60299	0	a	in what material would that be in ?
60300	1	a	Yeah or furry like a pet dog kind of thing .
60301	0	a	Sponge .
60302	1	a	I think you need to look into the material .
60303	0	a	Yeah yeah .
60304	0	a	Okay .
60305	0	a	So
60306	0	a	Project evaluation project satisfaction , for example .
60307	1	a	So we finished the prototype presentation if you have something else to say .
60308	1	a	I think the Project Manager would be interested to look about the financial issues in making these models .
60309	0	a	I do not know , we have to ask these question .
60310	0	a	We have to give answers so Project evaluation .
60311	0	a	I suppose that you this criteria , is it ?
60312	0	a	Room for creativity .
60313	0	a	This room is a bit small , but but I think it is okay for us to work with .
60314	0	a	I feel it is fine , we know we do not need
60315	0	a	I think it is okay .
60316	0	a	Yeah .
60317	0	a	That was good .
60318	0	a	This is fine for making a presentat for project presentations .
60319	0	a	Yeah anyway we have the laboratory nearby to build our modules so it is okay .
60320	0	a	Yeah .
60321	0	a	And the leadership was excellent .
60322	0	a	Yeah I think so .
60323	0	a	Good job good job .
60324	0	a	He gave you the liberty to talk as you wants .
60325	0	a	Yeah that is right .
60326	0	a	Yeah that is right .
60327	0	a	the teamwork was very very good .
60328	0	a	Fine
60329	0	a	yes Very democratic .
60330	0	a	I was really I am very satisfying to work with with you .
60331	0	a	Thank you .
60332	0	a	Thank you .
60333	0	a	Oh .
60334	0	a	Alright .
60335	0	a	Alright .
60336	0	a	And new ideas found .
60337	0	a	Any new ideas to make these presentations more interactive and more interesting ?
60338	0	a	I mean what type of product would you think could we make this more interesting ?
60339	0	a	Yeah
60340	0	a	that is within the budget .
60341	1	a	Come up with new product .
60342	0	a	Less fancy .
60343	1	a	we I I know something , we need more cakes , more biscuits on the table while we have meetings .
60344	1	a	Yeah and also more well more seriously I think it is it is a good idea to have clear clear points whenever we do a meeting prior to the meeting to have well a list with the points who will be discussed or things like that ,
60345	0	a	but I think it is alright .
60346	0	a	We achieved project goal I think .
60347	0	a	De
60348	0	a	Without without LCD , without speech recognition , it will be simple .
60349	0	a	It is w
60350	0	a	yes , more or less .
60351	0	a	And the evaluation was
60352	0	a	Yeah that is right .
60353	0	a	Yeah
60354	0	a	but
60355	0	a	Alright .
60356	0	a	And the next is celebration .

60368	1	a	So I want to introduce first of all the names and the colleagues here .
60369	1	a	And what you are drawing ?
60370	0	a	how you spell your name ?

60374	0	a	My name is Ed and I do accounting .
60375	0	a	ED .
60376	1	a	And ?
60377	0	a	So only accounting ?
60378	0	a	Okay .
60379	0	a	Do you also do marketing ?
60380	0	a	And I am Christine , and my role in this scenario is to be the industrial designer .
60381	0	a	No .
60382	0	a	Accounting , yes .
60383	1	a	And ?
60384	0	a	Industrial designer .
60385	0	a	But I am not really one .
60386	0	a	So who is marketing , nobody in the market
60387	0	a	It is you , okay .
60388	0	a	Marketing is , is me .
60389	0	a	So thanks for coming for the meeting first of all ,
60390	0	a	and we have a long time , just twenty five minutes to discuss about this project and the the project initiation .
60391	1	a	First of all I want to ask Mister Ed about your marketing plan and your product plan and
60392	0	a	but do you already have like a functional design or a technical design or
60393	0	a	Oh for the moment not yet , okay ,
60394	0	a	but what is what is your
60395	0	a	do you have some project plan , something with you or
60396	0	a	Well I think that we will see that throughout the day in how we are going to put this together as a marketing to to market the product .
60397	1	a	We will have to see on a through discussion on where we are going to go from here and from with this .
60398	0	a	for the moment not yet .
60399	0	a	Good question .
60400	0	a	No , this is like I said that we have to be discussed between all of us and we will go from there .
60401	0	a	We will have to simply we will have to work on it together .
60402	0	a	Okay ,
60403	0	a	so by when you think you can give me some kind of project plan , okay ,
60404	0	a	a discussion with
60405	0	a	By next meeting , okay that will be great .
60406	0	a	Certainly by the next meeting .
60407	0	a	Okay ,
60408	0	a	so there is any questions or first of all about this project ?
60409	1	a	the goal of the project I think maybe I will hand out to the Ed , okay , so to explain what is the project because he is in the sales and the accounting .
60410	0	a	What is the goal of the project ?
60411	0	a	no , I I have not begun working on the design ,
60412	0	a	and I
60413	0	a	I actually did not know we were designing a remote control , I thought we were designing a new monitor .
60414	0	a	I am in the sales I am supposed to explain them what to do .
60415	0	a	We have to define exactly what our product is , from From what I had in mind we are supposed to be marketing coffee ,
60416	0	a	is that right ?
60417	0	a	Remote controls ,
60418	0	a	cause I had two different things .
60419	0	a	Yes ,
60420	1	a	so can you explain what exactly the product is ?
60421	0	a	Oh I think , if I am not wrong , we are making the remote control .
60422	0	a	I was wondering
60423	0	a	I had a first part of mine was to make a remote control for a new f remote control for television , and afterward I had a discussion about coffee so
60424	1	a	we will start with the remote control for television then .
60425	0	a	Yes .
60426	0	a	So we are have to design something that is very user friendly .
60427	0	a	Something visual that has something that will will draw people to buy the product , because I think everybody is experienced with remote controls , and some remote controls are are worth throwing out the window .
60428	0	a	th most of them ar
60429	0	a	I do not know
60430	0	a	we are have to come up with a new idea on how to make it a lot easier to use , cause a lot of times spend half a day through the instruction book trying to figure out how to use it .
60431	0	a	And what abo
60432	1	a	Christine , what about your the industrial design plan ?
60433	0	a	Are you have a design already on this product or you are still working on the design ?
60434	0	a	the website I went to look at had some announcements about an introduction of a some sort of a seven inch monitor , and I understood that that was the project goal .
60435	0	a	So I am glad I did not d do any work ahead of time because I clearly did not understand the project goal .
60436	0	a	Okay .
60437	0	a	I just did s see that we were starting a new project together and there was going to be a four member team composed of these people , and that is about that is
60438	0	a	and I I read through the different steps , and what my responsibilities were relative to the steps .
60439	0	a	So you will be leading the team for your design team or how many members is working in the team , for the design ?
60440	0	a	Yes .
60441	0	a	for the industrial design ?
60442	0	a	well , I would th think that depends on how much money you give us .
60443	0	a	Okay .
60444	0	a	That is
60445	1	a	Yeah , but before we talk about the finance , okay , do you have some idea how we can sell this product or project in the market and how much is going to benefit to the company and of course it is to the individual also .
60446	0	a	because , you know , you can you can make it you have different choices with different financial models .
60447	0	a	Well , you know ,
60448	1	a	I kind of think that in general you have to do y
60449	1	a	you have to have something that is very fashionable
60450	1	a	, that is very attractive that people see and recognize its goal , and they immediately want to have it have one of their own .
60451	0	a	So it would really would need to
60452	1	a	something like the iPod would be good , seems to have caught on fairly well ,
60453	0	a	so d
60454	0	a	you know , I do not care what it does , just so it looks cool .
60455	0	a	Okay ,
60456	0	a	but when you think you can give me like a kind of design on the functional design or the technical design ?
60457	0	a	Yeah ,
60458	0	a	but I need something in the writing ,
60459	1	a	so like what is your functional design
60460	1	a	, what is your technical design , and how many people you need for this project , and what is the time frame you are looking , okay , and what is the budget , maybe initial budget you are looking , okay , and how is going to the market , okay ,
60461	1	a	so you have you have had to meet with the marketing team and how they are going to market and what are the marketing strategic plan
60462	1	a	, okay , when are you going to introduce , okay , and by the time you introduce the product and you know there there would be a competition ,
60463	0	a	okay , so I need some kind of the plan in the writing from you .
60464	0	a	Well , I have got a lot of other projects I am doing right now
60465	0	a	and so I will have to wait and see how those how those go .
60466	0	a	If they go quickly then it could be a month .
60467	0	a	If if I run into any problems in my other projects it might be six months .
60468	0	a	Okay , and it is po
60469	0	a	B as soon as possible .
60470	0	a	And when would you like that ?
60471	0	a	well if if we have enough time then d do you think two weeks is a is close enough ?
60472	0	a	are there other people who will be contributing to the plan ?
60473	0	a	Okay , I will get back to you on that .
60474	0	a	Yes I think that would be good ,
60475	0	a	because I need to go to the management and tell them what we are going to do , and what cost is , okay , and what is the time frame and what is the project plan , because without any documentations , I cannot go to the management and say , so we are going to do this
60476	0	a	and we need this much money ,
60477	0	a	okay , so then it is it is difficult for me to say ,
60478	0	a	okay , that is the reason I need some kind of plan from you , initially , okay , then we can have the further discussion again .
60479	0	a	Yes , of course ,
60480	1	a	if you need some help , so let me know .
60481	1	a	So , who are the people you need from the marketing or the technical side or the administration point of view , okay , to add in any documentation , or some technical point of view , so just let me know so I can coordinate all the teams .
60482	0	a	Yes .
60483	0	a	Thank you .
60484	0	a	Okay .
60485	0	a	And Ed so what is what do you think about this project for the remote control
60486	0	a	and d do you have some already planned something for your marketing strategy or the sales strategy ?
60487	0	a	Well not yet other than doing research and taking remote controls and looking what other companies have to do , what they are building , their designs , their ideas , also have to pinpoint which market we are going to go into .
60488	0	a	It should be a fairly large market because the number of people that the competition ,
60489	0	a	th I agree it has to be something it has to be something new ,
60490	0	a	it has to be something that that draws people saying eh , I like this .
60491	0	a	Whether it works or not , they have to first say I like this , I like the design , and then it is gotta be simple to use .
60492	1	a	Yes , so what I prefer maybe you need to interact more with the Christine , okay ,
60493	0	a	because you know what she is going to do it ,
60494	0	a	okay ,
60495	0	a	and you know how to sell it .
60496	0	a	Okay , because she is doing the design , but you are the core because you are in the marketing , okay , so because you need to sell and you are the responsible for the all the money , the finance , okay , tomorrow .
60497	0	a	Yeah .
60498	1	a	So , what I prefer , okay , so you need to interact with the Christine more and within her team , okay , who is using the functional design or technical design , okay , and you need to come up with some kind of plan , okay , how we are going to do the your sales plan , okay ,
60499	0	a	th Th
60500	0	a	That that is
60501	0	a	Yes , that is you have to decide , okay ,
60502	1	a	so the best thing is you both of the Christine and you discuss with yourself , okay , and come up with the cost , and how we are going to compete in the market , okay , in the the technically , or in the sales wise , okay , the commercial wise , okay .
60503	0	a	Do we already have a cost limit on this , th an idea of how much we want to market this for , how much it is going to sell for
60504	0	a	, that is up that is up to us to decide , eh ?
60505	0	a	Very good .
60506	0	a	Then we have to design , okay , how long it will take the whole project , okay , how much is going to cost us , and how much we are going to benefit for the company .
60507	0	a	Okay , of course it is it is of benefit for everybody individually .
60508	1	a	Okay , so I think it is maybe if we can give me some kind of your the sales plan , okay , including the technical what she is going to talk to you within the team , okay , then it will help me to discuss with the management for further , okay , and put it in the the proper project plan .
60509	0	a	Okay , and if you need any coordination in between compared to the maybe the some technical vendors or commercial vendors , okay , depends if you want to have some marketing plan or technical plan , okay , so you let me know .
60510	0	a	Okay , I can coordinate ,
60511	0	a	or maybe , you are my coordinator , am I right ?
60512	0	a	Between all the coor
60513	0	a	Yeah .
60514	0	a	Very good .
60515	0	a	Well , no , not exactly .
60516	0	a	I mean my job from what I understood was to look at the usability requirements and make sure that the product is usable , it is acceptable to the people who are going to use it and look at the best ways to do that .
60517	1	a	So I think I will have to interact with Christine and discuss with her , so that she is not designing something that my studies will show right off the bat that it is not going to work ,
60518	0	a	and so it is sort of it is a loop that feeds in , but I do not think necessarily that I am in a coordinating position for it .
60519	0	a	Th Christine , yeah .
60520	0	a	Which is
60521	0	a	Yes .
60522	0	a	Yeah , so basically you need to interact with Christine more , okay , for the user acceptability , okay , and the testing , okay ,
60523	0	a	then you will
60524	0	a	Yes .
60525	0	a	Yeah .
60526	0	a	Which will also feed into the marketing , because depending on what users want , depends on how you sell it , what tag lines you attach to it , how you try to make it more attractive to users .
60527	0	a	Yes .
60528	0	a	Yeah .
60529	0	a	Yeah .
60530	0	a	Yeah .
60531	0	a	So I think all three groups will need to interact quite a bit .
60532	0	a	, and then
60533	1	a	I guess build the plan based on all of that ,
60534	0	a	because I think you need to take all the factors into account .
60535	0	a	Yep .
60536	0	a	But what I request , okay , keep Ed in the loop , okay , in between your meeting and Christine meeting , because he should know what is happening .
60537	0	a	Yeah , of course .
60538	1	a	Yeah , we can CC him on any discussions or documents that are passed around .
60539	0	a	Yes .
60540	1	a	Okay and please please copy all the mails , okay , all the discussions to me , okay ,
60541	0	a	so I need to submit to the management .
60542	0	a	Sure .
60543	0	a	No problem .
60544	0	a	So any questions for time being ?
60545	0	a	Yes .
60546	0	a	So , the immediate next step is to start determining the functional design , or
60547	0	a	okay .
60548	0	a	Okay .
60549	0	a	To come up with the functional design and to discuss with Ed , okay , and how it is going to be work , and first of all with your user acceptance , okay , how it looks like and how it is going to be work in the market ,
60550	0	a	okay , so then we can discuss about further things .
60551	0	a	Okay .
60552	0	a	So , we will meet when the we will discuss on the further meeting .
60553	0	a	It is okay ?
60554	0	a	Thanks for coming .
60555	1	a	Would you mind at the conclusion of our meeting could could you send us a copy of your slides ?
60556	1	a	Yes , I will .
60557	0	a	yeah , that would be useful .
60558	1	a	Yes .

60560	1	a	le let us keep all the emails and all the copies , okay , share each other ,
60561	1	a	okay

60580	0	a	I hope you have a fresh head and a fresh time .
60581	0	a	How t now the meeting
60582	0	a	actually we gathering here to discuss about the functional design meeting .
60583	0	a	Okay ,
60584	0	a	and we will issue some information from all of you .
60585	0	a	And it is in the , I think , in the sharing folder .
60586	1	a	And I will invite the Christine and the Ed and Agnes to discuss about on the various subjects .
60587	0	a	So
60588	1	a	can you go to the next slide ?
60589	0	a	Yeah
60590	0	a	the agenda of the meeting is opening .
60591	0	a	Then I am going to talk about the project management , what I am going to do , and , of course , I am doing the project management and secretary both ,
60592	0	a	okay ,
60593	0	a	to take the minutes of the meeting .
60594	0	a	And there are three presentations .
60595	0	a	One is new project requirements .
60596	0	a	And the second one about decision on remote control functions .
60597	0	a	And finally we are closing .
60598	0	a	and the meeting time will be forty minutes ,
60599	1	a	so you have to be very quick .
60600	0	a	And I have come up with the
60601	0	a	management come with the new proposal ,
60602	0	a	okay ,
60603	1	a	and I have to discuss a few points on this .
60604	0	a	both says new insights in the aim of your project .
60605	0	a	the one is the teletext becomes outmoded ,
60606	0	a	okay
60607	0	a	because if because of the computer systems and the new technology .
60608	0	a	So
60609	0	a	we do not need to consider really about the teletext all in our new project design .
60610	0	a	And the second one is about the remote control .
60611	0	a	Should be used only for the TV .
60612	0	a	That is what our management says .
60613	0	a	And the third point , it is very very important to establish our marketing or corporate image , okay , with this new project or new product .
60614	0	a	Okay .
60615	0	a	So
60616	0	a	I will invite
60617	1	a	Agnes , can you go to the third slide ?
60618	0	a	Okay , .
60619	0	a	No ,
60620	0	a	this is the third slide .
60621	0	a	So ,
60622	1	a	I will invite Christine to discuss about the functional design .
60623	0	a	Kay ,
60624	1	a	do you want to open the
60625	0	a	I am number two .
60626	0	a	Sure .
60627	0	a	You are participant
60628	0	a	s
60629	0	a	Two ?
60630	0	a	Do you want the mouse , or do you want me to
60631	0	a	That is it .
60632	1	a	I will do the notes .
60633	0	a	Yeah ,
60634	0	a	thanks .
60635	0	a	So well
60636	1	a	I I figured we should identify some user requirements , and from my experience , I want to , and from research I did , the the device has to turn the television on and off the first time you press on the big button ,
60637	0	a	you ca not ca not have like waffling on this point , you know .
60638	0	a	Really have It needs to be able
60639	1	a	y y have to be able to find it .
60640	0	a	Because one of the biggest problems with remote controls is finding them .
60641	0	a	So ,
60642	1	a	I also ,
60643	0	a	since we have to establish our corporate image on the basis of this new product ,
60644	1	a	thought we better look at things that are popular and ex go beyond those ,
60645	0	a	and , as I said in the first meeting ,
60646	1	a	and then we might want to talk eventually about the materials that are appropriate to use in in the construction , especially in the the the outside of the product
60647	0	a	so that it gives the appearance , and it is reliable , and so forth .
60648	0	a	I did a little history on the the remote controls and when they were invented and so forth ,
60649	0	a	so ,
60650	0	a	I guess this guy Zenith created the Flashmatic ,
60651	0	a	which I kind of like the idea ,
60652	0	a	cause it made me think of maybe the remote control made a big flash when you turn the TV on and off ,
60653	0	a	that might be interesting .
60654	0	a	And so
60655	0	a	it was highly directional flash light that you could turn the picture on and off , and the sound on and off , and change channels
60656	0	a	c
60657	0	a	so I think those are still requirements we have today , fifty years later .
60658	0	a	And it was really a pioneering innovation , but it was sensitive to the sun ,
60659	0	a	so that it would get would start off by the you would get
60660	0	a	it would easily cause problems .
60661	0	a	So ,
60662	0	a	I in addition to looking at the the functional requir
60663	0	a	so
60664	0	a	all these devices are examples of where they represent examples that are available today
60665	0	a	which I think the one in the middle is r really something to keep in mind .
60666	0	a	Fantastic .
60667	0	a	It would be easy to find .
60668	0	a	And it would y
60669	0	a	you would
60670	0	a	you could throw it at things if if the TV did not turn on and off , you could use it for something else .
60671	0	a	And since I am not really Industrial Designer , I did not really know what to do with this slide .
60672	0	a	But I just took some different schematics and I put them into this , and I guess this is what a slide might look like if you were drawing a circuit board .
60673	0	a	I do not know why we were asked to do this .
60674	0	a	So ,
60675	0	a	personal preferences ,
60676	0	a	I think we could
60677	0	a	I I am really thinking outside the box here ,
60678	1	a	and I think that we should consider perhaps having an an an a a size a remote control that changes in size depending on the user preference .
60679	1	a	So something that is very very flexible and inflatable and then you could shrink it .
60680	1	a	I think it could either be you could go either one extreme , be very colourful , or you could make it clear , and kind of blend in with things ,
60681	0	a	so you did not have to have a problem with the th the decoration of the of the user is home .
60682	1	a	I think it needs to be waterproof ,
60683	0	a	because sometimes they fall into cups
60684	0	a	and , you know ,
60685	0	a	it might be out by the swimming pool or something like that .
60686	0	a	if you mi one of
60687	0	a	one of my requirements was about needs t to tell you when it is done its job or not , because half the time , I keep pushing on the remote control , and I do not know if it is actually understood my message ,
60688	1	a	so I think it should give you some sort of an oral cue .
60689	1	a	And , course I never want to replace the battery .
60690	0	a	So ,
60691	0	a	that is
60692	0	a	those are my f preferences , and that is my presentation .
60693	0	a	Yeah ,
60694	1	a	let me interrupt you
60695	1	a	if you can add other facility , other feature , like unbreakable .
60696	0	a	Yes .
60697	0	a	Okay ,
60698	0	a	because especially today , you know , you have the family and the kids ,
60699	0	a	okay ,
60700	0	a	and the kids throw it and
60701	0	a	they they play with their remotes
60702	0	a	and .
60703	0	a	Run over it with a car .
60704	0	a	Yes .
60705	0	a	Okay , so
60706	1	a	if you can add the feature , okay , for your fabric whatever in your outline design okay , with unbreakable ,
60707	0	a	okay ,
60708	0	a	I think that will give a lot of advantage for our product ,
60709	1	a	if I am not wrong .
60710	0	a	Good idea .
60711	0	a	Good idea ,
60712	0	a	I will I will
60713	0	a	Yes , very good .
60714	1	a	Maybe you can add it in that .
60715	0	a	Okay ,
60716	0	a	thank you Christine ,
60717	0	a	and any questions or clarifications , or any discussion on the functional design ?
60718	0	a	Yes .
60719	1	a	Do you have any preconceived ideas in terms of materials ?
60720	0	a	Cause , for example , in the unbreakable thing , doing something plastic would be harder , whereas having something like , I dunno , steel or titanium is not really economically viable .
60721	0	a	Titanium .
60722	0	a	Titanium would be be heavy , too ,
60723	0	a	would not it ?
60724	1	a	No , I have not really
60725	0	a	I wanted feedback ,
60726	1	a	I think we need to rate rank these ,
60727	0	a	but we will see what your personal preferences are and your thoughts .
60728	0	a	Titanium .
60729	0	a	Yeah .
60730	0	a	Yeah .
60731	0	a	Sure , yeah .
60732	0	a	No ,
60733	0	a	I just wondering whether that you had any sort of
60734	0	a	Yeah .
60735	0	a	I like titanium .
60736	0	a	It is light .
60737	0	a	Expensive .
60738	0	a	yeah
60739	0	a	but who who said who said we were ,
60740	0	a	you know ,
60741	0	a	nobody told me how mu what our financial objective is , so
60742	0	a	It would be hard to inflate something ou made out of titanium though .
60743	0	a	The marketing comes out .
60744	0	a	Yeah
60745	0	a	so
60746	0	a	Yeah
60747	0	a	the the
60748	0	a	I am sorry
60749	0	a	because the last meeting we supposed to discuss about the financial thing .
60750	1	a	let me go quickly , maybe if I can go back .
60751	0	a	I know the project plan and the budget .
60752	0	a	So I can close this , not sure .
60753	0	a	Was in S
60754	0	a	This .
60755	0	a	So let me see where is this file .
60756	0	a	That is Christine is .
60757	0	a	This is Christine .
60758	0	a	And that is mine , I think .
60759	0	a	That is yours , okay .
60760	0	a	Saving .
60761	0	a	In modified .
60762	0	a	I do not know ,
60763	0	a	I think verbally we can we can pretty much sell .
60764	0	a	Okay ,
60765	1	a	I will I will send you a mail ,
60766	0	a	okay ?
60767	0	a	The project may be the the project aim ,
60768	0	a	okay .
60769	0	a	At the end of the day , the company wants to make at least the fifty million Euro .
60770	0	a	Okay ,
60771	1	a	and of course the price will be very reasonable on the the sales side .
60772	0	a	Okay ,
60773	0	a	that maybe Eddie will talk to you about how much the price
60774	0	a	and what is
60775	0	a	how much its cost for the manufacturing and how much it is going to be we sell in the market .
60776	0	a	Okay .
60777	1	a	Then you can come back with your feedback .
60778	0	a	And I I have one maybe the suggestion or opinion .
60779	1	a	This remote control , okay , it can be for like universal , to use for any TV .
60780	0	a	Okay ,
60781	1	a	and it will be slim ,
60782	0	a	okay ,
60783	0	a	and
60784	0	a	Not fat .
60785	0	a	Not fat ?
60786	0	a	Not fat , huh .
60787	0	a	Okay .
60788	0	a	Might be hard to find , though .
60789	0	a	Yep .
60790	1	a	But let is try it , okay , with the different the designs , okay , the functional designs .
60791	0	a	Oh , okay .
60792	0	a	Okay ?
60793	0	a	So
60794	0	a	any other questions ?
60795	0	a	Okay .
60796	0	a	from her side , I do not think there is too many more questions .
60797	0	a	If you can come to the
60798	0	a	Okay ,
60799	0	a	from the marketing
60800	0	a	yeah , from the marketing side , just to to give an idea what the management is looking for
60801	0	a	, I was looking for a a remote control to have a s
60802	0	a	I have a sales price of twenty five Euro , with a production price of twelve and a half Euro .
60803	0	a	Thank you Christine for time being ,
60804	1	a	so then Ed , so can you tell about
60805	0	a	S iscuse me for one sec .
60806	0	a	For what I think from what we are trying to find , we are tr we are looking for , I do not think that price is exactly in the market .
60807	0	a	Okay ?
60808	1	a	I will explain myself here now
60809	0	a	in the sense that in a
60810	0	a	in the recent surveys , from the ages fr from fifteen to thirty five , eighty percent are willing to spend more money for something as fancy as trendy .
60811	0	a	Twenty five Euros , that is that is a preson reasonable price .
60812	0	a	That is a market price right now .
60813	1	a	Now if we are going to take a risk , and push this up a bit , make it more expensive , but give them added things that they do not have now ,
60814	0	a	then it w it could possibly sell .
60815	0	a	Yep .
60816	0	a	Yep .
60817	0	a	Obviously the risk is there .
60818	0	a	Too expensive , they are not going to buy .
60819	0	a	But , I think there is one other thing interesting two things that are interesting
60820	0	a	is that from the fifteen to thirty five year old group , which always spends more money on trendy new things , speech recognition is requested .
60821	0	a	And we are talking between seventy five to ninety percent of this group is willing to pay for speech recognition on a remote .
60822	0	a	Speech recognition? .
60823	0	a	Obviously , we ca not make a remote into a computer ,
60824	1	a	but maybe simple commands .
60825	0	a	I dunno ,
60826	1	a	louder , softer , on , off .
60827	0	a	That might be a possibility , even though it costs more , to be the first on the market to produce this .
60828	0	a	Thirty five percent say they are too difficult to use .
60829	1	a	So we have to figure out a way of making it more user friendly .
60830	0	a	fifty percent say they ca not find the remote half the time .
60831	1	a	So maybe one word speech recognition commands , say remote , and there is a beep beep beep ,
60832	0	a	and they can find it through , you know , ten tons of newspapers , magazines , whatever you have at home .
60833	0	a	But , in the cost that the management is looking for , that is not going to be possible .
60834	1	a	But if it is trendy , if it is fancy , it is got some colour to it , if it is very easy easy to use , if it is got simple remote speech remote control , like I said , louder , softer , change channel , on , off , remote , it goes beep beep ,
60835	0	a	I can find my my remote without spending half a day looking for it and getting all upset cause I ca not turn the TV on .
60836	1	a	So we are going to have to look at it in a in this global idea , with the ideas of the industrial design .
60837	1	a	But , price obviously we have to talk about .
60838	0	a	Yep .
60839	0	a	So what do you think about the design ?
60840	0	a	Do you think you can make it or
60841	0	a	What do you think about the design , what he was talking about of the speech recognition ?
60842	0	a	D
60843	0	a	I am sorry ?
60844	0	a	Well ,
60845	0	a	training is always an issue with commands .
60846	0	a	Speech recognition .
60847	0	a	So
60848	0	a	might
60849	0	a	we can perhaps do it if the user is willing to spend some time in the training process ,
60850	0	a	it could reduce th th the overall cost .
60851	0	a	Not sure how .
60852	0	a	But anyway , I I think also that this might impact the battery life .
60853	0	a	And so ,
60854	1	a	maybe what we will have to do is add something where you can recharge it wirelessly so that y you know sen send power to it .
60855	0	a	So
60856	1	a	or maybe set it out in the sun and it , you know , gets , from the light , a a solar cell inside there
60857	0	a	so that you have enough juice to do all these fancy things .
60858	0	a	It seems also like with the speech recognition , yeah , it is a great feature ,
60859	0	a	but if you are watching TV , there is a lot of ambient sound , and it is words .
60860	0	a	It is not just , you know , noises like something hitting .
60861	0	a	It is actual speech ,
60862	1	a	so then you have to make sure that the speech recognizer is good enough to filter out the TV speech , and the the user is speech .
60863	0	a	Otherwise , you can say remote .
60864	0	a	Off .
60865	0	a	But if someone on the screen is saying the same thing , all of a sudden , you have someone in a movie saying off and your screen dies ,
60866	0	a	because they have triggered the remote control and it is turned off your TV .
60867	0	a	So , I think if we can find a speech recognizer that can handle those types of problems , then yeah , it would be a really good marketing gimmick .
60868	1	a	But , I think we seriously need to consider how that would impact the situation .
60869	0	a	Very good point .
60870	0	a	Because tha w with speech recognition th I am not that good at that idea
60871	0	a	but th if it is a one word recognition ,
60872	0	a	cause I know with telephones and cars and things I have seen in the States , a friend of mine says call Mom , and it calls up Mom .
60873	0	a	Yeah .
60874	0	a	Yeah .
60875	0	a	Kay
60876	0	a	the radio can be on and everything .
60877	0	a	Yep .
60878	0	a	Because I think s with speech recognition , if the the remote or like the telephone it has a exact word that it has to hear .
60879	0	a	I do not think it would come through a sentence in a television .
60880	0	a	If somebody is speaking on the se the television , they are not going to stop and say remote ,
60881	0	a	okay .
60882	1	a	So I think that something could be designed to recognise single word
60883	0	a	Like the t like the telephone .
60884	0	a	Oh yeah .
60885	0	a	Yeah .
60886	0	a	No , I think it is a great idea if we can design it to to suit those requirements .
60887	0	a	No
60888	0	a	because I this is this is years ago in the United States where we are driving down
60889	0	a	and he said call home , and the telephone called immediately
60890	0	a	so well ,
60891	0	a	that is kind of cute .
60892	0	a	Yeah .
60893	0	a	Well ,
60894	1	a	what I can suggest to you , Christine ,
60895	0	a	okay ,
60896	1	a	if you need some the technical feedback , or some training , okay , about this facility , especially for the speech recognition , I can recommend you some companies like Intel or IBM ,
60897	0	a	okay ,
60898	0	a	because they are already in this speech recognition part ,
60899	0	a	okay .
60900	1	a	And you can maybe have some technical backup from them , some kind of a technical tie up .
60901	0	a	Okay ,
60902	1	a	and if you want , I can coordinate , okay , to get some information ,
60903	0	a	okay ,
60904	1	a	and you can let me know , okay ,
60905	1	a	so what kind of the details you require okay , to add this feature in this project .
60906	0	a	I do not think it is the difficult .
60907	0	a	And
60908	1	a	we need to know how much is the timeframe you need to develop , apart from what today .
60909	0	a	Okay ,
60910	1	a	we will find that out .
60911	0	a	Yep .
60912	1	a	From from your side , you are going to have to go back the management and s be more s precise .
60913	0	a	Yes .
60914	1	a	What do they want ?
60915	0	a	, a risk , take a risk on the market ?
60916	0	a	Something that is going to cost more , but could very easily s make a boom in the market ?
60917	1	a	Because it has to be something totally different , has to be total totally new .
60918	0	a	Yes .
60919	0	a	Yes .
60920	0	a	Yep .
60921	1	a	Something that nobody has right now .
60922	0	a	Yeah
60923	0	a	but
60924	0	a	but end of the day , you are the sales guy ,
60925	1	a	so I will come back and sit on your head
60926	0	a	because you are going to give your sales projection ,
60927	0	a	okay .
60928	0	a	And it is going to cost .
60929	1	a	It is of course it is good to tell the management how much it is cost us and how much you are going to benefit ,
60930	0	a	okay .
60931	0	a	Sure .
60932	0	a	Sure .
60933	0	a	And , so
60934	1	a	I do not mind to convince , okay , the management to spend some more money on the project , okay , if you can make out of the money from this project .
60935	0	a	Obviously .
60936	0	a	If the bottom line is positive .
60937	0	a	Yes ,
60938	0	a	okay
60939	1	a	I do not mind to convince the the management ,
60940	0	a	okay .
60941	0	a	The management says , okay , so they they do not want certain facilities , which it is already worked ,
60942	0	a	okay ,
60943	0	a	they want something new ,
60944	0	a	okay .
60945	0	a	I think like speech recognit definitely they will agree , I do not think they will say no for that ,
60946	0	a	okay .
60947	0	a	And I hope I can convince the management on that ,
60948	0	a	okay .
60949	0	a	So
60950	1	a	if you have any new ideas , okay , for your you can always come up and you can tell me if you need any s special , okay , coordination , okay , between any technical companies ,
60951	0	a	which you can hide their technology backup , okay , for your functional design or technical design ,
60952	0	a	okay ,
60953	1	a	then I am ready to do that .
60954	0	a	And what is your comments about
60955	0	a	Yeah ,
60956	0	a	so you are finish , Ed ,
60957	0	a	so I can
60958	0	a	Okay ,
60959	1	a	I will hand over to Agnes .
60960	0	a	well , I mean ,
60961	1	a	maybe if I go through my presentation , you can sort of see what the user perspective is , and how it ties into the other two comments .
60962	0	a	Yes .
60963	1	a	Just going to close this .
60964	0	a	T
60965	0	a	where are you , here ?
60966	0	a	Participant three .
60967	0	a	participant three .
60968	0	a	Nope ,
60969	0	a	here
60970	0	a	Good .
60971	0	a	Okay ,
60972	0	a	so I will yep .
60973	0	a	Okay .
60974	0	a	Thanks .
60975	0	a	Is it okay ?
60976	0	a	Alri
60977	0	a	Click .
60978	0	a	Yeah , and that is fine .
60979	0	a	Okay .
60980	0	a	So , basically ,
60981	0	a	the method that we usually use in the user interface design is that we need to look at what people like and what people do not like about existing products .
60982	0	a	So , in our case , existing remote controls .
60983	0	a	And then , what the good ideas are , and what the bad ideas are , and why they are bad and good , which is not always as obvious .
60984	0	a	We seem to have intuitions about why things are good or things are bad , but when you look , technically , at how it works , sometimes that is not the case .
60985	1	a	Then we need to decide what functionalities we really want to keep ,
60986	0	a	cause that will feed into both Ed is work and Christine is work .
60987	1	a	and then what the remote control should look like , obviously , once we have got a good idea of what the functionalities are .
60988	0	a	So ,
60989	1	a	in terms of the functionalities that we need , you obviously need to be able to turn the TV on and off .
60990	1	a	You need to change channels , both by directly going to a specific channel or by channel surfing .
60991	1	a	You need to be able to control the volume and then control any menus on the TV to regulate contrast or whatever .
60992	0	a	So ,
60993	0	a	the problems that people have expressed is that there is too many buttons on remote controls , in general .
60994	0	a	The buttons it is not clear what they are supposed to do .
60995	0	a	often , you need to know specific button sequences to get certain functionalities done , which you do not necessarily always remember , especially if it is a functionality that you do not use very often .
60996	0	a	And that the buttons are too small .
60997	0	a	So ,
60998	0	a	here we have got two examples where here on the left hand side , you can see a remote control that has lots and lots of buttons .
60999	0	a	The buttons , in a lot of cases , are tiny .
61000	0	a	they are hard to see , and okay ,
61001	0	a	they are labelled ,
61002	0	a	but the labels do not necessarily tell you too much .
61003	0	a	Whereas , on the other side , you have a much simpler remote control that I think basically has the minimum functionalities that are needed .
61004	0	a	And it sort of looks simpler and just less imposing when you first look at it .
61005	1	a	So , I would be inclined to go sort of towards this , in terms of design , rather than this .
61006	1	a	And if there is specific functionalities that require more buttons , then we can figure out how to do it with existing buttons .
61007	1	a	So my personal preferences are to keep the number of buttons to a limit , or to a minimum ,
61008	0	a	sorry ,
61009	1	a	make frequently used buttons bigger and more strategically placed , so like the on button being really obvious one , the channel changing and the volume , and to keep the design basically sleek and simple .
61010	0	a	Which , I think ties into what Christine and Ed have both said fairly reasonably .
61011	0	a	so ,
61012	0	a	that is pretty much it ,
61013	0	a	an
61014	0	a	I do not know if you guys have any questions or
61015	0	a	Yep .
61016	0	a	Oh ,
61017	0	a	it is , seems very understandable .
61018	0	a	Clearly your research and and ours heading in the same direction ,
61019	0	a	and
61020	0	a	the only thing that I saw missing from your your research that we found was this ability to find the doggone thing when you need it .
61021	0	a	Yes , that is true .
61022	0	a	So , you know ,
61023	0	a	but that is okay .
61024	0	a	Yeah .
61025	0	a	That is why we are all here at the table , so that if we think of it and our research indicates certain things and w we it is complementary .
61026	0	a	Yeah .
61027	0	a	I also think that th f the the feel of it is , when you hold it , is something that was expressed more in in in in my design
61028	0	a	and that is logical and normal cause those are the parameters that an Industrial Designer is more thinking about , th th the look and the feel ,
61029	0	a	and , you are
61030	0	a	First .
61031	0	a	Yeah .
61032	0	a	Yeah .
61033	0	a	Oh ,
61034	0	a	that is definitely a very important factor , especially to users who are going to be buying the thing and then using it almost on an daily basis in a lot of cases , I think .
61035	0	a	Yep .
61036	0	a	Okay ,
61037	0	a	so I do not have any questions .
61038	0	a	Sounds good .
61039	0	a	So
61040	1	a	for anybody need any help , for time being , on this subjects , okay , so please come back to me ,
61041	1	a	and Christine , maybe I can try to help you to get some the technical the companies
61042	0	a	to help you for make a design slim ,
61043	0	a	okay ,
61044	0	a	and to add some features , like we are talking about , the speech recognition and all .
61045	0	a	Oh
61046	1	a	Should we maybe make a decision about what features we actually want to include ,
61047	0	a	cause we have thrown a lot of features onto the table ,
61048	0	a	but
61049	0	a	do we actually want to incorporate all of them ,
61050	1	a	or have we missed anything ?
61051	0	a	Sure .
61052	0	a	Yeah .
61053	1	a	Do you want to go back and look at the closing slide ,
61054	0	a	maybe that would provide some guidance ?
61055	0	a	Does not really tell us .
61056	0	a	So
61057	0	a	not really
61058	0	a	this one we are talk ab
61059	0	a	Yep .
61060	0	a	Individual actions .
61061	0	a	Well
61062	0	a	it says individual actions , it says user interf
61063	0	a	so I am supposed to do the components concept , supposed to work on the user interface concept , and you are supposed to keep watching the trends .
61064	0	a	and specific instructions will be sent by our our coach .
61065	1	a	I think we should do as many features as start with all of them right now and eliminate them later in the process ,
61066	0	a	that is my suggestion .
61067	0	a	I thought
61068	0	a	No , I I am just thinking in terms of time ,
61069	0	a	like if
61070	0	a	Yes , now I am objecting .
61071	0	a	Okay , that will be great .
61072	1	a	And I will send you the the minutes of meet
61073	0	a	Yeah .
61074	0	a	You can object if you want to
61075	1	a	I think we should take that as an action item for after the meeting ,
61076	0	a	cause w our meeting time has run out .
61077	0	a	She is objecting .
61078	0	a	No ,
61079	0	a	I mean ,
61080	0	a	I was just thinking is it really practical to start designing something with features that we are just going to end up throwing away ?
61081	0	a	I mean , it takes a lot of time and effort for everyone to consider different features ,
61082	1	a	and s if we spend that time and effort on features that we are not going to use , maybe it is better to spend it on the f thinking more about features that we actually do want ,
61083	0	a	but guess
61084	0	a	Sure .
61085	0	a	Oh
61086	0	a	th we s we still have
61087	0	a	Yeah .
61088	0	a	Right .
61089	0	a	Somebody else has go to use this room , and , you know , we ca not hang out here and talk about this , so
61090	0	a	Yeah .
61091	0	a	Yeah .
61092	0	a	Sure .
61093	0	a	Okay ,
61094	1	a	what we will do is now we will take for lunch break ,
61095	0	a	okay ,
61096	1	a	then we can discuss furthermore , okay , with our areas , and then we will come back again in the in the next meeting .
61097	0	a	So thanks for coming
61098	1	a	and I will send you minutes of meeting ,
61099	1	a	and please put your all information in the sharing folder
61100	0	a	so everybody can share the information .
61101	0	a	Okay ?
61102	1	a	So let is go for lunch then .
61103	0	a	 
61104	0	a	welcome back after lunch , I hope you had a good lunch together .
61105	0	a	For this meeting the main agenda okay to discuss about the conceptual design meeting .
61106	0	a	Okay and the agenda will be the opening and that is the product manager or secretary that is me and the presentations from the Christine and Agnes and from Mister Ed .
61107	0	a	And finally in this meeting we have to decide
61108	0	a	and we are to take a decision on the remote control concept and the functional design
61109	0	a	So we have forty minutes ,
61110	0	a	I think it is little bit low ,
61111	0	a	but I
61112	0	a	I hope we can finish it up
61113	0	a	so I will handle to the the functional team , to the Christine , okay , to discuss about the components concept .
61114	0	a	Okay .
61115	1	a	So , if you could open the PowerPoint presentation .
61116	0	a	I am number two .
61117	0	a	You are number two .
61118	0	a	Kay
61119	0	a	The next one .
61120	0	a	Components design , there we go .
61121	1	a	So can we put it in slide show mode ?
61122	0	a	Yeah .
61123	0	a	Right here ,
61124	0	a	is that little
61125	0	a	that one ,
61126	0	a	yes please .
61127	0	a	Thank you .
61128	1	a	I will take the mouse .
61129	0	a	So
61130	0	a	we were looking he specifically at the components the following components , the case , the power supply , the means of communications with the television set .
61131	0	a	In instance we had talked about using some sort of speech recognition , you have to have microphone
61132	0	a	well
61133	0	a	no you do not actually
61134	0	a	I have not have to have microphone in the device ,
61135	0	a	but
61136	0	a	maybe you do have it a a way
61137	0	a	it has to it has to hear the speaker
61138	0	a	and ,
61139	0	a	so it could be in the television set , could be in the device , but somewhere you have to put the microphone , and a w a way of making beeps or sounds so you can find it when it is gets lost .
61140	0	a	so the other w thing that we So .
61141	0	a	Our method for going about this is we have looked at the histo hi historical record , what is worked , what has not
61142	0	a	and then we also we wanted to evaluate some new materials
61143	0	a	and we contacted manufacturing for their input
61144	0	a	because , course , we m might come up and choose the material that then manufacturing did not have the technologies or capabilities to offer us ,
61145	0	a	so
61146	0	a	this is the approach that we took during our our research .
61147	0	a	So for the case , we told we were making a specifica specific assumption that it would be curved in design .
61148	0	a	Course , you know , I wanted it to be expandable and shrinkable , but that does not seem to b be one of the choic non option we can we can really seriously explore , so then we were thinking about rubber , but unfortunately that is been eliminated because of the heat factor and th there might be some problems with the m how it is goes with the board .
61149	0	a	and then th plastic also has this problem of melting and it is brittle it gets brittle after a while
61150	0	a	, so we still had titanium and and wood available , but unfortunately titanium is also been eliminated , the m people in manufacturing said that you could not make d curved cases out of titanium , although how Apple did it with th PowerBook
61151	0	a	I am not su quite sure
61152	0	a	but
61153	0	a	nevertheless they have eliminated all of our options except wood .
61154	0	a	So , this is our finding .
61155	0	a	At least it is environmentally friendly .
61156	0	a	And a as she said , it is an environmentally friendly material ,
61157	0	a	so we are we are currently proposing ,
61158	0	a	we will get to all my personal preferences in just a second .
61159	0	a	So then there is this other matter of the chips and well we could use a simple design on the board , these simple chips , but that is only works for the bu you do not get very much intelligence with this simple one .
61160	0	a	And then there was the regular which I regret that I have forgotten exactly why I am eliminating that one .
61161	0	a	the other option was this advanced chip on print ,
61162	0	a	and we liked th we
61163	0	a	we found that it it includes this infrared sender , which w amember the beam was that was an important component of finding the right chip .
61164	0	a	And manufacturing has told us that they have recently developed a a sensor and a speaker that would be integrated into this advanced chip on print ,
61165	0	a	so we we
61166	0	a	now jumping right to our personal preferences I
61167	0	a	I would really think we should , you know , use some of some really exotic woods , like ,
61168	1	a	you know , well you guys come from tropical countries so you can kind of think of some trees and some nice woods .
61169	0	a	I think that people will might really want to design their own cases , you see , they could do sort of a this three dimensional design on the internet , and then they could submit their orders , kind of like you submit a custom car order , you know , and you can choose the colour and the size of the wheels and the colours of the leather and things like that , and then I think we should go with the solar cells as well as the microphone and speaker on the advanced chip .
61170	0	a	So this is the findings of our research and my recommendations for the new remote control w would be to have have it be made out of wood .
61171	0	a	Do you have any problems with that ?
61172	0	a	I am not sure , how do I
61173	0	a	Oh , I know , let is see .
61174	1	a	Can you go back one slide ?
61175	0	a	Yes ,
61176	0	a	question , , what is mean exactly , advanced chip on print ?
61177	0	a	What is the meaning of that ?
61178	0	a	Thank you .
61179	0	a	Let is go back up here .
61180	0	a	Yeah .
61181	0	a	I think it is a multiple chip design and it is maybe printed on to the circuit board .
61182	1	a	I could find out more about that before the next fi next meeting .
61183	0	a	Yeah ,
61184	0	a	is it means it is on the yeah
61185	0	a	is it on a micro proc micro processor based or
61186	0	a	Okay , tha that would be great ,
61187	1	a	so if you find out from the technology background , okay ,
61188	0	a	so that would be good .
61189	0	a	I do not know ,
61190	1	a	but I will find out more at our next meeting .
61191	0	a	Sounds good .
61192	0	a	Why was the plastic eliminated as a possible material ?
61193	0	a	Because it gets brittle , cracks
61194	0	a	We want
61195	0	a	we expect these these remote controls to be around for several hundred years .
61196	0	a	So .
61197	0	a	Good ex Good expression .
61198	0	a	Whic Which
61199	0	a	Although I think
61200	0	a	I think with wood though you would run into the same types of problems ,
61201	0	a	would not you ,
61202	0	a	I mean it chips , it if you drop it ,
61203	0	a	it is I am not su
61204	0	a	I think if you re if you use really good quality wood , then it might work ,
61205	0	a	but you ca not just use
61206	0	a	Yeah , exactly
61207	0	a	, yeah .
61208	0	a	Wow ,
61209	0	a	good expression .
61210	0	a	Well after us .
61211	0	a	I do not know , speak for yourself , I am planning to be around for a while .
61212	0	a	So so you are not convinced about the the wood , yes .
61213	0	a	Actually , I am ready to sell it .
61214	0	a	you are what ?
61215	0	a	You think ?
61216	1	a	And you could you could sell oils with it , to take care of it .
61217	0	a	I am ready to sell it .
61218	0	a	No y no
61219	0	a	no no ,
61220	0	a	the o the only w the only wood you can use are the ones that are hard , extremely hard wood , but there are some very pretty woods out there .
61221	0	a	Well I am glad you
61222	0	a	Okay , good .
61223	0	a	That is actually very innovative idea .
61224	0	a	Sorr having a hard time keeping wi control over my face .
61225	0	a	Well , it is actually a very innovative n different idea that you know you can choose your colour of wood , your type of wood .
61226	0	a	The stain .
61227	0	a	I mean it is each person is going to have their own personalised , individualised speech recognition remote control in wood , that is not on the market .
61228	0	a	Yeah , so it it is looks good the the design the functional design ,
61229	0	a	what about yo you ?
61230	0	a	Yes , in t yes , in term in terms of comments first
61231	0	a	Okay then , , let is move to Agnes .
61232	0	a	in terms of comments on this or in terms of my own
61233	0	a	Y
61234	0	a	yeah .
61235	0	a	In turns of wow .
61236	0	a	She works in the cubicle next to me so she is she was already a little bit prepared for this .
61237	0	a	Luckily Ed was not .
61238	0	a	Wood ?
61239	0	a	They do that anyway with the rubber and plastic ,
61240	0	a	so , and chew them up .
61241	0	a	I think we can get the quality materials then it should not influence the design principles too much , which you will see with my presentation .
61242	1	a	One thing we would have to check though is what the users whether how quickly the novelty wears off of having
61243	0	a	Yeah , for example .
61244	0	a	Yeah ,
61245	0	a	you would not want to have to have splinters in your hand while you are using your
61246	0	a	It is really good if your dog gets ahold of it , they can use it for teething .
61247	0	a	So ,
61248	1	a	have to see how kid friendly it is and and all that ,
61249	0	a	but
61250	0	a	Sure .
61251	0	a	Yeah , they do it with other materials as well ,
61252	0	a	yeah .
61253	0	a	And chew them up .
61254	0	a	Oh , I am sorry .
61255	0	a	S you are
61256	0	a	You are in participant three .
61257	0	a	One point three , yeah
61258	0	a	, yeah .
61259	0	a	This one ?
61260	0	a	So what is your , , the comments or s
61261	0	a	Okay
61262	0	a	I think so , yeah .
61263	0	a	Yeah , that is the one .
61264	0	a	So , it is a very short presentation , cause I am actually going to draw you the layout on the board
61265	1	a	so if you want to just go straight to the second slide ,
61266	0	a	, which basically shows , sort of
61267	0	a	I took the ideas that we were talking about last time and tried to put that into the remote control so the things that y you can actually see on it are the on off switch , volume and channel control , the menu access button , ergonomic shape ,
61268	0	a	which I completely agree with Christine is idea to have it sort of molded , so it is slightly more ergonomic and comfortable to hold than the r standard very straight remote controls .
61269	0	a	And actually the other thing with the wood if we take your customising idea , is that people can actually do sort of quasi measurements on their hand size , so if someone has larger hands , you have a wider remote control .
61270	0	a	Right ,
61271	0	a	my hand is different size than yours for example .
61272	0	a	So , that is actually a really good idea for customi customisability .
61273	1	a	, one thing I thought might be kind of interesting is to put a flip screen on it , just like you have on flip phones ,
61274	0	a	so that you do not have this case where someone sits on the remote control or accidentally puts their hand on it , especially if you have little kids around , they are not pressing the buttons while you are trying to watch a TV show and accidentally change the channel or turn it off .
61275	0	a	And also you had issues with the batteries running out ,
61276	1	a	so I thought maybe we could put a little battery life light on it that kind of goes dimmer and dimmer and dimmer as your battery is starts to die .
61277	1	a	And in terms of invisible features , audio and tactile feedback on button presses and , like you said , speech recognition .
61278	1	a	So , in terms of what this thing would actually look like
61279	0	a	Despite working in interface design , I am not the greatest artist in the world , so you will have to forgive me .
61280	0	a	You would have something like this with an on off switch fairly big , sort of in the corner and by itself , so you do not accidentally turn your TV off while you are trying to manoeuvre other buttons .
61281	0	a	And then you have sort of one of those toggle displays for , oops , channels and volume , sort of for surfing channels and then volume , so the volume would be the up and down , cause volume goes up and down and then channels left to right .
61282	0	a	And then here you would have your sort of standard , telephonish number pad .
61283	0	a	And then on one side you would have an access to the menu on your TV and on the other side a way to turn off the voice control .
61284	0	a	So that if the user does not want to use their voice , they can just turn it off and you do not have the remote control accidentally changing things on you .
61285	0	a	, so again you can have a little LCD light somewhere , the flip thing and
61286	0	a	Have I forgotten anything ?
61287	0	a	I do not think so .
61288	0	a	So , as you can see , it is a very very simple design , which is one of the things I really wanted to keep , is keep it simple , not have too many buttons , not have too many functionalities thrown into it .
61289	0	a	No .
61290	0	a	Think the design can pretty much carry over to everything ,
61291	1	a	although with the wood the flip screen might have to do something slightly different .
61292	1	a	A hinge .
61293	1	a	Be like a copper hinge or you know .
61294	0	a	Yeah .
61295	0	a	But you also have to d start watching out for the weight , cause depending on how much the the flip screen will add to the weight of the remote control , you do not want it to start getting too heavy .
61296	0	a	But that is the general layout with the general functionalities , if we come up with something else .
61297	0	a	As you can see , there is still lots of space on the actual remote control and if you do it customisably , you can make this thing fairly small or fairly o large , depending on personal preferences .
61298	0	a	So , that is pretty much all I had to say ,
61299	0	a	I mean , everything else in terms of design issues .
61300	0	a	the centering of the key pad and the channel is just depending on where your thumb is and you tend to use the the volume control and the browsing more than the actual number pad , so that would be sort of in direct line of where your thumb goes when you are holding the remote control , the number pad a little bit lower cause it is used less frequently .
61301	0	a	So once we decide exactly what we want , then we can figure out the exact positioning , but more or less I think it should go along those lines .
61302	0	a	Simple design .
61303	0	a	It is what consumers want .
61304	0	a	It is almost like , Houston , we have a product here .
61305	0	a	Problem is obviously going to be cost .
61306	0	a	Okay ,
61307	0	a	I also have a f very simple presentation , because for the marketing point you have to see what the consumers want .
61308	0	a	Yeah .
61309	0	a	Yeah .
61310	0	a	I also have copied a different type of remote .
61311	1	a	If you can find me , where I am at .
61312	0	a	There should only be one in here .
61313	0	a	trend watch .
61314	1	a	Sure .
61315	0	a	It is being modified .
61316	0	a	They are stealing our product .
61317	0	a	We have been giving simple questionnaires in different areas because th obviously we have to see what the com consumers are looking for today , cause trends change very very quickly .
61318	0	a	In six months maybe this idea is already gone out the window , so it is going to be a question how fast we can act .
61319	0	a	they already erased the rest of mine , huh .
61320	0	a	No ,
61321	1	a	f go to findings .
61322	0	a	No , no .
61323	0	a	No no , no no .
61324	0	a	Cause I had another comment there .
61325	0	a	the market trend .
61326	0	a	This is what we know from the last from the questionnaires from the the all the p surveys we have done , fancy and feel good , that is what we have been looking for , something that feels good in the hand , that is easy to use .
61327	0	a	Looking for next generation of innovation , because all the remotes out there now , they are all very similar , they all do the same thing , we have to have something completely different .
61328	0	a	Okay ?
61329	0	a	Easy to use , has always has become has become another major interest that ,
61330	0	a	with the whiteboard we can see that it is a remote that is easy to use .
61331	0	a	And I think this is another thing that is interesting is the consumers actually willing to pay the price for exciting tel technology .
61332	0	a	So even if we have a product that may be more expensive , if it comes out right , if they look it looks and feels good and has technology .
61333	0	a	The second two , you can see the last one is a very easy simple design .
61334	0	a	The second one , there is about forty five thousand different buttons on it , which makes it fairly hard to read , very hard to use .
61335	0	a	The first one , I see that they put in a display .
61336	0	a	Now there is something else with the little flip up , now we are adding all kinds of things in ,
61337	1	a	but with the little flip up , if you have a little display on the flip up that when you close it everything is locked .
61338	0	a	Yeah .
61339	0	a	Maybe the display also makes it easier to use , because sometimes when you are looking for buttons , maybe if you see a display
61340	0	a	Okay
61341	0	a	Because I have seen mostly the standard ones ,
61342	0	a	yeah .
61343	1	a	Context sensitive instructions , depending on what the tel what mode the TV or the DVD or something else is in .
61344	0	a	Right .
61345	0	a	Especially you might need something like that for training the speech recognition and
61346	0	a	Now you have it now
61347	0	a	you have one with the very simple also .
61348	0	a	The idea is simple , but with a display , so you can see what you are doing .
61349	1	a	So maybe if we can incorporate the easiness of use , trendy , fancy , feels good , with a display , wood , designer wood , designer colours
61350	0	a	, we might have
61351	1	a	You know , maybe what you could do is when somebody orders the device id you could send them like a b some sort of a foam rubber ball , and then they would squeeze it , and it would take the shape of their hand .
61352	0	a	Oh yeah .
61353	0	a	Yeah , so it is really molded to to your specific
61354	0	a	But th for that you would also have to do sort of an average across families and things like that if unless everyone has their own personal remote .
61355	0	a	To t an
61356	0	a	and then you would know like what the geometry of their hands would be and
61357	0	a	Yes you would know what kind of wood to get .
61358	0	a	How hard they squeeze ?
61359	0	a	Resistance resistance , right .
61360	0	a	That is right , that is right , you would not want to go too far down that .
61361	0	a	Oh that that actually would increase the the revenues we could expect , yeah .
61362	0	a	The sales , yeah .
61363	0	a	The
61364	0	a	Yeah .
61365	0	a	I hope so .
61366	0	a	No , but incorporating the three obviously it would be something totally new on the market , totally different
61367	0	a	and from Although , what it was it
61368	0	a	it was Nokia that came out with this changeable colours .
61369	0	a	Yeah .
61370	0	a	Well , already the customisability is a really good sort of new gimmick .
61371	0	a	Right , you take it apart , and put on another face , take it off and put on another face
61372	0	a	and then they sold millions , millions .
61373	0	a	Yeah .
61374	0	a	Yeah .
61375	0	a	Right , .
61376	0	a	And that took off , yeah ,
61377	0	a	yeah .
61378	0	a	So .
61379	0	a	So say with the f with the findings , with the research , easy to use something totally new .
61380	0	a	We have to come up with something totally new that is not on the market .
61381	1	a	We would also have to wor consider that who we were going to get to make these custom cases in terms of manufacturing processes , we might want to learn about labour laws .
61382	0	a	You know in different countries and stuff wher
61383	0	a	so we can do it cheap , but you do not want to exploit labour in third world countries .
61384	0	a	Yeah .
61385	1	a	So actually you could turn it y turn around and say that you are par the reason the cost is high for the device is because you are paying a a working wage to the person who made the device .
61386	0	a	Yeah , but we can get a production in , , countries like , , India
61387	0	a	yes , yes ,
61388	0	a	countries like India or China or Malaysia , so you can go a better features and better price and you can sell more .
61389	0	a	Cost of living is low .
61390	0	a	So
61391	0	a	Yeah ,
61392	0	a	yeah ,
61393	0	a	so
61394	0	a	Yes .
61395	0	a	Good ,
61396	0	a	well th that would be something that manufacturing would have to explore more
61397	0	a	and to where
61398	0	a	yeah .
61399	0	a	Where w Where it would be manufactured is is another step .
61400	0	a	So Yeah , so
61401	0	a	Yes ,
61402	0	a	but that that we can that we can talk about the production later , okay , depends on the the quantity , okay .
61403	0	a	We are here to design , come up with a nice product .
61404	0	a	Yeah .
61405	0	a	So we do not need to have our own fabric factory or something , so we can have a tie up with who the do the fabric , okay , for the different electronics items , then we can have a business tie up and to get to cut the cost , okay , to sell more .
61406	0	a	So ,
61407	1	a	but le let is decide first about the components concept and interface concept , okay ,
61408	0	a	if is acceptable for both of you , what Ed was talking .
61409	0	a	And your design whether you want with the display or without display or just a simple , so
61410	0	a	Yeah .
61411	0	a	I think it depends ,
61412	0	a	I mean I think it is a good idea ,
61413	0	a	but we need to really think about how useful it is going to be because theoretically with the TV you already have a big display right in front of you .
61414	1	a	So , if we are trying to keep costs down , then maybe sacrificing the display is a way to go .
61415	0	a	I mean it depends on how much putting a display costs and what it would be used for very specifically what it would be used for , cause if it is only used for one little thing , then putting in a big display case or a big display that is probably expensive just to do the training on the chip for the speech recognition or whatever , may not be the most cost efficient way to go ,
61416	0	a	but that is just sort of speculation , I mean .
61417	0	a	What do you think Ed ?
61418	0	a	Do you
61419	0	a	he liked the display in one of the concepts that you showed ,
61420	0	a	do you know how much it costs , , to to add a little display like this ?
61421	1	a	Do you want to take an action item to go find out ?
61422	0	a	Okay .
61423	0	a	No .
61424	0	a	No
61425	0	a	no p spec
61426	0	a	It is cause we have to find out cost on it .
61427	0	a	Sorry about that .
61428	0	a	, no that is no problem .
61429	0	a	I am here for the pushing it after it is made .
61430	0	a	Yes .
61431	0	a	I will market it .
61432	0	a	Once we get a price on it then we can market it .
61433	0	a	So the the advanced chip on print is what what we have we have deci we have determined and the engineering industrial design is the recommendation , and I think we have kind of come to some agreement regarding this concept of a wooden case .
61434	0	a	A customisable and
61435	0	a	I do not think so , no , I think they could be rubber like they are now , so you have that tactile experience of
61436	0	a	So
61437	0	a	are we done with this meeting ?
61438	0	a	Nice beautiful mahogany red wooden case .
61439	0	a	What about the buttons , would Would the buttons be wood too , or
61440	0	a	I do not think so .
61441	0	a	Yes .
61442	0	a	Yes .
61443	0	a	Do not looks nice .
61444	0	a	Yeah , so
61445	0	a	what we will do is , , we will stick with the the simple design for time being until th Ed find outs about the how much
61446	0	a	it is cost to the extra , in case we go for the display .
61447	0	a	Okay .
61448	0	a	So
61449	1	a	maybe what you can do is , both of you , you can come up with the the prototype , okay , the model .
61450	0	a	Okay .
61451	0	a	Okay ?
61452	0	a	Yeah , I hope ,
61453	0	a	if
61454	0	a	is it okay if they will come up with the prototype design , okay .
61455	0	a	Sure .
61456	1	a	Then they can show you how it looks like ,
61457	0	a	and then we can submit to the
61458	0	a	I will submit to the management .
61459	0	a	Okay ?
61460	0	a	Then meantime you can come up with the price , how much it is cost as extra for the display .
61461	0	a	An and the marketing strategy , that is very important , okay .
61462	0	a	And marketing strategy , thank you .
61463	0	a	Yes .
61464	0	a	How much you can
61465	0	a	how mu how much how much you can sell extra .
61466	0	a	Of course you will make money too , so it it is not only pay out , you make money too , your commission .
61467	1	a	Okay , so , any questions ?
61468	0	a	So , by next meeting , so , please come up with the the prototype , okay , then , then we can proceed from there .
61469	0	a	No .
61470	0	a	Okay .
61471	0	a	It is okay ?
61472	0	a	So thanks for all your efforts and coming for the meeting again , and see you soon then .
61473	0	a	Okay ?
61474	0	a	 
61475	0	a	I am sorry to be late .
61476	0	a	Welcome back .
61477	0	a	Welcome back everybody .
61478	0	a	Yeah .
61479	0	a	Thanks .
61480	0	a	So this meeting agenda will be the detailed design meeting .
61481	0	a	And opening and PMs of the meet minutes , prototype presentation from Christine and Agnes .
61482	0	a	Agnes , yes .
61483	0	a	Yes
61484	0	a	and evaluation criteria .
61485	0	a	The finance , it is from my side , from the management , and production evaluation .
61486	0	a	Then closing .
61487	0	a	So we have forty minutes to discuss and finalise and close the product and project and to move further , okay ,
61488	0	a	so
61489	1	a	Okay , let is talk about maybe first for the prototype .
61490	1	a	, okay .
61491	1	a	So I handle to
61492	1	a	So shall I go to
61493	0	a	sorry .
61494	0	a	I have done a presentation , but it pretty much covers work that we have both done ,
61495	1	a	so if I am missing anything , Christine can just correct me .
61496	0	a	thank you ,
61497	0	a	so you did a PowerPoint presentation , good for you .
61498	0	a	Yep .
61499	0	a	S
61500	1	a	Okay , let is go to AMI .
61501	0	a	It is not the biggest PowerPoint presentation in the world , but
61502	0	a	Three .
61503	0	a	So in two or three or
61504	0	a	Yeah .
61505	0	a	No it is
61506	0	a	think it is the last one .
61507	1	a	Probably .
61508	1	a	Technical pa I would think .
61509	0	a	No ,
61510	0	a	then this is
61511	0	a	the la
61512	0	a	yeah , that one , final design .
61513	0	a	Ha .
61514	0	a	It is named appropriately , you just could not see the name .
61515	1	a	okay , can I have the mouse ?
61516	0	a	Thanks .
61517	1	a	Yes .
61518	0	a	Alright , so
61519	0	a	from when we were discussing specifying the case in the last meeting , we decided that we wanted an ergonomic shape , the material that we chose was wood , and the colour would be customisable , cause you can stain the wood whatever colour .
61520	0	a	so in terms of function , you have to be able to turn the TV on and off , volume and channel control , menu control , voice recognition control , and we have incorporated the LCD screen on the flip panel as part of the design , if we figure out it is too expensive ,
61521	0	a	well then you just take it off .
61522	0	a	, so
61523	1	a	to unveil our lovely product .
61524	0	a	This is our remote control , with the flip panel as you can see .
61525	0	a	So if you lift up the panel , you can see the lovely yellow LCD display .
61526	0	a	, this is actually hard to do .
61527	0	a	The yellow button you have is the on off button , so it is really big , hard to miss .
61528	0	a	You have the the red triangles are the toggles for changing the volume .
61529	0	a	So up volume up , down volume down .
61530	0	a	The green are the channel changing .
61531	0	a	S
61532	0	a	And it is one of those very light , very touchable displays .
61533	0	a	And then you have the numeric pad in the dark blue at the bottom , and on the right hand side you have the access to the menu on the TV , and on the left hand side you have the the the ability to turn off the voice recognition .
61534	0	a	So this is pretty much what we had on the white board the last time .
61535	1	a	So .
61536	0	a	and I could
61537	0	a	Yeah
61538	0	a	the d
61539	0	a	We have not specified where the speaker or the microphone will be placed .
61540	0	a	Oh yes .
61541	0	a	Additional feature on the back is that you can have your own customised backing and I suppose you could do the same thing on the flip case on the front .
61542	0	a	So that you can really make this a highly highly customisable remote control .
61543	0	a	That depends on the s design of the circuit board inside and what room is left
61544	0	a	Yes , okay .
61545	0	a	Yeah .
61546	1	a	I think the microphone is on on the top , on the middle , the under the flip .
61547	0	a	Uh huh .
61548	0	a	So that will be the safe ,
61549	0	a	so p any the chip
61550	0	a	it is not on the chip because you need to have microphone to
61551	0	a	Yes .
61552	0	a	No , I mean it depends on the design of the circuit board .
61553	0	a	But it should not be under the flip either ,
61554	0	a	because you can have the remote control closed , but you still might want to activate it by voice .
61555	0	a	it is it is
61556	0	a	Yeah , but
61557	0	a	my opinion I think it is better under the flip because whenever you want to the talk , okay , so then you can speak then you can close it .
61558	0	a	But if you put it on the on the flip , okay , then technical I do not think it is feasible , cause most of the time you speak then it will be recognised .
61559	0	a	But if you have already got the remote control in your hand you need to open the flip to use the voice , why use the voice , why not just use your hand ?
61560	0	a	I mean the whole point of the voice is that if the remote control is sitting there and I am too lazy to reach over and pick it up , I can just use my voice .
61561	1	a	Maybe I have got my hand in the popcorn bowl and I am holding my cup of Coca Cola in the other hand .
61562	0	a	Yeah .
61563	1	a	And you do not want to let go of either one .
61564	0	a	I do not want to say .
61565	0	a	Louder .
61566	0	a	Yeah .
61567	0	a	I mean it does not have to be on the flip ,
61568	1	a	it can be on the side somewhere .
61569	1	a	Can also be on the side .
61570	0	a	Yeah , the sides maybe is good .
61571	0	a	Yeah .
61572	1	a	So , I mean I can pass this around if anyone wants to
61573	0	a	Yeah .
61574	0	a	Yes .
61575	0	a	So it is maybe good idea .
61576	1	a	Yeah , y better you pass it around with a napkin .
61577	0	a	No , because y you can easily put a microphone on the side that would have no problem would have not been not be damaged or anything , and it would be accessible all the time to voice .
61578	0	a	Yes .
61579	0	a	Yeah .
61580	0	a	Yeah , exactly .
61581	0	a	Yeah .
61582	0	a	So it is maybe good idea .
61583	0	a	S s
61584	0	a	Okay .
61585	0	a	It is It is
61586	1	a	You need to work on the weight a little bit .
61587	0	a	Compliments to the artist .
61588	0	a	Yes .
61589	0	a	S
61590	0	a	I am fine , I am satisfi
61591	0	a	I am satisfied .
61592	1	a	And maybe the shape of the buttons ,
61593	0	a	the little egg shapes are not the most economical , but
61594	0	a	Yeah .
61595	0	a	We are glad you are satisfied .
61596	0	a	Of course it is it is it is looks more heo heavy , but I think when it is completely maybe it is a less weight .
61597	0	a	I mean this is plasticene .
61598	0	a	There is only so much you can do .
61599	0	a	Yes .
61600	1	a	We could have possibly made it a lot thinner as well .
61601	0	a	But
61602	0	a	And part of the thing is m a lot of people say that they do not like something that is too light , because they do not feel like they have enough control over it .
61603	0	a	So I mean maybe this is excessively heavy ,
61604	0	a	but I think it needs to have some weight , it needs to feel like you are still holding something .
61605	0	a	Yep .
61606	0	a	So that is pretty much it for our presentation actually .
61607	0	a	That is your prototype model ?
61608	0	a	Okay , that is good , thank you very much .
61609	0	a	Yeah .
61610	0	a	So any comments or
61611	0	a	Okay .
61612	0	a	Well , the prototype is is very well within the design and ideas that we have we have talked about on the previous meetings .
61613	0	a	Now it goes into this next phase as the financial marketing
61614	0	a	Well we have not come to mine yet , so
61615	0	a	we are going to have a bit of difference of opinion , yes .
61616	0	a	Yes , that So I will come back to the
61617	0	a	So evaluation criteria , I think that will be good , so then let is come to the finance ,
61618	1	a	I have some calculations which I made as for the budget .
61619	0	a	So here you can look like the energy and dynamo and kinetic and solar cells .
61620	0	a	it is optional , somewhat optional and Ed wants the chip on print , that is what we were talking about that .
61621	0	a	So then we have sample sensor and sample speaker , then we have the wood material , then special colour and push button .
61622	0	a	So it is
61623	0	a	actually , our budget was twelve point five Euro , but it is coming to nine point nine five Euro , so we are under below the budget , okay , so still we are saving some money .
61624	0	a	I think it is a good figure .
61625	0	a	Yes , great
61626	0	a	I
61627	0	a	I am surprised .
61628	0	a	Congratulations .
61629	0	a	Than thank you .
61630	0	a	Oh , okay
61631	0	a	It is going to cost a long way to c you know , cost a lot of money to market it , is it ?
61632	0	a	Thirty .
61633	1	a	So maybe it is for some money we can utilise for our marketing , for the sales , okay , and
61634	0	a	It is not .
61635	0	a	Well , it just depends on if we are going to add a o
61636	0	a	on this pr provisionary cost analysis , we do not have a LC display .
61637	0	a	LC display is going to be very expensive ,
61638	0	a	it is going to be
61639	0	a	It is not it does not say .
61640	0	a	No we do , but it is not filled in .
61641	0	a	It is number thirty .
61642	0	a	We do not have the price up there , okay , so if we add approximately two to three Euro per remote , now we are up around about twelve , twelve and a half as to what the company had initially requested .
61643	0	a	Yeah .
61644	0	a	Oh , yeah ,
61645	0	a	yeah ,
61646	0	a	you are right , sorry , yes .
61647	0	a	Yeah .
61648	0	a	Yeah .
61649	0	a	Yeah .
61650	0	a	Yeah .
61651	1	a	So that means we can put the the LCD in , yeah .
61652	1	a	Display in .
61653	0	a	But as far as production I am putting up a question because we are talking about profit also , and in mine you will see the problem with our survey , the p the possibility that how many units can be sold , what percentage of the market , etcetera etcetera because that has to be taken in into consideration .
61654	0	a	this is just production cost , it is not advertising cost , it is not transportation cost
61655	0	a	And that will inflate quite a bit the cost of the the cost of the unit for the company .
61656	0	a	Yes , so still we have twelve point five Euro .
61657	0	a	Yes .
61658	0	a	Yeah , but
61659	0	a	Yes .
61660	0	a	Yep .
61661	0	a	Um hmm .
61662	0	a	So to come up with what the company wants is a fifty million Pound profit , we are going to have to go a long ways .
61663	0	a	Yes .
61664	0	a	This we are talking about one unit , okay , so when it go into the quantity , okay , and the cost will come down .
61665	0	a	Yes .
61666	0	a	Slightly .
61667	0	a	Although customisation , because this is being done , you know , the on on order basis , it might be the the quantity wo not m wo not the circuit board will b you are right , would be in producing quantity , but the cost of the case would be fixed at the
61668	0	a	you got some pretty cheap labour that can do this case for one Euro .
61669	0	a	Yeah .
61670	0	a	It is going to be very hard to reduce .
61671	0	a	Yes .
61672	0	a	That is not bad .
61673	0	a	That is really
61674	0	a	that is the cost of the material and lab
61675	0	a	wow , that is really outstanding .
61676	0	a	Yep .
61677	0	a	Yeah .
61678	0	a	But anyhow , still we are under control , okay ,
61679	1	a	so what I will do is I will try to negotiate with the vendors , okay , to get the production cost less , okay ,
61680	0	a	so then we can save some money , okay , to put into th our marketing or you know the promotions , whatever , okay ,
61681	1	a	so that I will look after .
61682	1	a	I will speak to the management and how to get you know some more cost down .
61683	1	a	If we can go to to my display .
61684	0	a	And we will come back to yours
61685	1	a	just to give everybody an idea of the market .
61686	0	a	Yes .
61687	0	a	So now I am going to scare everybody out of this project .
61688	0	a	If I am still here .
61689	0	a	You are in four ?
61690	0	a	TrendWatch .
61691	0	a	Yep
61692	0	a	The four gives me
61693	0	a	it is gotta be TrendWatch .
61694	0	a	Is this the same one you did before ?
61695	0	a	Okay .
61696	0	a	No .
61697	0	a	It should not be if it is not it is not the right one .
61698	0	a	That is no , I think it is the same one .
61699	0	a	No , no we g no
61700	0	a	, that is the same one .
61701	1	a	You have to go back and find another one .
61702	1	a	Whatever name it popped up under .
61703	1	a	functional , try functional ,
61704	0	a	it might not be it either , but we will see .
61705	1	a	Functional .
61706	0	a	It looks like it ,
61707	0	a	there is
61708	0	a	S
61709	0	a	Yeah .
61710	0	a	Yep , that is it .
61711	1	a	So we will go screen by screen .
61712	0	a	Okay .
61713	0	a	Although
61714	0	a	since we need to have some type of idea on a market we had independent study that says it
61715	0	a	this this market has an availability to absorb eight mi eight million units per year .
61716	0	a	Okay ?
61717	0	a	Our internal company evaluation puts it between eight to nine million which is approximately the same as the independent study .
61718	0	a	Yep .
61719	1	a	So if we continue ,
61720	0	a	we will look at the findings .
61721	1	a	Next screen .
61722	0	a	Which means that if we have a target of two million would the company has to take twenty five percent of the market in the first year , which is actually a tremendous amount .
61723	0	a	Yeah , no kidding .
61724	0	a	No kidding , yeah .
61725	1	a	Mayb maybe they already expected something .
61726	0	a	So ,
61727	1	a	if we put an inflated price of fifty Euro at a production cost that cannot exceed twenty five Euro ,
61728	0	a	okay , we are already in that that price , okay , with transport , promotion , labour , because we hav gi included the promotion in the cost , transport for the material to the stores or whatever how however we are going to break this down between our our retailers .
61729	0	a	Yes .
61730	0	a	Um hmm .
61731	0	a	Twenty five percent of the market to get to two million units .
61732	0	a	At two million units , we have to have a profit of twenty five Euro per unit to get to the fifty million unit Eu Euro profit .
61733	0	a	Yep .
61734	0	a	Okay ?
61735	0	a	So , obviously we w w
61736	0	a	I just did a run down the evaluation of the form , the fan the fancy stylishness of the of the unit , the ease of use , speech recognition , cost , we have gone through these .
61737	0	a	Now , the company must evaluate the feasibility of being able to take enough of the market to justify in production .
61738	1	a	Or we project this over two years ,
61739	0	a	but being that the market changes very very quickly , maybe there is no more interest in buying this thing in eighteen months from now .
61740	0	a	Yes .
61741	0	a	Yep .
61742	1	a	So , now we have to come up with a decision .
61743	0	a	Of course .
61744	0	a	Can the company sell two million units ?
61745	0	a	Can it sell it for fifty Euros ?
61746	0	a	S Upscale technology .
61747	0	a	Yep .
61748	1	a	Could could I go to findings ?
61749	1	a	I would like to explore the possibility of using alternative delivery and sales channel
61750	1	a	which would be to use the internet for promotion and ordering and then to drop ship the p product to the customer is residence .
61751	0	a	Yep .
61752	0	a	Yes .
61753	0	a	I was thinking the same thing , yeah .
61754	0	a	Directly .
61755	0	a	That way you have no storage , you have no you do have transportation , still have the labour cost , but you do not have the transport to the point of sale .
61756	0	a	Um hmm .
61757	0	a	Yes .
61758	0	a	Yeah .
61759	0	a	The point of sale is online .
61760	0	a	To the agents .
61761	0	a	Yeah .
61762	1	a	You can do a shipping centre somewhere , or strategically place shipping centres to minimise distance costs .
61763	0	a	Right , like Amazon .
61764	1	a	In fact , we should sell through Amazon ,
61765	0	a	do not you think ?
61766	0	a	Or eBay , yeah .
61767	0	a	Yes .
61768	1	a	Or eBay , or
61769	0	a	Yes .
61770	0	a	Yeah .
61771	0	a	There is an idea .
61772	0	a	Going with
61773	0	a	, we we are do you know , selling a unique product .
61774	0	a	Yeah , that is a good idea .
61775	0	a	To impro more profit and
61776	0	a	Yeah , yes .
61777	0	a	Well .
61778	0	a	That actually makes more sense if we are going to make it so highly customisable , cause on the web people can look at the different options they have , see maybe what other people have done , what the range of possibility as , whereas if you are in a store , you ca not unless you are a highly imaginative person , you may not really know what it is you want , whereas on the web , if you have a bunch of pictures , it can sort of trigger ideas and
61779	0	a	Yeah .
61780	0	a	There are several companies that have gone that way .
61781	1	a	And you can even have an a movie that you can rotate the object and look at the di
61782	0	a	the only thing that you are missing really is the weight .
61783	0	a	The weight and feel .
61784	0	a	Weight , the feel of the product , but There are several that have gone through with the watches , too .
61785	0	a	Yeah .
61786	0	a	We are getting used to that .
61787	0	a	It is not quite like trying on a shoe , but people are getting used to buying things online that they ca not touch before buying .
61788	0	a	Yeah .
61789	0	a	Yeah .
61790	0	a	You can customise a watch , you can see how it is at the f at the end of the production , you can change it
61791	0	a	There is a lot of online that is that is doing this now .
61792	0	a	Uh huh .
61793	0	a	Yes .
61794	0	a	And when you are rotating , you will look behind and look this way
61795	1	a	it is possible to do with this ,
61796	0	a	maybe there is a possibility of selling more than two million units in one year , which could you know , feasibili feasibility lower the price of the unit .
61797	0	a	Yeah .
61798	0	a	We can .
61799	0	a	Great .
61800	0	a	I do not think that is not possible ,
61801	0	a	it is
61802	1	a	okay then , l let is wait for the production , okay , then you can evaluate the product ,
61803	0	a	so how it looks like technically and how it look like the real .
61804	0	a	What turnaround time do we have ?
61805	0	a	Cause I mean production evaluation can be very very quick or very very long .
61806	0	a	T Oh
61807	0	a	but
61808	0	a	Yes it is it is very quick , of course .
61809	0	a	It will come back in two weeks , okay , it will be ready in two weeks .
61810	0	a	Works for me .
61811	0	a	For evaluation , okay .
61812	0	a	Prototypes , you mean .
61813	0	a	Yes , the prototype prototype product evaluation .
61814	0	a	In
61815	1	a	We probably should do some market tests once we have the prototypes and do some orders and things like that and test market it .
61816	0	a	Yes .
61817	0	a	Well , obviously .
61818	0	a	Yes .
61819	0	a	Yeah .
61820	0	a	Yes .
61821	1	a	that would have to be thrown out on the market for people to get an idea ,
61822	0	a	to see get get their
61823	0	a	I think we pretty much covered everything .
61824	0	a	Yeah .
61825	0	a	So you can take a minimum two weeks to a maximum four weeks .
61826	0	a	Think minimum two weeks if we are going to develop prototypes and then try to take them to different places and see how people use it is not a trivial task .
61827	0	a	Yeah .
61828	0	a	Yeah , because we we are not going to do it in our factory , okay , so we can give it a product evalua
61829	0	a	Yes , yes .
61830	0	a	No no .
61831	0	a	We definitely should not do it in our factory .
61832	0	a	So we will do it in the other place , and I do not think it is take more than four weeks time .
61833	0	a	Or
61834	0	a	Okay , so then the real production we will start once we product evaluation , okay , then it is approve from the technical team and your team , okay , from the management , then we can launch in the market .
61835	0	a	Hm ?
61836	1	a	S
61837	1	a	Any any other questions or comments to be discuss ?
61838	0	a	Okay ,
61839	0	a	so then
61840	1	a	Okay , let is take like this .
61841	1	a	Any outstanding ?
61842	0	a	No , I am
61843	0	a	go ahead .
61844	0	a	What ab
61845	0	a	Well I was just wondering about if we are going to do a product evaluation then what about time for redesign if the users come back and tell us no this is bad , this is bad , we want this done differently .
61846	1	a	Did you have something ?
61847	0	a	Second generation .
61848	1	a	Let is proceed with this model , okay , for the for the marketing direction , okay .
61849	0	a	So no more changes will be made , okay , in this the basic design .
61850	0	a	Okay ?
61851	0	a	So we will introduce m this model and let is introduce in the market and let is take the feedback from the customers , then we can go for the second generation .
61852	0	a	Okay .
61853	0	a	There is no end , there is not limit .
61854	0	a	The problem is there might not be a second generation if the first generation flops for some silly reason that we have not thought of .
61855	0	a	Every every custom
61856	0	a	Okay .
61857	0	a	Well , then it may not be .
61858	0	a	Well , every customer , okay , they have their own ideas , they have their own test ,
61859	0	a	okay , so there is no end , there is no limit .
61860	1	a	Like people do not like wood .
61861	0	a	No , but there is a difference between releasing a product that has been minimally tested and fine tuned to suit a general range of requirements versus releasing a product that we think will work
61862	0	a	but we do not really have anything to back it up .
61863	0	a	very specific .
61864	0	a	Yeah , so that is the reason you are here for the design , okay ,
61865	0	a	I hope you made a good design .
61866	0	a	Yes , but I am not everybody .
61867	0	a	I mean the whole point of user evaluation is to see what real people need .
61868	0	a	We have our own motivations in mind , we have our own ideas in mind , but that does not mean that that is what is going to sell .
61869	0	a	Yeah , but see , we ought to take a few considerations , okay , one is the price consideration , one is future consideration ,
61870	0	a	okay ,
61871	0	a	like you can eat you can all eat more chi
61872	0	a	I can eat more chilli , okay ,
61873	0	a	so i it is a depends on the individual taste , you know ,
61874	0	a	so we have we have to balance somewhere .
61875	0	a	Yeah , of course .
61876	0	a	I am just trying to point out that I think that your evaluation and redesign turnaround time is too short well
61877	0	a	you have no redesign
61878	0	a	not you personally ,
61879	0	a	but in the project we have no redesign time and
61880	0	a	Yeah .
61881	0	a	Yes .
61882	0	a	Our project does not
61883	0	a	Ed , d do you know what season of the year or time of the year is the most important for TV remote control sales ?
61884	1	a	Would it be the Christmas season by any chance ?
61885	0	a	Sports season .
61886	0	a	Yeah .
61887	0	a	The sports time .
61888	0	a	Right before the Eur the World Cup .
61889	0	a	Which sport season ?
61890	0	a	So so maybe what
61891	1	a	So I think what we need to do is perhaps to synchronise the final the the launch of a user tested device with some special event .
61892	0	a	Football .
61893	0	a	World soccer .
61894	0	a	World Cup soccer , they need those things that they have their hands g occupied and they need to be able to talk to the con remote control .
61895	0	a	Football .
61896	0	a	Yes .
61897	0	a	Yes .
61898	0	a	Yeah , that is a good idea .
61899	0	a	And and then
61900	0	a	so that gives us a little more time perhaps then we anticipated , because I do not know when the World Cup is , but I am sure there is going to be one .
61901	1	a	Or any major sports .
61902	0	a	Or another m major sports event .
61903	1	a	Probably not the the football games coming up the end of January .
61904	0	a	I think that might be a little too aggressive ,
61905	1	a	but , so , I am just ig pointing out a a strategy to do some additional user testing pri and then to launch at a a major sports event
61906	0	a	or perhaps to also
61907	1	a	And to work with motion pictures .
61908	0	a	Yes .
61909	0	a	Yeah .
61910	1	a	Research .
61911	0	a	Yep .
61912	0	a	That is actually good place to advertise it too .
61913	0	a	Yeah .
61914	0	a	There might be some motion pictures that are coming out that are coming out on DVD that they need to have a m special remote control to work with it ,
61915	1	a	so we could maybe work out a campaign with with Sony Pictures for example .
61916	0	a	Yes .
61917	1	a	Maybe some management has got relationships there we can leverage .
61918	1	a	Yes , the that of course I will convince the management to do that , okay .
61919	0	a	That is great .
61920	0	a	It is just something to to keep in mind , cause it is really really important .
61921	0	a	Sure , sure , yes .
61922	0	a	A lot of products have gone out there without being properly user tested and completely flopped , when in fact it gets re released a few years down the line with proper testing and it takes off like crazy .
61923	0	a	Disposable diapers is an example of that in fact .
61924	0	a	Really ?
61925	0	a	That I did not know .
61926	0	a	Yes , it is one of the first consumer products that was launched about thirty years that was a disposable consumer product ,
61927	0	a	and people
61928	0	a	the market had not really gotten on to the concept that you could use something and then throw it away , cause it was not
61929	0	a	but then when they re launched them thirty years later , they were virtually the same design , but people had gotten the throw away , you know , paper cups and napki y all kinds of things that they had not
61930	0	a	so , you are right , timing is very important , but I think we have got a good product .
61931	0	a	Yeah .
61932	0	a	Yeah .
61933	0	a	Yeah .
61934	0	a	That is the reason Ed is here .
61935	1	a	I think he can promote the the brand value and the product value .
61936	0	a	That is right .
61937	0	a	It is going to be very important to the company .
61938	0	a	Yes .
61939	0	a	We are behind the scene and he is the front screen , so .
61940	0	a	Yep .
61941	1	a	Yeah , I am the one who takes the heat .
61942	0	a	He is on the big screen .
61943	0	a	Exactly .
61944	0	a	Good luck , Ed .
61945	0	a	If it is a flop , it is the marketer .
61946	0	a	You look very relaxed , considering h you know , the the weight on your shoulders , yeah .
61947	0	a	Yes .
61948	0	a	Yes .
61949	0	a	Stress .
61950	1	a	Okay , so then let is come to the closing
61951	0	a	and are the costs within the budget and is the product evaluated , okay , so that will come soon .
61952	0	a	Celebration .
61953	0	a	Okay for but our time being , so thanks for all your efforts and great work and great design
61954	1	a	and let is leave it to the Ed for later for once production is over and the meantime let is celebrate .
61955	0	a	So let is meet up this evening to hang up for some party .
61956	0	a	Sounds good .
61957	0	a	Is good .
61958	0	a	Okay .
61959	0	a	Thank you .
61960	0	a	Very good .
61961	0	a	Thank you very much .
61962	0	a	Thank you .
61963	0	a	Thank you again for all .
61964	0	a	Bye bye .
61965	0	a	 
61966	0	a	Okay .
61967	0	a	Okay .
61968	0	a	Everybody ready ?
61969	1	a	I think the first thing we do is introduce ourselves and everybody is name and what your function is ?
61970	1	a	So maybe we start with you ?
61971	0	a	Yeah .
61972	0	a	I think so .
61973	0	a	Yeah , that is a good plan .
61974	1	a	Okay .
61975	0	a	Yeah , my name is Francina .
61976	0	a	And I am an user interface
61977	0	a	my role is
61978	0	a	the main responsibility is user interface .
61979	0	a	And my role is to design a television remote control .
61980	0	a	Okay .
61981	0	a	And I am a marketing person .
61982	0	a	I want to figure out how to sell them .
61983	0	a	And your name is ?
61984	0	a	Okay .
61985	0	a	My name is Eileen .
61986	0	a	Yeah .
61987	0	a	I am Jeanne Oui .
61988	0	a	my role is industrial designer and my responsibilities are deal with the technical functional designs and specifications of user interface and dealing with user interface design .
61989	0	a	Very good .
61990	0	a	And as you already know I am Betty .
61991	0	a	I am the project manager for today .
61992	1	a	So why do not we look at the presentation to see what we really are supposed to do .
61993	0	a	Okay .
61994	0	a	Yes y opening , acquaintance , tool training
61995	0	a	well , the tools are , I think , we already
61996	0	a	I guess the tool is really our the computer , as far as I can see .
61997	0	a	we get ins each of us will get instructions
61998	1	a	and we will take it from there .
61999	0	a	Project plan , that falls under the same heading pretty much .
62000	0	a	, I do not think we have any great discussion at this point .
62001	0	a	No .
62002	0	a	Here is what this thing should be .
62003	0	a	This thing we are going to design is a new remote control .
62004	0	a	should be original , trendy , and , of course , user friendly .
62005	1	a	So maybe you want to make some notes of that .
62006	0	a	Okay .
62007	0	a	Okay ?
62008	0	a	All right .
62009	0	a	Here is what the functional design is supposed to achieve .
62010	0	a	That is it is going to be individual work and then at the meeting we will discuss what we have come up with .
62011	0	a	The same goes for the conceptual design , there will be individual work whic and then discussion afterwards .
62012	0	a	Detailed design , same thing basically .
62013	0	a	kay so
62014	0	a	Three different types of design that we are going to be concerned with
62015	0	a	okay .
62016	0	a	Functional , conception and detailed .
62017	0	a	I ca not write with this thing .
62018	0	a	Maybe we should redesign it .
62019	0	a	Yes .
62020	0	a	After we have finished the remote control we will get to that .
62021	0	a	Yeah , okay .
62022	0	a	All right ?
62023	0	a	Then , tool training try out the white board , participant can draw their favourite animal .
62024	1	a	Does anybody want to go and see how the white board works ?
62025	0	a	So that in case we have to , in the next meeting , present something on the white board .
62026	1	a	You want to go Eileen and
62027	0	a	Whether you without hanging yourself .
62028	1	a	Okay , I will see what I can do .
62029	0	a	See if I r
62030	1	a	See if I remember how to draw a kitty cat or a rabbit or something .
62031	0	a	And remember you have to press so it works .
62032	0	a	So that it will record okay .
62033	0	a	traditional kitty cat .
62034	0	a	Fat , a fat cat .
62035	0	a	I have a very fat cat .
62036	0	a	And it likes to sit like that .
62037	0	a	Okay .
62038	0	a	Okay .
62039	0	a	And you are Francine , right ?
62040	1	a	Would you like s like just to see how it feels , so that you have a little idea ?
62041	0	a	In
62042	0	a	No , no .
62043	0	a	Yes , I am Francina .
62044	1	a	Yes , sure .
62045	0	a	Am I supposed to wipe off that or
62046	0	a	okay .
62047	0	a	No , that is okay .
62048	0	a	No , Okay .
62049	0	a	I do not know ,
62050	1	a	we will get to that later .
62051	0	a	Okay .
62052	1	a	What should I draw ?
62053	1	a	I am going to draw a snake .
62054	0	a	Snake .
62055	0	a	How does it look like ?
62056	0	a	Yes .
62057	0	a	, okay .
62058	0	a	Okay .
62059	0	a	Okay .
62060	0	a	I hope the kitty cat is hungry cause I do not like snakes .
62061	0	a	Here is the project finance which , of course , we all have to think about when we design this thing .
62062	0	a	selling price is supposed to be twenty five Euro .
62063	0	a	profit aim for the company is fifty million Euro , the market range unlimited meaning international and the production cost should not exceed hopefully should be less than twelve fifty Euro .
62064	0	a	Okay .
62065	0	a	kay that should keep everybody on their toes and challenged .
62066	0	a	Profit .
62067	0	a	is fifty .
62068	0	a	So these are all things , of course , to remember with the budget and when you design to materials , cost , etcetera .
62069	0	a	Now , the discussion I guess is does anyone of you have experience with remote control ?
62070	0	a	I exp I s cause we we use them we use them , right , everyday .
62071	0	a	Oops .
62072	0	a	Yeah , of course , using remote control .
62073	0	a	Yeah .
62074	0	a	And
62075	1	a	now having used a remote control for years does anybody already have like an idea like things you did not like with it , things you would like to change , things you would like to improve with this thing any first ideas ?
62076	1	a	Would you like it to be smaller , bigger , have more have more buttons on it or maybe clearly better marked buttons
62077	1	a	, you know , things like that ?
62078	0	a	Small , right .
62079	0	a	Yeah , I
62080	1	a	Yes , I I feel that all the remote should be very compact .
62081	0	a	Yeah .
62082	0	a	Yeah .
62083	0	a	Yeah ,
62084	0	a	those which we get here nowadays it is very long .
62085	1	a	And and it should have multi purpose .
62086	1	a	Like the remote control which we use for TV , it shou it should be used f for some other purpose also , like controlling the temperature inside the house or for air conditioners , or for heating system .
62087	1	a	Audio player .
62088	0	a	Oh .
62089	0	a	Okay .
62090	0	a	So it should be a multi functional gadget that would control all your household machines basically .
62091	0	a	Yes , exactly Yes .
62092	0	a	Yes .
62093	0	a	Divides us
62094	0	a	Yeah .
62095	0	a	Yeah .
62096	0	a	Exactly .
62097	0	a	Yeah .
62098	0	a	At twelve fifty Euros per
62099	0	a	Well who knows if we get a really good designer maybe we can do that .
62100	0	a	Well .
62101	0	a	Yeah .
62102	1	a	We certainly can try to
62103	0	a	I agree with her that to market something successfully it should do some more things .
62104	0	a	It should be something new it should be s
62105	0	a	it
62106	0	a	it should do something different than than just what we have .
62107	0	a	That is right .
62108	0	a	Yeah , of course .
62109	0	a	Now , of course , the other thing to think there is maybe the design .
62110	0	a	Yeah .
62111	1	a	Yeah , design should be , yeah it should be different .
62112	0	a	All the almost all the remotes
62113	0	a	Yes , exactly .
62114	1	a	Like trendy no like f for earlier we saw maybe it should be something trendy you know .
62115	0	a	Yeah ,
62116	0	a	maybe ten
62117	0	a	I do yeah , colours
62118	1	a	and al shapes also .
62119	1	a	Maybe it should different colours or materials or you know .
62120	0	a	Are different shapes .
62121	0	a	Yes .
62122	1	a	Yeah .
62123	1	a	so yeah
62124	1	a	shapes
62125	1	a	right , you know , like kidney shape feels better in your hand or something , you know .
62126	0	a	Yes .
62127	0	a	Yeah of course
62128	0	a	yeah .
62129	0	a	Yeah okay , friendly shape , that would help .
62130	0	a	Yeah .
62131	1	a	I think another thing that would help is if it beeps when you clap ,
62132	0	a	because I think one of the big things that happens is people lose them .
62133	0	a	Yes .
62134	0	a	They ca not find it .
62135	0	a	That is true ,
62136	0	a	because they put a newspaper or they put it behind a plant or , we you know , whatever .
62137	0	a	Yeah .
62138	0	a	And and they suddenly the phone rings
62139	0	a	and they want to turn the TV off
62140	0	a	and they say , where the hell is my my remote control
62141	0	a	yeah ?
62142	1	a	Well or yeah
62143	1	a	or if it is really , if it is really in a dark spot that it gives out a a sound or a signal .
62144	0	a	So some
62145	0	a	so , so it is really the beep or , or a light should blink .
62146	0	a	Yeah , some beep or something like that ,
62147	0	a	so that we can go
62148	0	a	Yeah .
62149	0	a	Or a b Should ha
62150	0	a	A fluorescent signal , yeah .
62151	0	a	Yeah .
62152	0	a	So if lost
62153	1	a	If lost signal with b throw signal , you know .
62154	0	a	kay .
62155	0	a	Yeah ,
62156	1	a	maybe it should have a light so that we can , we can just recognise where it is .
62157	0	a	Exactly , I mean just that is what I am saying .
62158	0	a	Yeah ,
62159	0	a	yeah .
62160	0	a	May not be beep .
62161	0	a	I am just saying throw signal meaning just whether it is a beep or whether a light or
62162	1	a	Okay , my my idea is maybe that the minute it is really hidden , in in other words if it is like in a dark spot , meaning you know like a newspaper is on top , a sweater is on top or
62163	1	a	it
62164	1	a	it is behind a plant , at that moment it is it is like
62165	1	a	, it is like , what you call it a light s sensors , you know ?
62166	1	a	In in that moment it has a sensor , i
62167	1	a	it
62168	1	a	it gets a certain darkness , it ge has a sensor and it gives out a signal whether that be a light signal or a beep , I mean , that we can discuss that later , you know .
62169	0	a	Beep or it is a light , maybe it is a light .
62170	1	a	And do you think a good c c clue for that is that it would respond to a clap or it would respond to your voice or it would respond what what should you have to do to make it beep or blink ?
62171	0	a	Okay so
62172	0	a	Okay .
62173	0	a	Yes .
62174	0	a	Yeah , probably
62175	0	a	yeah , probably it is a
62176	0	a	yeah ,
62177	0	a	yeah .
62178	0	a	Yeah .
62179	0	a	And
62180	0	a	Yes .
62181	0	a	So the light sensor would activate the signal .
62182	0	a	That is right .
62183	0	a	You know there would be
62184	0	a	right you have to have some kind of sensor
62185	0	a	and I
62186	0	a	I think voice or clapping it is not specific enough .
62187	0	a	I know there are the lamps and stuff , you know , you can clap on and off ,
62188	0	a	but I think they only work to certain degree and
62189	0	a	What with
62190	0	a	Oh yeah well ,
62191	0	a	but then those people we ca not help everybody .
62192	0	a	But it could be someplace really obvious and you still would not be able to find it .
62193	0	a	Yeah , of course ,
62194	0	a	that did not
62195	0	a	I i
62196	0	a	we ca not do it .
62197	0	a	Well , because you are s because you are silly .
62198	0	a	Then , in that case
62199	0	a	Yes .
62200	0	a	Because people are silly .
62201	0	a	I mean it could be on
62202	0	a	well , i if it were like on top of your bookcase and you usually kept it on the coffee table
62203	0	a	you know , well
62204	1	a	maybe we have to move along , okay .
62205	0	a	Okay we have
62206	0	a	yeah , we have to move along , but I think we have some good good points to start with here .
62207	0	a	Yeah , good point .
62208	0	a	Okay , the next meeting will be in thirty minutes .
62209	0	a	I think you all
62210	0	a	did you get notices on your computer for this ?
62211	0	a	Okay
62212	0	a	so well , you got the notice
62213	0	a	Me
62214	0	a	yeah .
62215	0	a	The working design , I guess that is the function
62216	0	a	ID who is this ?
62217	0	a	The industrial designer That is you .
62218	0	a	Yeah .
62219	0	a	Yeah , it is functional de
62220	0	a	yeah , exactly , technical .
62221	0	a	Okay .
62222	0	a	So , we looking for a working design when we come back .
62223	0	a	Yeah .
62224	0	a	working design ,
62225	0	a	yeah , it is it is mainly technical functional design .
62226	0	a	Then
62227	0	a	And then the technical funct you are the technical function , so so you are the working design .
62228	0	a	Yeah , functional design ,
62229	0	a	and you
62230	0	a	Yeah .
62231	0	a	So you have a working design and then a functional design .
62232	0	a	Okay .
62233	0	a	And the marketing manager is coming up with some user requirement specification , like friendliness , and what we just discussed in general .
62234	0	a	That would be your idea .
62235	0	a	And , of course , price .
62236	0	a	That it , that it , that the price is a good price .
62237	0	a	I mean , the price is given , but , that was
62238	0	a	That is right .
62239	0	a	We have to justify that price by having sufficient features to make it sell at that price .
62240	0	a	That is right .
62241	0	a	And , you know , specifi you you will get specific instructions for that .
62242	0	a	I think that is the end of the show .
62243	0	a	Yeah .
62244	0	a	So we have
62245	0	a	well , we have a twen two two two three minutes .
62246	0	a	any questions at this point ?
62247	1	a	Or suggestions ?
62248	0	a	I think basically basically you will get instructions to work with
62249	0	a	and if you have any questions , I guess , you can
62250	0	a	Okay .
62251	0	a	Okay , I think I have enough to think about until our next meeting .
62252	0	a	Yeah , even I have .
62253	0	a	How about you people ?
62254	0	a	Really ?
62255	0	a	Okay .
62256	0	a	Yeah , even I have , I think , yeah .
62257	0	a	Yes .
62258	0	a	Kay .
62259	0	a	Okay .
62260	0	a	Alright , well
62261	0	a	Yeah , so let is see .
62262	0	a	Then we see you in about thirty minutes .
62263	0	a	Yes .
62264	0	a	And see what we can come up with .
62265	0	a	Okay .
62266	0	a	 
62267	0	a	Okay , is everybody ready ?
62268	0	a	Yeah ?
62269	0	a	Open .
62270	0	a	Yeah I would to just put on my microphone here and I will be right with you .
62271	0	a	Okay ?
62272	0	a	Okay
62273	0	a	you want me to start right now ?
62274	0	a	Okay .
62275	0	a	I take it you all have received instructions as to what you were supposed to do
62276	0	a	and
62277	1	a	I think the Marketing Manager probably should go first , addressing the needs and desires .
62278	0	a	Yes .
62279	0	a	Yeah , .
62280	1	a	Well , could you put my slides up
62281	0	a	cause I think it might be helpful if we looked at the slides at the same time .
62282	1	a	Okay .
62283	0	a	You are participant four .
62284	0	a	I am participant four I believe .
62285	0	a	Yes uh huh .
62286	0	a	Kay .
62287	0	a	Okay , and now I can full screen .
62288	0	a	, okay
62289	0	a	, okay .
62290	0	a	There we go .
62291	0	a	Okay well I think we have introduced ourselves , so the functional requirements are is is part of my goal
62292	1	a	but why do not we pass right to the second slide .
62293	0	a	And then full screen .
62294	0	a	Cause that is where m my discussion starts .
62295	0	a	Right well since I am in charge of trying to figure out what we should put on this thing since I have to try to sell it .
62296	0	a	I thought that the method I should follow would be gather suggestions from everybody , and th the reason I just put that there like that is that in the init in the initial stage I think I should just be open to lots of suggestions .
62297	1	a	You know you can say anything you want no matter how silly it sounds
62298	1	a	you know it should run your car , it should heat up your motor if should turn on your CD whatever you want it to do and then as we go on what we will have to do is accept and eliminate these suggestions according to design and budget feasibility .
62299	0	a	Kay .
62300	1	a	So I will be coming to you frequently as the Industrial Expert to tell me how hard it is going to be to add a feature or how expensive it is going to be or if your time , if it takes five years to develop this it is just something we ca not do .
62301	0	a	Yeah .
62302	0	a	Yeah .
62303	0	a	Yeah .
62304	1	a	So in the beginning just have a big puddle of things that we anybody can th throw anything in and then just weed things out that ca not be done for one reason or another , and then the things that seem the most attractive that to to a customer we will try to then prioritise those .
62305	0	a	Yeah .
62306	0	a	Yeah .
62307	0	a	So that was what I meant there , and as I said on the slide there consulting the Industrial Engineer about that
62308	0	a	and the other thing is timing is really going to be as important as money , because if we are going to sell this thing , I think the best time to sell it is as a Christmas present .
62309	0	a	Twenty five Euros makes a nice little present , and we want it to be an impulse purchase , we want somebody to see it and think it is , gee
62310	0	a	I just gotta have that .
62311	0	a	And take out their wallet and buy it .
62312	1	a	So it is gotta be really attractive
62313	0	a	and it
62314	1	a	but it is gotta go to market by September ,
62315	0	a	cause anything that you do not already have out there in September showing it around , is not going to sell for Christmas .
62316	0	a	Yeah .
62317	1	a	and then I will be coming to you as the User Interface person to try to tell me from your point of view what are the most friendly features that we could put on it
62318	1	a	and try to prior help me with that prioritising of of the features and of the the look and the colour
62319	1	a	and I will be coming back to you to help weed out those suggestions from that point of view .
62320	0	a	Okay .
62321	0	a	Okay .
62322	1	a	So I will be coming to you for how much is it going to cost us and how long is it going to take you , and I will be coming to you to tell me what is going to make somebody take out their wallet you know ,
62323	0	a	what what is what is going to really be what they call a sizzle , cause we gotta sell this sizzle .
62324	0	a	What features .
62325	0	a	S sellable .
62326	0	a	Yes .
62327	0	a	A lot of times the thing that works the best from an engineering point of view is not the thing that somebody is really just going to take out their wallet and buy for Christmas for for their child or for their husband or whatever .
62328	0	a	Yes .
62329	1	a	Okay can we go to the next slide please ?
62330	0	a	Alright
62331	0	a	I
62332	0	a	I already did a little bit of research after our first meeting where we threw out some ideas and it looks to me that within the budget that we are looking at the the whole house idea really is not going to be possible .
62333	1	a	So I would like your suggestions to come back to the other slide where I was saying we we could suggest anything .
62334	1	a	I would like the suggestions to be really specific , so that we will have a list of things we can cross off , not something like you know whole house control
62335	0	a	what will be
62336	0	a	And then I found on the internet from from my research that some extended electronic entertainment control should be possible .
62337	0	a	At the budget that we are looking at and at the price point we are looking at , we should be able to make it work the TV , the VCR ,
62338	0	a	the stereo set maybe something else cute like a coffee pot or one other appliance or maybe a lamp .
62339	1	a	okay , can can I at this point interject something ?
62340	0	a	we have received instruction from higher up that certain things should not be considered .
62341	0	a	I have to wind up ?
62342	0	a	Yeah , sure .
62343	0	a	Okay .
62344	0	a	the one thing for example something to eliminate maybe that is the teletext , because that is sort of outdated with the internet , and according to to higher management the it should only control the TV , mostly because they feel that it is too comp complex a task to to to include other things , and they are concerned with the time to market .
62345	0	a	Okay .
62346	0	a	Complicated , yeah , of course .
62347	0	a	Yeah .
62348	0	a	Of course , yeah .
62349	0	a	Okay .
62350	0	a	Okay .
62351	0	a	and the
62352	0	a	and the third thing that they want to make sure that their that the corporate image is being maintained , and that the corporate colour and design are being used on the product , so that it is easy that that that they can be easily identified as a product of of of the company , and that there is no mistake that it could be somebody else who is bringing this out .
62353	0	a	Okay , so that is something
62354	0	a	Okay
62355	0	a	so
62356	0	a	Okay .
62357	0	a	So I just wanted to interject this here
62358	0	a	so we are not getting too much off track here with with the things we want to look at .
62359	0	a	These were instructions from higher up so we have to eliminate these things , so it is only going to be TV , but the one thing maybe that could be eliminated is the teletext idea .
62360	0	a	kay .
62361	0	a	Okay .
62362	0	a	Alright ,
62363	0	a	thanks for that .
62364	0	a	alright now other things that I found out on in my research is that the complaints that people have about the remote controls that are out there now .
62365	0	a	Cause a lot of them take too much time to learn how to use , and that was thirty four percent but even more important the thing that we did address in our last meeting that frequently it is lost somewhere in the room .
62366	1	a	so those are two things that we definitely do want to address , we want to s make it as simple as possible , we want to make it obvious and intuitive to use ,
62367	0	a	and then the things about finding it we talked about the a light emitting thing as well as maybe a beep ,
62368	1	a	and I think that those are things after my research that we definitely want to try to incorporate .
62369	1	a	Kay can we go to the next slide please ?
62370	1	a	Okay , so , my personal preferences in this project are really have to concentrate on the sizzle .
62371	0	a	That is the selling point , the thing that is going to make it an impulse purchase .
62372	0	a	because once there is no be back , well in sales they always say you know , be backs do not come back .
62373	0	a	If somebody says , oh I will come back and get it next week you are dead .
62374	0	a	They are never going to come back and buy it .
62375	0	a	You have gotta make it attractive enough so they buy it now now now
62376	0	a	w now is a big word in in my book for selling this thing .
62377	1	a	And , in order to make it really sellable we have gotta shorten the learning curve , make sure it is really intuitive and easy to use .
62378	1	a	We have to have as few buttons as possible ,
62379	0	a	because more buttons is more confusion ,
62380	0	a	so that is why I am saying , simplicity is good .
62381	0	a	Finding it is important , obviously you ca not use it if you ca not find it .
62382	1	a	So we have gotta concentrate on the features that help you find it ,
62383	0	a	and I have already said this several times
62384	0	a	but I put it down in writing here
62385	0	a	, it should be an attractive impulse purchase at twenty five Euros .
62386	0	a	So it has to have enough value that when somebody looks at it they say , twenty five Euros I am not going to take that .
62387	0	a	Has to be so great that they are going to say , twenty five Euros is not much .
62388	1	a	and then maybe a motto , like we put fashion in electronics might be something we can use in our marketing campaign .
62389	0	a	Yeah .
62390	0	a	Okay that is about it for me right now .
62391	0	a	Okay .
62392	0	a	And
62393	0	a	who would be next , ,
62394	0	a	I guess that would be you .
62395	1	a	Yeah kay .
62396	1	a	You want me to get your slide show up ?
62397	0	a	Yeah
62398	0	a	yeah sure .
62399	0	a	Thank you .
62400	0	a	And you are number three ?
62401	0	a	Number two .
62402	0	a	Number two ,
62403	0	a	yeah .
62404	0	a	Yeah exactly .
62405	0	a	Okay .
62406	1	a	can you make it full screen please ?
62407	0	a	No ,
62408	0	a	it is like a
62409	0	a	well you you have to press here .
62410	1	a	Okay .
62411	0	a	Yep .
62412	0	a	The cup cup shape here ?
62413	0	a	The thir third .
62414	0	a	Yeah yeah , uh huh .
62415	0	a	Yeah exactly .
62416	0	a	There , .
62417	0	a	so today I am going to talk about the working design of the remote controller .
62418	0	a	Okay .
62419	1	a	can you go to the next sli slide please ?
62420	0	a	The metal is like
62421	0	a	in a remote controller you have a chip integrated circuit which is like a brain of the remote controller .
62422	0	a	It takes the power from a battery say a battery it it can be a elec an electric supply like you have to like switch connec connect connect your remote controller to power supply from the you know electricity or something like that .
62423	0	a	It should be a battery because remote controller should be like you you
62424	0	a	you should take it t to wherever you want
62425	0	a	and then th
62426	0	a	this integrated circuitry takes energy from the power source and whatever like if you press a button it is like a input for the remote controller and it takes the input and
62427	0	a	it it transforms into a infro infrared bits and it sends it into the device , like a TV or a air conditioner , something like that so .
62428	0	a	a remote controller is specifically designed to a single device .
62429	0	a	If you want to design it for multiple devices then you should make all the devices compatible with the frequency like th the remote controller it sends some bits
62430	0	a	some waves like with a particular frequency the device should know what the frequency is .
62431	0	a	It should re re recognise the waves which are coming from the remote controller and it should take the action like if you press a button channel or something like that then the remote remote controller will send a send a se send a signal , and the TV it should translate that into like change the channel or something like that , change the volume control
62432	0	a	and so I think it is hard to design a remote controller for multiple devices .
62433	0	a	Signal .
62434	0	a	Receive .
62435	0	a	Multi purpose .
62436	0	a	Yeah well that is already been eliminated by management , so we are off the hook .
62437	0	a	Yo and it is
62438	0	a	yeah
62439	0	a	but it is so .
62440	0	a	yeah .
62441	0	a	Yep .
62442	0	a	So user interface controls the chip and accordingly the messages like there should be a user user in interface like you know switch pad or something like that buttons should be there .
62443	0	a	So you can control whatever you want , you want to change the channel you want to control the volume you you want to mute mute the TV
62444	0	a	or you want to have a child lock
62445	0	a	or you want to do some operations
62446	0	a	there is a there should be some device to tell what to do to the in integrated circuit so that the integrated circuit can s send the signals and TV can perform the actions .
62447	0	a	okay .
62448	1	a	So can you go to the next slide please ?
62449	1	a	So I I just would like to add some extra features to the remote controller
62450	0	a	I think these are the very simple features and they do not take much much of the investment also ,
62451	1	a	it is like el the text or buttons which which are there on the remote controller
62452	1	a	they those we can make like fluorescent
62453	0	a	they will be like light emitting if it is dark so that you can find your remote controller if it is dark .
62454	0	a	Okay .
62455	1	a	And ther there should be a beep if many buttons are pressed
62456	0	a	if suppose a child is playing with the remote controller and a
62457	0	a	and she she or he is pressing the buttons all at the time
62458	0	a	then there should be a beep saying that it is this this is not a a you know a a action , there can be no action taking to that so .
62459	1	a	And there should be a child lock ,
62460	0	a	like you should be able to lock your remote controller so that whatever buttons are pressed by a child they ca not be like y
62461	0	a	you
62462	0	a	i
62463	0	a	you if you have ki kids and all then they will be pl playing with the remote controllers so can lock the remote controller .
62464	0	a	If make it useable for more than one device it is a it is hard
62465	0	a	but I think it is possible
62466	0	a	but it
62467	0	a	yeah
62468	0	a	yeah
62469	0	a	yeah
62470	0	a	so it is it is
62471	0	a	okay ,
62472	0	a	yeah ,
62473	0	a	yeah .
62474	0	a	Yeah well
62475	0	a	yeah
62476	0	a	well that has been e that has been eliminated ,
62477	0	a	so that is that is unfortunately a moot point now .
62478	0	a	Well we already eliminated that .
62479	0	a	Eliminated .
62480	1	a	And different shapes that we can do like we can have you know a all animals shapes
62481	1	a	or you know comfortable whi which can fit into your hands
62482	0	a	and so that
62483	0	a	Yeah ,
62484	0	a	yeah ,
62485	0	a	yeah
62486	1	a	and colours also , different colours , and
62487	0	a	No no
62488	0	a	no , it wo not I do not think it will be like ,
62489	0	a	you can have you know for if you want ther there to be more
62490	0	a	Yeah yeah .
62491	0	a	Now that is good from a marketing point of view , the fun the fun shape .
62492	0	a	Yeah I
62493	0	a	It just build a mould basically and you know .
62494	0	a	And that
62495	0	a	you you say that wo not add too much to the budget ?
62496	0	a	To d the shape is
62497	0	a	Do you think there is any chance of having ser in having basically the same machine with the same buttons but maybe several different shapes ?
62498	0	a	Is that going to be a possible ?
62499	0	a	Cause that might help with the marketing .
62500	0	a	colours .
62501	0	a	It is it is just a s shape so it does not matter .
62502	0	a	Yes exactly .
62503	0	a	As the budget we are looking at if you build one mould
62504	0	a	I do not think that is going to make a big difference whether it is going to be square or
62505	0	a	Oh yes .
62506	0	a	Yeah .
62507	0	a	Yeah that is also possible
62508	0	a	I
62509	0	a	yeah
62510	0	a	I
62511	0	a	I
62512	0	a	yeah .
62513	0	a	Yes .
62514	0	a	I think
62515	1	a	I think we will have to look at the budget on that
62516	0	a	but I think in principle that that would be that would be kind of fun , you know .
62517	0	a	Yeah that will be
62518	0	a	Yeah yeah .
62519	1	a	Because we had something sort of sexy for adults and we could have something sort of
62520	0	a	silly for children
62521	1	a	or a little animal shape or in a or a little elephant so they can remember where it is .
62522	0	a	Yeah .
62523	1	a	Silly for children .
62524	0	a	Yeah , for children , yeah exactly .
62525	1	a	Like an animal or
62526	0	a	Yeah .
62527	1	a	Like a doll , or
62528	0	a	Yes .
62529	0	a	Yeah , that is what , yeah .
62530	0	a	Yeah , exactly .
62531	0	a	Yeah .
62532	1	a	And and the butto buttons also I think if you want to have more features in your remote controller then there should be more buttons .
62533	0	a	If there are more buttons then it will be more complicated .
62534	0	a	If you have less features then your remote controller wo not be attractive ,
62535	1	a	so I think we need to make some buttons which are which are like f in in intended for two or three operations ,
62536	0	a	like if you press one button in one mode then it will change the channel , if you press the other button in another mode it will change the colour .
62537	0	a	So if you want to have less buttons we can have that option
62538	0	a	but I think it will complicate the matter more
62539	0	a	I think so .
62540	1	a	Well , I think I think that that is something that we will have to discuss with the User Interface person
62541	0	a	because I think there is a lot of argument to be made for one button for one feature .
62542	0	a	Yep
62543	0	a	, yeah .
62544	0	a	Yes .
62545	0	a	Because I think one of the things were complaining about in my what I found out in my research is when they complained about how hard it is to learn a new one .
62546	0	a	The changing modes was something I mean you and I ,
62547	0	a	all f all four of us we work with computers all the time ,
62548	0	a	changing modes is nothing for us ,
62549	0	a	but people who
62550	0	a	N and
62551	0	a	And that is and that is the kind of thing people learn by feel ,
62552	0	a	and you do not feel the mode change .
62553	0	a	Yeah , it is like you know
62554	0	a	yeah .
62555	0	a	Yeah .
62556	0	a	Yeah ,
62557	0	a	yeah .
62558	0	a	Okay .
62559	0	a	Yeah , a little elderly , a little arthritic hand you know , and
62560	0	a	and it is a small button and
62561	0	a	and it they do not press it
62562	0	a	exactly you know something else happens n not their favourite channel comes up but
62563	0	a	something else and they are very frustrated you know .
62564	0	a	Yeah .
62565	0	a	Yeah , yes .
62566	0	a	Something else .
62567	0	a	Yeah ,
62568	0	a	yeah
62569	0	a	you do not us
62570	0	a	yeah
62571	0	a	yeah , usually .
62572	0	a	Yeah .
62573	1	a	So maybe having buttons be various shapes might be a help too .
62574	0	a	Yeah shapes also , different shapes .
62575	1	a	You know , like the a triangle is for the volume and a square is for changing channels , so that people can develop a tactile sense of it .
62576	0	a	Yeah
62577	0	a	that will
62578	0	a	Channels .
62579	0	a	Yeah .
62580	0	a	Yeah .
62581	1	a	But we will get to that with you .
62582	0	a	Yeah , yeah ,
62583	1	a	and also text should be very clear so that there there wo not be any ambiguities and
62584	0	a	So yeah .
62585	0	a	Yes .
62586	0	a	That is right , yeah .
62587	0	a	Now that is a good point .
62588	0	a	Yes .
62589	0	a	Yeah .
62590	1	a	And display clock i if you want more features then we can display a clock
62591	0	a	it I
62592	0	a	I do not think it will take any money extra money because anyway we have an integrated circuit I think we can just definitely fit that feature into the circuit so it is
62593	0	a	Yeah ,
62594	0	a	and we display a clock .
62595	0	a	Yeah , that is that is a good that is a good one , because the clock would be really friendly ,
62596	0	a	and and when is your favourite show coming on
62597	0	a	and
62598	0	a	Yeah , and a lot of time there is not a clock on the screen , and you have to go somewhere
62599	0	a	but you just want to look at the news for a minute .
62600	0	a	yeah .
62601	0	a	Yes .
62602	0	a	Yeah .
62603	0	a	Yes .
62604	0	a	Yeah , and then you can just see your remote controller
62605	0	a	yeah
62606	0	a	yeah
62607	0	a	yeah
62608	0	a	so
62609	0	a	Yeah .
62610	0	a	Yes .
62611	0	a	Yeah you are sitting there already or maybe you have no other
62612	0	a	Yeah that is that is good , the clock is good .
62613	0	a	Yeah .
62614	0	a	Okay .
62615	1	a	can you go to the next slide please ?
62616	0	a	components the main components we need for it ha like buttons and underneath that there should be switch .
62617	0	a	And bulbs .
62618	0	a	Like we can have a bulb like whenever we are operating a remote controller or whenever the TV is on suppose , then the remote controller should automatically have a b s light .
62619	0	a	Then it will be like if you switch on your TV through anoth another source , not from through a remote remote controller
62620	0	a	and you you lost your remote controller
62621	0	a	maybe you can find with the light .
62622	1	a	Maybe we can have that .
62623	1	a	Whenever the TV is on , remote controller will have a light .
62624	0	a	And then infrared bulbs .
62625	0	a	this is like when it is dark .
62626	0	a	Yeah , .
62627	0	a	And battery , there should be a battery for power supply , and a chip , chip which is like a brain to the remote controller which does all the operations , and wires connecting all chips , which is lights , everything , so there should be wires .
62628	0	a	Yeah .
62629	0	a	Okay .
62630	0	a	And of course there should be a case where we can keep all the things and , you know different shapes or whatever it is there should be a case to put to give a shape .
62631	0	a	To keep the remote ?
62632	0	a	Yeah .
62633	0	a	Yeah .
62634	0	a	Case .
62635	0	a	A case holder .
62636	0	a	Yeah , holder .
62637	0	a	A holder remote holder .
62638	0	a	Holder , yeah , .
62639	1	a	can you move onto the next slide .
62640	1	a	next sli slide please .
62641	0	a	I have referred the site the homepage of the our website , from where I have I got s few points .
62642	0	a	That is it , that is it from me now .
62643	0	a	Okay .
62644	1	a	So it we should visit this site and have a look at what is up there ?
62645	1	a	Or
62646	0	a	Okay .
62647	1	a	Well , you do not have to .
62648	0	a	it is not like that , I have referred the page to get new ideas or like what can be the working design to how it works and all and so and so .
62649	0	a	Okay .
62650	0	a	So it might be helpful if we had a look at that .
62651	0	a	Yeah if you want .
62652	0	a	Okay ,
62653	0	a	thank you .
62654	0	a	Yeah , it is okay .
62655	1	a	Could you go back to that slide where she had that s slide up Betsy ?
62656	0	a	Yeah , okay ,
62657	0	a	thank you .
62658	0	a	, it is actually there now , there on the screen .
62659	0	a	This one ?
62660	0	a	And Francine ?
62661	0	a	You are number two ?
62662	0	a	You are three .
62663	0	a	Participant two .
62664	0	a	Yes .
62665	0	a	No no , I am three .
62666	1	a	I can make it full ?
62667	0	a	Yes yes yes .
62668	0	a	Would you want it full full screen ?
62669	0	a	Okay .
62670	0	a	Okay .
62671	0	a	As User Interface Designer I did a little research to find out what are the features which a user would like to have on their remote .
62672	1	a	Yeah can you please go onto the next slide ?
62673	0	a	So I found out that but the main purpose of a remote is to f control the function of a television at a far off distance at remote distance .
62674	0	a	Now for that , a remote controller should have a switch on off button by which a user can sit anywhere in the room in front of the TV and he can control the functionalities different functionalities of the TV .
62675	0	a	There should be a signal something like a radio wave or a infrared light or a LED which can be used to change the different functionalities in the television if the user wants to change the channels or increase the volume he can change it .
62676	0	a	Now there should be some timer to set for viewing a particular a particular programme or switching on and off a a particular programme according to the user choice .
62677	0	a	On the on on the remote .
62678	0	a	Yes .
62679	0	a	Yeah , .
62680	0	a	Yes .
62681	0	a	So if if he want to view a particular programme at say nine o'clock he can set the time , and the TV will automatically it will switch on at that particular time .
62682	0	a	Right .
62683	0	a	So he can use that kind of properties of features and then there should be a child lock system if a particular channel is not to be viewed by a particular for a certain age , then the parents can lock that particular channel so that the ch children cannot view that channel .
62684	0	a	Yes .
62685	0	a	By your child , .
62686	0	a	And the the and the
62687	0	a	one of the feature a user would like to have is the compactness of the co remote .
62688	0	a	t the remote should be compact and it should ha it should have as many buttons as possible for controlling different functionalities of the TV television .
62689	1	a	And as this is my personal preference that it should be in the shape of a T in alphabet for more compactability .
62690	0	a	And and
62691	0	a	and it is one more point which I noted it down , like the material which which which is used for remotes should be human friendly it should not cause any skin disease or something some al allergy to either children or to ad adult person .
62692	0	a	, kay .
62693	1	a	And it should have an it can have an alarm clock
62694	0	a	a a person if some if somebody wants to get up at around eight eight PM then he can set the time and it can be used as an alarm clock , and I do not think it will cost much to set an alarm clock inside a remote .
62695	0	a	Yeah , sure .
62696	0	a	If there is a clock then there can be a alarm clock .
62697	0	a	And an alarm clock , yeah
62698	0	a	that should that should be okay .
62699	0	a	Yes ,
62700	1	a	and as John Reece said the buttons can be , can me we can use the fluorescence to light up the buttons so different buttons will glow differently .
62701	0	a	So in even in the dark the user can know what buttons to use to switch on a particular channel .
62702	1	a	And the design of the remote should be in such a way that there should not be any sharp projections
62703	0	a	so that if a child plays with a remote , he he should not be harmed in any way .
62704	0	a	And findings , I found out y on different sites that there are different remotes which can be used , there are remotes which use the infrared for controlling the different functionalities , there are remotes which use the radio waves to control the functions
62705	0	a	and there are
62706	0	a	So there you have different types of remotes for different light source which are used which can be used for controlling the different functionalities of a television .
62707	1	a	Next slide .
62708	0	a	And these are my few personal preferences
62709	1	a	like it can be used for a multipurpose use .
62710	0	a	Not , no
62711	1	a	like it can it can be used as a TV control as plus an alarm clock to set an alarm a timing and it should have a child lock , and then to save electricity
62712	1	a	there should not be much s move lots of circuits and all that .
62713	1	a	And if a person if if if parents wants the television to be switched off by ten o'clock then it should be switched off ten o at ten o'clock automatically , so that nobody else comes later and use it .
62714	0	a	It is like a t
62715	0	a	okay , it is like a timer it is like a lock to the television .
62716	0	a	Timer , yeah , , .
62717	0	a	Timer .
62718	0	a	Yeah and then you can use a timer as well .
62719	0	a	Yes .
62720	0	a	Yeah that is it .
62721	0	a	okay ,
62722	0	a	now I have
62723	0	a	On my slide show basically we already we have already done the agenda , and on the closing basically there will be lunch break and all that .
62724	0	a	However the decision we have to take in this meeting is who is our target group .
62725	0	a	Okay .
62726	0	a	And what function , working design , how how does it work .
62727	0	a	So these are the two things we should come up wit with .
62728	0	a	So the first thing is pro maybe a little easier on who is our target group .
62729	0	a	I guess in many ways everybody .
62730	0	a	Everybody who has a TV .
62731	0	a	, TV ,
62732	0	a	yeah .
62733	0	a	TV television we was .
62734	0	a	Yeah ,
62735	0	a	and I think today there are probably not many people who do not have a TV .
62736	0	a	Do not TV , yeah .
62737	0	a	There are a few but in general not .
62738	0	a	Now , talking about the target group which is in a sense everybody , but I think within the target group we have subgroups .
62739	0	a	We have
62740	0	a	we have earlier it was mentioned about for example elderly people who have limited function with their fingers and hands ,
62741	0	a	so I think that is one group that is certainly important .
62742	0	a	then we have just the nervous people who can never press a little button on anything unless it is really very clear .
62743	0	a	Yeah .
62744	0	a	And I do not know how much we want to cater to children is use .
62745	0	a	I mean that is a question whether that is important that children can really use it or not .
62746	0	a	So this these are just some thoughts I have on it ,
62747	0	a	and I dunno what you feel about whether we can just say we have one target group and for this one target group
62748	0	a	we are going to design this one thing or whether we are looking at what we like we we talking about different shapes , whether that different shape also includes maybe different buttons for different groups .
62749	0	a	Yeah .
62750	0	a	Well you know there is the old motto , children under six never shop alone .
62751	0	a	So if you have designed something that is very attractive to children the mummy
62752	0	a	please mummy
62753	0	a	please you know we want it now
62754	0	a	we want to go to the store and see it that has a lot of marketing pull .
62755	0	a	That has a lot of that has a lot of appeal
62756	0	a	but I think I am I am talking about the functionality now on it whether we are looking at different groups .
62757	0	a	I think the children issue can be addressed with the shape and with colours .
62758	0	a	That is right .
62759	0	a	Yeah .
62760	0	a	Different colours .
62761	1	a	You know , like you make it nice and pink , fluorescent , banana colour or whatever you know
62762	0	a	yeah , for example you know .
62763	0	a	Yes .
62764	1	a	You can make a banana shaped one .
62765	0	a	Yeah .
62766	0	a	But the question is really , who is our target group .
62767	0	a	Do we look at one target group ?
62768	0	a	And with the twenty five Euros you know can we can we afford to have
62769	1	a	I am asking the technical people here whether to look at sort of subgroups with maybe different buttons for each group
62770	0	a	how much would that throw us out of the cost we are supposed to respect ?
62771	0	a	Right .
62772	0	a	Respect .
62773	0	a	Okay .
62774	1	a	No generally we can we can design a remote which is mainly for people with f age from ten to forty and
62775	1	a	and then we can add on specific functional buttons for children as well as the elderly people or the people wit with who have nervous problems , yes .
62776	0	a	With with
62777	1	a	We can design different remotes for different people , like for aged people there will be big buttons and you know .
62778	0	a	Well that is that is
62779	0	a	Yeah .
62780	0	a	But in a family
62781	0	a	in a family there will be a aged person , children and a middle aged but they cannot buy three different remotes .
62782	0	a	yeah .
62783	0	a	Children and everybody ,
62784	0	a	yeah .
62785	0	a	They would like to buy just one and just one which can be used all the three
62786	0	a	Cost effective .
62787	0	a	Yeah of course that we can do ,
62788	1	a	but specifically if y if like elderly people want big buttons then you ca not really make a bi big remote controller
62789	1	a	so maybe specifically you can design a big con remote controller for elderly and for children , like in a different you know .
62790	0	a	What about the electronics ?
62791	0	a	That is not really going to change much , is it ?
62792	0	a	That that w that wo not change much , will it ?
62793	0	a	I d
62794	0	a	I would not think so .
62795	0	a	No , it it does not cost , yeah .
62796	0	a	No
62797	0	a	The the quest the question to be addressed here is only who is the target group and how will it function , and I think the how will it function is probably the question of the buttons you know , within the target group or subgroups .
62798	0	a	Yeah .
62799	0	a	Does not does not does not matter .
62800	0	a	Yeah .
62801	0	a	The question is only whether our budget will allow to have more than one design in a sense .
62802	0	a	Yeah .
62803	0	a	I mean the basic design I understand will be the same , but the question is how much will that set us back if let is say forty percent we make large buttons and the rest we make regular buttons for example .
62804	0	a	Okay .
62805	0	a	Yeah .
62806	0	a	Yeah .
62807	0	a	So that remains to s to be seen
62808	0	a	but the target group as a whole is is basically everybody with a TV .
62809	0	a	That is right ,
62810	0	a	and can we
62811	0	a	can we is it even feasible to make one one remote control with something for everyone , or would we have to use the same electronics and make three different shapes ?
62812	0	a	the same electronics and basically all that is going to be different is the plastic case .
62813	0	a	Yes .
62814	0	a	Yeah , well that is that is the question .
62815	0	a	And in that case we could probabl
62816	0	a	moulded plastic is not all that expensive is it ?
62817	0	a	you as an industrial person ?
62818	0	a	no .
62819	0	a	, I I
62820	0	a	I do not think no .
62821	0	a	Well maybe there is
62822	0	a	there is an idea
62823	0	a	you know t the new for example new portable phones ?
62824	0	a	They have like removable plastic cases , so you can have a striped one or you can have a fluorescent blue one , or whatever ,
62825	1	a	and maybe something like that , that in each package you know you have you
62826	1	a	you have you have for example
62827	1	a	you have let is say a fluorescent blue on it
62828	1	a	but then you have another colour or stripe whatever that already comes in a package .
62829	0	a	It is not .
62830	0	a	Yeah .
62831	0	a	Okay .
62832	0	a	Well there is a real idea
62833	0	a	yeah .
62834	0	a	And then if people really want more colours they can buy it separately .
62835	0	a	Yeah .
62836	0	a	Right .
62837	0	a	Yeah , like for mobile phones we have different you know covers , like designs and all so that w we can have that .
62838	0	a	You know ,
62839	0	a	yes .
62840	0	a	Yes .
62841	0	a	That is right ,
62842	0	a	and
62843	0	a	but like if if then everybody is is is tired of the fluorescent blue and of the striped or whatever they have as another one in the package , then they can go to the store and for a few Francs or Euros whatever they can buy an alternate package with another two colours in it you know for example you know .
62844	0	a	yeah .
62845	0	a	Yeah .
62846	0	a	An alternate package .
62847	0	a	Yeah .
62848	0	a	Okay .
62849	0	a	But yeah I I have a doubt
62850	0	a	like will it be cost wise effective if we if we design a remote having all the different features for different people or designing three different remotes for three different categories of people .
62851	0	a	Well I think I think the idea here is to to to d design one remote
62852	0	a	and what the only change is going to be
62853	0	a	the funct d t yeah
62854	0	a	the functional functional cosmetics if you want to put it that way ,
62855	1	a	having maybe larger buttons or buttons that light up or buttons that are slightly differently shaped for people either for children
62856	0	a	Five minutes that was
62857	0	a	I guess tha that is the old message .
62858	0	a	Yeah , but
62859	0	a	Yeah .
62860	0	a	Well I think we can only aff ,
62861	0	a	yeah .
62862	0	a	Okay .
62863	0	a	Cosmetic .
62864	0	a	Of th okay .
62865	0	a	Okay .
62866	0	a	Warning , finish meeting now .
62867	0	a	Finish meeting now .
62868	1	a	Well we may have to come back to one or two of these points at our next meeting but
62869	0	a	Yeah , maybe , yeah ,
62870	0	a	yeah .
62871	0	a	But I think
62872	0	a	I I think to sum it up the target group is basically everybody .
62873	1	a	If we do some more research , maybe we .
62874	1	a	If money permits we can address some features for some subgroups within that .
62875	0	a	Okay , .
62876	0	a	yeah ,
62877	0	a	I think maybe seventy percent is a unique remote controller and thirty percent
62878	0	a	is
62879	0	a	yeah
62880	0	a	it is sort of like
62881	0	a	yeah .
62882	0	a	Okay but we have to l
62883	0	a	Okay , fair enough .
62884	0	a	Do we agree , do we ?
62885	0	a	Do we agree on on that in principle , like money will tell whether we will be able to do that or not .
62886	0	a	Yeah , yeah , of course
62887	0	a	, yeah .
62888	0	a	Yes .
62889	0	a	Okay ?
62890	0	a	So now I understand it is lunch break .
62891	0	a	And .
62892	1	a	So that is what we will do .
62893	0	a	So hank you very much .
62894	0	a	 
62895	0	a	Okay .
62896	0	a	Hello everyone .
62897	0	a	Hi .
62898	0	a	Hi .
62899	0	a	Hi .
62900	0	a	how how we doing ?
62901	0	a	first we going over the minutes of the last meeting , more or less .
62902	0	a	Yeah , good .
62903	0	a	in the last meeting the marketing manager had presented her method of working , meaning gathering i suggestions from everyone to see how she best could market this this product at the within the budget that was given .
62904	0	a	in general the idea is that it should be something that is not difficult to use .
62905	0	a	it is also an item that people lose a lot .
62906	0	a	So we should address that .
62907	0	a	And , of course , it should be something s s that is very simple to use .
62908	0	a	In addition to that to make it sell , of course , the marketing manager w wishes that it be very attractive , or like she says put some sizzle into it in one way or another so that the people are buying it now because , in particular with smaller items , that is a very important fact , cause if they say , well , I go home and think about it , that wo not work .
62909	0	a	also mentioned was it should be it should have a very short learning curve .
62910	0	a	And maybe it could be sold by using a slogan .
62911	0	a	Our technical manager has then said that she feels it should have a chip that has infra red bits and it has an interface controls w interface that controls the chip .
62912	0	a	Therefore , messages will be controlled in the same manner .
62913	0	a	There should be extra features like lid buttons , maybe a beep .
62914	0	a	If too many buttons are pressed , child lock and maybe a display clock so that people could you could see the time , you know , what show they want to watch .
62915	0	a	Also mentioned was maybe different shapes .
62916	0	a	So the components of the thing should be button , bulbs , infra infra red bulbs , battery , chips , wires , and maybe some kind of a holder for the for the item .
62917	0	a	Francino who is our interface designer has mentioned that the that it , of course , should have an on off button , and also has mentioned an interesting feature that it should have maybe a channel lock .
62918	0	a	Interface designer .
62919	0	a	Particularly with maybe small children that they could not watch a channel that is undesirable .
62920	0	a	It should be compact .
62921	0	a	Her personal favourite was it should be T shaped .
62922	0	a	And maybe have an anar alarm clock .
62923	0	a	And the material should possibly be not of non allergic nature .
62924	0	a	the different systems that exist are infra red or radio waves .
62925	0	a	maybe it should have electri electrici electricity saving feature .
62926	0	a	And even possibly a timer to so that people can program their favourite program on th right from the remote .
62927	0	a	Yes .
62928	0	a	are we all in agreement that that is about what we discussed last time ?
62929	0	a	Okay .
62930	0	a	Yeah .
62931	0	a	Yes .
62932	0	a	Yeah , I think that pretty much is it .
62933	0	a	Yeah .
62934	0	a	Okay ,
62935	0	a	then we I am looking for three presentations .
62936	0	a	And I do not know whether the order matters much , I do not I do not think so ,
62937	1	a	so whoever w wants
62938	0	a	Yeah , okay .
62939	1	a	Okay , I can start first .
62940	0	a	Okay .
62941	1	a	Now my slide , please .
62942	1	a	Okay , your slides .
62943	1	a	Okay .
62944	0	a	Oh , come on , close already .
62945	0	a	And that is number two , right ?
62946	0	a	Three .
62947	0	a	Three .
62948	0	a	Participant three .
62949	0	a	Yes .
62950	0	a	Okay .
62951	0	a	Okay .
62952	0	a	Now as an interface designer , I would give more emphasis on the interface , how the remote looks like so that it is sellable , it is attractive to customers .
62953	1	a	Next , please .
62954	0	a	Okay .
62955	0	a	Now the function of a remote is to send messages to the television .
62956	0	a	This messages could be switch on off message or switch to next channel message or swapping the channels or switching onto a particular channel , like you can have the numbers one , two , three , four , up to nine .
62957	0	a	Nine what ?
62958	0	a	Nine channel switches ?
62959	0	a	Nine channel switches ?
62960	0	a	Is
62961	0	a	Yeah .
62962	0	a	Pardon me ?
62963	0	a	Yes , nine numbers .
62964	0	a	And then you have swapping of button by which using which you can swap the channels if you do not want to see the third channel you can swap it to the fourth channel or vice versa .
62965	0	a	Then it should have a next button , and next button channel by which you can keep on v eh scrolling the channels one by one .
62966	0	a	Going to the nex next .
62967	1	a	Next slide , please .
62968	0	a	Then you should have a button which should which ca which can be used for increasing or decreasing the volume .
62969	0	a	Then , there should be a button which can give subtitles for a particular program which is going on a television .
62970	0	a	For example , if you are watching a French program and you would like to have a subtitles in English , then there should be a channel which can trigger this mechanism in the television so that the user can see the the subtitles on the screen .
62971	0	a	Then there should d there should be some buttons which can control features like the colour , colour of the picture , the contrast , sharpness , brightness of the picture .
62972	0	a	Now there should be a memory switch .
62973	0	a	There should be a mute button .
62974	0	a	Suddenly if if if viewer he gets a telephone call , and if he want he does not want to switch off the TV , but he he can reduce the sound , he can bring the volume down and he can watch he can while talking he can watch the TV .
62975	0	a	Now the most important feature I would like to have in my remote would be the speech recognition feature .
62976	0	a	It is an integrated progra programmable sample sensor speaker unit .
62977	0	a	So a remote can be th can be designed which can have the voice recognisers , you can record your own voice which can be recognised by as voice recogniser in the television , for example , if you want to see we if you want to see the ninth channel if you say just say ninth channel , th now the the yeah , the remote will automatically it will switch to the ninth channel .
62978	0	a	So the TV will have some recogniser which will recognise the user is voice and accordingly it will change its functionalities .
62979	0	a	So this is one of the very important feature a remote control can have .
62980	0	a	So this is one one of the interface which can be created .
62981	0	a	A very simple interface which has all the t important features .
62982	1	a	Then , please , next slide .
62983	0	a	Then , these are some of the remotes which are different in shape and colour , but they have many buttons .
62984	0	a	So sometimes the user finds it very difficult to recognise which button is for what function and all that .
62985	0	a	So you can you can design an interface which is very simple , and which is user friendly .
62986	0	a	Even a kid can use that .
62987	1	a	So can you go on t t to the next slide .
62988	0	a	Yeah , so this is one of the interface or one of the remote which has this vi voice recogniser .
62989	0	a	And this has multi purpose use , it can be used for TV , it can be used for cable satellite , it can be used for VCR , DVDs and audio .
62990	0	a	And this has in built voice recogniser .
62991	1	a	Can you go on to the next slide ?
62992	0	a	Yeah , now this is an interface for a chil for a remote which a child can use .
62993	0	a	this is user friendly , it is very attractive and children can use it as well as they can play with it .
62994	0	a	And this comes with different colours , different shapes .
62995	0	a	And this this child interface has minimum buttons and all the important buttons are there in this small , compact , attractive child interface .
62996	1	a	Next slide , please .
62997	0	a	Now this is a big over sized remote which cannot be misplaced or it is impossible to misplace .
62998	0	a	You do not know me .
62999	0	a	this .
63000	0	a	I could lose that in a minute .
63001	0	a	So this is
63002	0	a	No this is a very big , you cannot misplace it anywhere .
63003	0	a	So this is a jumbo universal remote control and it is impossible to im misplace or lose .
63004	0	a	This i this is one such interface which can be created .
63005	1	a	And the personal preference would be a spe to incorporate speech recognisers which will respond to user is voice for a particular function .
63006	0	a	Right .
63007	0	a	Thank you ,
63008	0	a	that is
63009	0	a	yes .
63010	0	a	Okay , thank you very much .
63011	0	a	any comments on her presentation ?
63012	0	a	Yeah , I I th
63013	0	a	I think
63014	1	a	No , I think the these are her presentations , but as far as the decision making we getting to that after after
63015	0	a	but if
63016	0	a	I just wanted to know whether anybody had any any anything to add to her presentation .
63017	0	a	Well , looks like we still have quite a choice of things out there .
63018	0	a	what I am
63019	0	a	No suggestion is bad .
63020	1	a	But we are going to have to narrow it down a little more .
63021	0	a	I do not think that we can get
63022	0	a	The T shape is good , the child one is good , the too big to misplace , I think it is just funny .
63023	0	a	I do not think that is going to be our impulse purchase at the checkout counter .
63024	0	a	Okay .
63025	0	a	Okay .
63026	0	a	It is it is going to be a little bit too unwieldy .
63027	0	a	Yeah .
63028	0	a	Have to come back to that later .
63029	0	a	We can .
63030	0	a	Okay .
63031	0	a	No , I think her presentation was good , and she really explored all the options .
63032	0	a	right .
63033	0	a	Yeah .
63034	1	a	Ho who wants to go next ?
63035	1	a	Yeah , maybe .
63036	0	a	Okay ,
63037	0	a	and you
63038	0	a	okay .
63039	0	a	Participant two .
63040	0	a	the next one , sorry .
63041	0	a	Oops .
63042	0	a	It is it was the old one .
63043	0	a	Components .
63044	0	a	The components design .
63045	0	a	Okay .
63046	1	a	this time I am I am going to concentrate more on the components and the technical side of the remote controller design .
63047	1	a	, can you go on to the next slide , please .
63048	0	a	I have just brief down few components which we require for the remote control construction .
63049	0	a	the first one is case to keep all the components like integrated circuit , battery , etcetera , etcetera ,
63050	0	a	it is like
63051	0	a	it can be a plastic one , hard plastic , so that it can be strong , even if you just , you know , if you if it falls down , then it does not break .
63052	0	a	So it should be strong .
63053	0	a	And there are no harmful materials used in that .
63054	0	a	And it should be recyclable .
63055	0	a	and ,
63056	0	a	yeah ,
63057	0	a	and also using of colouring compon components like if we want to have different colours , blue , red , green , so we have to use some colouring compone compone components .
63058	0	a	Good point .
63059	0	a	And the second important thing is integrated circuit .
63060	0	a	which we can use a highly sophisticated one because it is like the it is like the heart of the remote controller .
63061	1	a	If it is not efficient then everything wi is going to be like the lef ess less efficient
63062	1	a	so it
63063	1	a	you should we should have a highly sophisticated one .
63064	0	a	And it should be resistant to high as well as low temperatures .
63065	0	a	Suppose if it is thirty eight degrees outside forty degrees outside , it should it should be able to re resist the temperature highs and high temperatures and low temperatures .
63066	1	a	And it should be with equipped with timer and alarm facility .
63067	0	a	And the other component we should we have in the remote controller is a resistor which is like i it is very very much important for the electricity flow through through through the remote controller and also a capacitor which is a b which is a m I think it is it is like a battery , capacitor .
63068	1	a	Can you go on to the next slide , please ?
63069	0	a	a diode , a transistor , a resonator , these are all this technical electri electronic compons components which are which we have to use in a remote controller .
63070	0	a	A battery
63071	1	a	, I would like to suggest one thing
63072	0	a	if we
63073	0	a	if we will be able to make a res rechargeable battery then we sh we need not go for a high performance battery , even if it is a low performance battery
63074	0	a	it ca it ca not l it ca not charge much .
63075	0	a	It it it is not a high voltage battery .
63076	0	a	Then also we can If it is a rechargeable one , then people can use it for a long time , so in that way we can cut cut the cost , but w that we have to make the battery as rechargeable one .
63077	0	a	And we we have a circuit board in a remote controller .
63078	1	a	Can you go to the next slide , please .
63079	0	a	And how it works , how the remote controller works .
63080	0	a	Thank you .
63081	1	a	Go away .
63082	0	a	when you press a button , when you do that , you complete a specific connection that means when you when you press a button there will be a s a small circuit underneath the button , and it will send some signals through the wires , and then the chip will send start connection and knows that which button is pressed .
63083	0	a	Suppose you have pressed channel one button , number one you have pressed , then the chip will know that the number one button was pressed .
63084	0	a	It pros produces a mors morse code line signal specific to that button .
63085	0	a	Every button , every individual button , has its own morse code .
63086	0	a	Suppose the user has pressed butto button one , then it will have a spe the circuit will generate a specific morse code to b that that button , and the transistor will amplify the signal and send then to the LED which translates the signal into infrared light .
63087	0	a	Like you have got a signal by pressing a button .
63088	0	a	That is a d a morse code has been generated by the integrated circuit .
63089	0	a	Now , that signal , that morse code , has to be amplified by the transistor .
63090	0	a	That is the use of transist transistor we which we use in the remote controller .
63091	0	a	It will amplify the signal and it will send it to the LED and which translates the signal into an infra infrared bits .
63092	0	a	The sensor on the TV can see the infrared light , and seeing the signal seeing the signal re it reacts appropriately , that when it sees the amplified mo morse code signal , then it will it will know which what what action it has to do .
63093	0	a	Then it will do the appropriate action .
63094	0	a	So this is how the remote controller works .
63095	0	a	It works .
63096	1	a	Can you go to the next slide , please .
63097	0	a	Yeah , I have few pictures .
63098	0	a	When you look at the remote controller it is it is it
63099	0	a	this is a normal remote controller .
63100	1	a	And to the next slide , please .
63101	0	a	And where we had a a few buttons and all .
63102	0	a	And if you open the remote controller you have this circui circuit board and few electronic components , like you can see a chip there which is having eighteen pins , and also a capac a capacitor , three resistors and also a resonator
63103	0	a	yeah ,
63104	0	a	and di and a diode transistor .
63105	0	a	The electronic components
63106	0	a	all of the electronic components have all those things like a chip and d diode transistors an
63107	0	a	Yeah , di can y
63108	0	a	you can see the TA double one eight three five labelled chip .
63109	0	a	yes .
63110	0	a	Yes .
63111	0	a	you can also see the the green two green things are these are they are
63112	0	a	they are resistors , and just beside that you can see a transistor , and a cylinder shape , that one is a capacitor .
63113	0	a	and also there are resistors
63114	0	a	sorry , ther there is a diode .
63115	1	a	Can you go go on to the next slide .
63116	0	a	So this is the circuit board .
63117	0	a	The green one is a circuit board .
63118	0	a	Actually , building a circuit bo board is pretty pretty easy and also it is a it is a l l inexpensive .
63119	0	a	it is it costs less than what you print on a paper , because when you when you are building some circuits some circuits and also wires , it is it is better to go for printing , because you can build these kind of k circuit boards on a on a bulk and it is just printing , nothing like , you know , you do not need to use wires and all .
63120	0	a	It is not exactly wires we are using .
63121	0	a	It is just printing something on a board .
63122	0	a	Tha tho those prints will acti act as wires and ci circuits .
63123	0	a	So th that green thing is a circuit board , and also you can see there are b s like access for buttons , like when you press a button , the circuit under the button will be activated
63124	0	a	th it will
63125	0	a	it will he get some signals from it and it will it will ch its ch se send a signal signals to the , yeah , integrated circuit .
63126	0	a	Transmit .
63127	1	a	Can you go to the next slide , please .
63128	0	a	so this is
63129	0	a	these are the circuits un underneath the buttons .
63130	0	a	can you see the black , round marks ?
63131	0	a	They they are the circuits .
63132	0	a	Yes .
63133	1	a	Next , please .
63134	0	a	And like we have designed before we have seen some few things like instead off buttons we have some scrolls .
63135	0	a	b but a b a push button requires a simple chip underneath it , but whereas a scroll wheel requires normally a regular chip which is a higher price range .
63136	0	a	Okay .
63137	0	a	Like for s scrolls we have to go for a sophisticated and and k full a complete chip .
63138	0	a	Okay .
63139	0	a	and a as energy source we offer a basic battery , a more ingenious hard dynamo , a kinetic provision of energy , more than what is that you shake casually to provide energy .
63140	0	a	So that also we can have in a battery , or we can use solar sells .
63141	0	a	, that is interesting .
63142	0	a	Yeah .
63143	0	a	yeah
63144	0	a	the product can be de delivered into different cases .
63145	0	a	usually , the cases and card flat that w we see usually d a normal remote controller .
63146	0	a	Okay .
63147	0	a	Okay .
63148	0	a	Yeah .
63149	0	a	And you have more pictures .
63150	0	a	we have five minutes to the end of the meeting .
63151	0	a	Yeah , maybe d I have just one more slide , I think .
63152	0	a	Like we can have a ma material such as plastic , rubber , wood , titanium , but titanium we ca not use .
63153	0	a	and also for electronics we can use a simple and regular re or an advanced chip on the print , also infra it includes the infrared se sender .
63154	0	a	yeah
63155	0	a	the for the movie just to j develop samples and so spe sample speaker .
63156	0	a	An
63157	0	a	Yeah , that is it .
63158	0	a	It is all for me now ,
63159	0	a	thank you .
63160	0	a	Okay ,
63161	0	a	well thank you .
63162	0	a	Any particular comments by anybody ?
63163	0	a	We do not have a lot of time left
63164	1	a	and we will still have to make a decision , and the marketing expert has to present her her thing .
63165	0	a	yeah , on the scroll and the push button , ca you can achieve scrolling by repeatedly pushing a button ?
63166	0	a	No , no , no , th
63167	0	a	the the the scrolling wheels are different , like you can go for a sw switches like buttons or scrolls , which which we used to do before ten ten years before , I think .
63168	0	a	Now , nobody uses that because you need you need a a k sophisticated chip and all .
63169	1	a	So I think it is better we go for ordinary buttons .
63170	0	a	We will just go for push buttons for in the interest of cost .
63171	0	a	Yeah yeah
63172	0	a	, push buttons .
63173	0	a	Push buttons .
63174	0	a	Yeah .
63175	0	a	Yeah .
63176	0	a	Okay .
63177	0	a	Okay .
63178	1	a	Go right to my first my next slide .
63179	1	a	okay .
63180	0	a	alright , my method is I am interested in what the competition is doing , and want to see how we can make ourselves different from the competition , so I have really been looking at the press and the ads that are out there for other remote controllers .
63181	0	a	I s
63182	0	a	I spend a lot of time on the internet surfing around doing the same thing .
63183	0	a	And then when I am out in people is houses or at meetings or anything like that , I try to notice what kind of remote controls people have , and if it is convenient in the conversation I ask about it .
63184	1	a	And I would encourage you all to do the same .
63185	0	a	and my findings from this is that , you know , small is beautiful .
63186	0	a	people like something that really fits in their hand .
63187	0	a	Kay .
63188	0	a	Simple is beautiful .
63189	0	a	They do not want to have to squint at small print , they want buttons whose functions are obvious , and they want as few buttons as possible , and they do not care for the mode thing .
63190	0	a	They want each button to do something .
63191	0	a	And eye catching is important .
63192	0	a	It is gotta look cute , it is gotta look appealing .
63193	1	a	Go ahead ,
63194	1	a	I am trying to finish fast for you .
63195	1	a	and our preference is , as far as I am concerned , are we got to get to the market before the competition .
63196	0	a	Ours has to be look really great and it has to come out before the others , so that we have a leg up on time to sell it and push it before other people get out their Christmas item .
63197	1	a	And we should develop one or two features we can really dwell on in our ad campaign .
63198	0	a	If we try to tell people it has too many great features , the consumer just gets confused and we do not get anywhere .
63199	1	a	So we have gotta narrow our selection down to li two things , I think , that we going to say are really great about our our our new product .
63200	0	a	And I have been looking around at what designs every year different things are popular .
63201	0	a	And in my research this year I found out that fruit and vegetable shapes are really popular .
63202	0	a	And people are tired of hard plastic and hard metal .
63203	0	a	They are more back into soft feel , spongy feeling things , things with maybe a little cloth on them .
63204	1	a	So those are things maybe we want to look at as far as saleability of the item .
63205	0	a	Okay .
63206	0	a	that concludes the presentation of everyone .
63207	1	a	And what we really have to decide in this meeting is the concept of the remote .
63208	1	a	And so what do we think on the concept of the remote ?
63209	0	a	Y
63210	0	a	Okay .
63211	1	a	You want to try to come back to yours , and limit yours a bit ?
63212	0	a	Okay .
63213	1	a	yes ,
63214	1	a	I would like to include this feature which is called as voice recogniser .
63215	0	a	So speech recognition is most important as far as you are concerned ?
63216	0	a	Yeah h that could that could that could be our star feature .
63217	0	a	Yeah , but w
63218	0	a	Yeah .
63219	0	a	This could be one feature which could be sellable .
63220	0	a	I think that is
63221	0	a	That that be really good ,
63222	0	a	yeah ,
63223	0	a	I agree with that .
63224	0	a	Yeah ,
63225	0	a	but but I what I am very very much doubtful how how far it will work ,
63226	0	a	because a speech recogniser like i it it has its own problems , issues .
63227	0	a	Distance problem ?
63228	0	a	Yeah , it is not distance problem
63229	0	a	it it is recognising a person is voice , like maybe different people will be having different voices ,
63230	0	a	so it like it is everything
63231	0	a	so
63232	0	a	i
63233	0	a	So to get a good recogni recognising system , it is a costly thing , I think .
63234	0	a	Well , you you teach
63235	0	a	You have to teach
63236	0	a	Okay , before we get too far off here ,
63237	0	a	the components of the concept is the energy .
63238	0	a	No , it is it is , yeah ,
63239	0	a	it it is like your recording of all a question already , and then you are expecting an answer from th
63240	0	a	For example , you have a TV system , I am the user and my family members are the user , I will already record a question like , good morning , like around eight o'clock I want to see the news in the television .
63241	0	a	Yeah , but
63242	0	a	Yeah .
63243	0	a	So I will say just good morning and the TV will switch on .
63244	0	a	It will recognise my voice and will switch on .
63245	0	a	Yeah .
63246	1	a	What kind of energy do we foresee ?
63247	0	a	Battery .
63248	1	a	I think I think battery ,
63249	0	a	and I think we all agreed on that .
63250	0	a	Battery .
63251	0	a	Battery .
63252	0	a	That that is that is going to be most cost effective and the best thing .
63253	0	a	Yes .
63254	0	a	Yeah .
63255	0	a	Yeah .
63256	0	a	Okay then chip on print .
63257	0	a	Yeah .
63258	0	a	Yep .
63259	0	a	Yes .
63260	0	a	Okay .
63261	0	a	And the case .
63262	0	a	And I think we all agree on the case ,
63263	1	a	we want to have something maybe bright , colourful .
63264	0	a	Yeah .
63265	0	a	Bright , colourful , trendy trendy design , and strong .
63266	0	a	And compact .
63267	0	a	And also strong .
63268	0	a	Trendy , yeah .
63269	0	a	Trendy design and compact .
63270	0	a	Trendy design , compact and strong .
63271	0	a	Yes .
63272	1	a	User interface concept , interface type , supplements
63273	0	a	That will be your area I think , right , Jana .
63274	0	a	like the switches , like we use buttons for user interface .
63275	0	a	Push buttons .
63276	0	a	Put k I guess for
63277	0	a	yeah .
63278	0	a	Push buttons .
63279	0	a	And
63280	0	a	Not sure what they mean by supplements .
63281	0	a	And
63282	0	a	Supplements like different types of features buttons , like can have a f mute button or a swapping button .
63283	0	a	Yeah .
63284	0	a	Well , I think that
63285	0	a	Yeah ,
63286	0	a	or or like her speech recognition would also be a supplement .
63287	0	a	Oh , like
63288	0	a	Oh .
63289	0	a	Her speech recognition feature would be a supplement .
63290	0	a	A what ?
63291	0	a	Right , right , right , .
63292	0	a	Recogniser .
63293	0	a	yeah .
63294	0	a	Yes .
63295	1	a	Okay , so why do not we put down speech recognition if possible pending some more research from our industrial engineer on how expensive that is .
63296	0	a	Yeah .
63297	0	a	Right .
63298	0	a	Yes .
63299	0	a	Okay .
63300	0	a	our next meeting will be in thirty minutes ,
63301	0	a	and the ID is to
63302	0	a	this is the individual actions to be taken until then , to have the look and feel design , and the UID is supposed to come up with the user interface design , and the marketing expert with the product evaluation .
63303	0	a	Okay .
63304	0	a	In this phase , the two of you , Jana and Francine , have to work together on a prototype using modelling clay , it says here .
63305	0	a	Okay .
63306	0	a	You will receive specific instructions will be sent to you by your coaches .
63307	0	a	Okay .
63308	1	a	if you have any questions , you know , you you can always contact me or or your coach , I suppose .
63309	0	a	so
63310	0	a	I think we conclude the meeting here and we come back in thirty minutes , according to our timetable here .
63311	0	a	Yeah .
63312	0	a	Okay .
63313	0	a	 
63314	0	a	Well hi everyone again .
63315	0	a	Hello .
63316	0	a	Hello .
63317	0	a	Hello
63318	1	a	like before we I have to redo the meetings from n th the minutes from the last meeting
63319	0	a	and so here we go .
63320	0	a	it was discussed in the last meeting which was opened by the presentation from the interface designer that looks would be very important on this new remote and it is to send messages of course to the TV .
63321	0	a	Designer .
63322	0	a	It should have nine channel buttons , a next button , volume buttons , subtitle buttons , switch to control features , colour contrast , sharpness etcetera .
63323	0	a	It should have a memory switch , a mute button in case the telephone rings or something .
63324	0	a	speech recognition is one of her very f favourite personal features she would like see d d to be integrated in this in this new remote .
63325	0	a	Should be child friendly design with few buttons , colourful maybe with s star shaped or other shaped buttons .
63326	0	a	she presented also an oversized remote which she guarantees nobody will ever be able to lose .
63327	0	a	that is right .
63328	0	a	And she was challenged on that point
63329	0	a	Okay .
63330	0	a	Yes .
63331	0	a	But her very f personal favourite really she , she would very much like to see a speech recogniser integrated in this remote .
63332	0	a	The industrial designer presented her thoughts on the issue .
63333	0	a	She would like a special case made out of plastic that is very strong , not using any harmful materials , should be recyclable and should be colourful .
63334	0	a	Should have an integrated circuit board that is highly sophisticated and temperature resistant .
63335	0	a	She would like to see a timer and or alarm facility integrated .
63336	0	a	technically this thing would also have a resistor and a capacitor , diode transistor , resonator , and if possible a rechargeable battery .
63337	0	a	and of course a circuit board .
63338	0	a	And how it would works , you press the button , the chip is morse morse code related relays the to the generat to the generator amplification and the circuit board is very inexpensive to build and so she thinks this is a great feature to to to consider .
63339	0	a	She would like this whole thing should be push buttons with a simple chip scrolling method is more expensive and not that practical anymore .
63340	0	a	Should be battery operated and of course she would have the special cases .
63341	0	a	The marketing expert who has to finally come up with to to to market this product has been watching the competition , has done some research on the internet and also has used h her personal observations to come up with the fact that such a remote sh should be small , easy to use and it should be eye catching .
63342	0	a	From her point of view of course one of the most important facts is that we should get to market before our competition does .
63343	0	a	To do that maybe one or two features should be developed on which we could dwell on or in other words on which our campaign could be built on .
63344	0	a	Too many new features or too many points would only confuse matter .
63345	0	a	So we prefer to have one or two features that can be really driven home .
63346	0	a	it should have a fruit and vegetable design and should have a soft feel .
63347	0	a	She feels that is really what people want today .
63348	0	a	And the decision that we took last time was that the special feature we would like to see is a speech recogniser , the energy should be battery should be on a chip , should be trendy design , compact and strong , and should have buttons .
63349	0	a	And that concludes the presentation from the last minutes from the last meeting .
63350	0	a	Now we are ready for the presentation of the prototype .
63351	0	a	Yeah .
63352	0	a	Yeah .
63353	0	a	Just the look like ,
63354	1	a	the button part I will explain .
63355	0	a	Yeah .
63356	0	a	so this is our what we have made .
63357	0	a	This is a model of the remote control which we are going to build .
63358	0	a	this is us in a snail shape
63359	0	a	so it it is attractive
63360	0	a	and it is
63361	0	a	it is blue in colour bright and it has yellow buttons and all the different colour buttons
63362	0	a	so it is a a looks wise it is beautiful .
63363	0	a	and also compact in shape .
63364	0	a	and also i it it will be easily fit into into the hands
63365	0	a	and you can access all the buttons easily .
63366	0	a	Good .
63367	0	a	Yeah ,
63368	0	a	oops ,
63369	0	a	sorry .
63370	0	a	You used to have all the buttons
63371	0	a	Oh that is good , no , that is nice and friendly .
63372	0	a	yeah and
63373	0	a	the material which we are going to use for the case is plastic and w which which is s strong
63374	0	a	and also for the
63375	0	a	the material is plastic and for the buttons it is s soft rubber
63376	0	a	and als
63377	0	a	yeah .
63378	0	a	Yeah because you will be touching the buttons more so it is soft when you touch it .
63379	0	a	And then for the for the led , for the light emitting diode it is a fluorescent green and it is a a
63380	0	a	it is a bulb like an ordinary infrared .
63381	0	a	And
63382	0	a	and the button button is part will be explained by F Francina .
63383	0	a	Okay .
63384	0	a	Okay .
63385	0	a	Now the
63386	0	a	we decided upon including certain features on our remote .
63387	0	a	Now these features includes the s signal emitting signal it is the led or LED the infrared .
63388	0	a	Yeah , okay , .
63389	0	a	Now we have included the switch on and off button .
63390	0	a	Now we have included another feature that is the mute button on the side of the model .
63391	0	a	Then we have included one to nine buttons for controlling the programmes the different channels .
63392	0	a	We have also included two buttons for increasing or decreasing the volume .
63393	0	a	And we have also included two buttons for scrolling up and scrolling down the programme channels .
63394	0	a	Now our our model also contains a button which is called as the menu button .
63395	0	a	What kind of button ?
63396	0	a	Menu ?
63397	0	a	menu th menu , one one .
63398	0	a	Menu button .
63399	0	a	Yes , menu At the centre we have included a button which is fluorescent green colour and this is the menu button which will control the colour , sharpness , brightness of this picture .
63400	0	a	Menu button .
63401	0	a	Of the screen .
63402	0	a	We have also included a button which is called as the swapping button .
63403	0	a	Now this is a special , special feature which we have included .
63404	0	a	Now this button is an elongated shaped button and this is slightly flexible so if it is turned towards the right it will take to the previous channel , if it is turned towards the right it will take to the next channel .
63405	0	a	It will take the user to the previous and the next channel so this is a swapping button .
63406	0	a	The next channel in the numeric pattern , or
63407	0	a	Yeah , .
63408	0	a	No , swapping is if if example you are you are watching the second channel
63409	0	a	and then you go to the tenth channel
63410	0	a	and if you want to go back to the second channel you can swap , this button .
63411	0	a	Okay , okay .
63412	0	a	Yes .
63413	0	a	And at the end , it this remote has inbuilt voice recogniser which c which will recognise the user is voice and then it will act accordingly .
63414	0	a	Okay .
63415	0	a	So this is our proposed model .
63416	0	a	Okay .
63417	1	a	Now the marketing expert has to give her suggestion whether it will be sellable or it will be cost effective .
63418	1	a	Tell , yeah .
63419	0	a	Okay , well what
63420	0	a	what I really like a lot about it is that you can reach the whole thing with one thumb , that you can really hold it in one h you do not need two hands and it is easily reachable even for somebody with a small hand ,
63421	0	a	yeah ?
63422	0	a	The buttons are all raised and if you hold it in the centre of your hand you can even reach it over here
63423	0	a	so you do not have to turn it around , turn it upside down , move it up , up and down ,
63424	0	a	I really like that .
63425	0	a	Yes , yes .
63426	0	a	Yes the buttons are all raised , right ?
63427	0	a	Are raised , .
63428	0	a	Yes .
63429	0	a	Right .
63430	0	a	Or have two hands to operate it , yeah .
63431	0	a	You really did a good job on that , my little designers .
63432	0	a	and
63433	0	a	I like the idea that the on off button is in a really prominent place .
63434	0	a	That is that is a really good good thing .
63435	0	a	Yes ,
63436	0	a	and it sort of sticks up
63437	0	a	so that you really
63438	0	a	you do not have to g
63439	0	a	first go like
63440	0	a	oh yeah
63441	0	a	here it is on
63442	0	a	and yeah , .
63443	0	a	Yeah , that is great .
63444	0	a	Abs
63445	0	a	okay .
63446	0	a	The colour is very attractive .
63447	0	a	the these buttons around here are the mute
63448	0	a	and
63449	0	a	these
63450	0	a	On both sides they are mute ?
63451	0	a	So you can push either one ?
63452	0	a	Okay .
63453	0	a	No , these the front buttons which are here , are the mute buttons .
63454	0	a	Yes , yes .
63455	0	a	Yes .
63456	0	a	So if you are left handed or right handed it does not matter .
63457	0	a	And this brings the menu up on the screen ?
63458	0	a	This brings the menu up on the screen
63459	0	a	and the orange ones are
63460	0	a	Okay .
63461	0	a	Pardon me ?
63462	0	a	This is the menu yes , yes .
63463	0	a	A the the these
63464	0	a	these two are th to increase or decrease the volumes , and these two are to scroll the programme channels .
63465	0	a	F f okay .
63466	0	a	Right , very good .
63467	0	a	Scroll up or scroll down the channels .
63468	0	a	it looks looks like something I can sell .
63469	1	a	Okay and now I am supposed to
63470	0	a	yeah .
63471	1	a	Well , I have one question
63472	0	a	will there be anything written on the buttons , like that people know , or they have to learn that from a piece of paper which button does what ?
63473	0	a	Will have symbols so that that that the user really knows you know and does not have to first learn it
63474	0	a	Yeah .
63475	0	a	Yes , it will have these buttons will have the numbers and all the rest of the buttons will have symbols .
63476	0	a	Yeah , definitely .
63477	0	a	Yes , which can be easily recognised .
63478	0	a	Yeah .
63479	0	a	Yeah .
63480	0	a	Yeah .
63481	0	a	Yeah .
63482	0	a	Yes .
63483	0	a	Yeah .
63484	0	a	Good point
63485	0	a	because we need the symbols cause we are going into an international market we ca not have anything that is language dependent .
63486	0	a	Yes .
63487	0	a	Yeah of course ,
63488	0	a	and also
63489	0	a	Yes .
63490	0	a	Yeah .
63491	0	a	But anyway it would ha
63492	0	a	i
63493	0	a	i i
63494	0	a	it has to have some kind of of symbols , text or something so that people kn
63495	0	a	That is right .
63496	0	a	Yes .
63497	0	a	Yeah we can
63498	0	a	Text .
63499	0	a	Symbols on it .
63500	0	a	Yes .
63501	0	a	Text that we can have on the case itself ,
63502	0	a	we can
63503	0	a	it will be printed on the case and symbols as well as the buttons .
63504	0	a	Yes .
63505	0	a	Okay ,
63506	0	a	yeah just wanted make sure of that .
63507	0	a	And
63508	0	a	and one more feature is we we have a holder for this remote which is an oyster shape .
63509	0	a	Yeah .
63510	0	a	, kay , .
63511	0	a	A shell shape .
63512	0	a	For the snail , yeah , , we have the snail shell .
63513	0	a	Right , .
63514	0	a	Yes , yes .
63515	0	a	Yeah .
63516	0	a	So it is
63517	0	a	yeah ,
63518	0	a	yeah shell .
63519	0	a	Yes , snail shell .
63520	0	a	He goes right back into his shell .
63521	0	a	Yes .
63522	0	a	Right .
63523	1	a	Well you know I think we could do something really funny with this too
63524	0	a	because the snail is known to be slow
63525	1	a	and we could have some sort of little comic effect on our marketing about how this is a rapid snail or something like that
63526	0	a	you know that would , that would really work .
63527	0	a	Y
63528	0	a	Yes
63529	0	a	Yes .
63530	0	a	Yeah , of course , yeah .
63531	1	a	Now what , what are our special features for the marketing ?
63532	0	a	That is really the voice recognition that is really unusual
63533	1	a	And then , and then the other thing would basically be sh shape or practicality of use .
63534	0	a	So
63535	0	a	I think voice recognition is our big selling point
63536	0	a	cause nobody else seems to have that in in this price range .
63537	0	a	Yep well I think that everybody is going to say their remote control is practical .
63538	0	a	You know .
63539	1	a	I think we have to , we have to dwell on on on the appearance .
63540	1	a	Colours .
63541	0	a	We are really going to have the be the cutest remote control on the block .
63542	0	a	Cutest .
63543	0	a	Yeah .
63544	1	a	So I think we have to play with the image , play with the snail image play with the visual and then the voice recognition .
63545	1	a	I think those are the two things to push .
63546	1	a	The look and the voice recognition .
63547	1	a	They are going to be our two selling points .
63548	0	a	Okay ,
63549	0	a	now having said that
63550	0	a	No , now this was our evaluation criteria which we just have done .
63551	0	a	I am supposed to make a little presentation , are not I ?
63552	0	a	Okay .
63553	0	a	Now we are going to talk about financing .
63554	0	a	, but in my instructions I think it said I was supposed to go to the board and do something .
63555	0	a	No ?
63556	0	a	Yeah , that is me .
63557	0	a	Well , there is a production evaluation .
63558	0	a	Is that you ?
63559	0	a	But that is after the financing .
63560	0	a	Oh , okay .
63561	0	a	See ?
63562	0	a	Fi see ?
63563	0	a	Sorry , sorry .
63564	0	a	Mm mm .
63565	0	a	Okay , we had looks and voice recognition .
63566	0	a	Okay now on the financing we bring up the
63567	0	a	there it is .
63568	0	a	Okay energy source we say that is battery , right ?
63569	0	a	Okay , now .
63570	0	a	That is right .
63571	0	a	So we I guess we use one .
63572	0	a	Yeah .
63573	0	a	What ?
63574	0	a	T cell or chart
63575	0	a	you are trying to change is protected .
63576	0	a	Well , that is nice .
63577	0	a	She told me I could just ch change it here
63578	0	a	and then it would It does not work .
63579	0	a	Can you just fill it in in the yellow boxes ?
63580	0	a	Or
63581	0	a	Well .
63582	0	a	Oh , okay yeah
63583	0	a	, okay ,
63584	0	a	let is see .
63585	0	a	Yeah .
63586	0	a	Okay , one , okay .
63587	0	a	Yes .
63588	0	a	Oh go away .
63589	0	a	kinetic source
63590	0	a	so that is in the energy source that is all we need .
63591	0	a	electronics , simple chip on print ?
63592	0	a	Is that is what we are using ?
63593	0	a	One of those ?
63594	0	a	Come on .
63595	0	a	Yeah ,
63596	0	a	yeah .
63597	0	a	Yes .
63598	0	a	Okay , one .
63599	0	a	regular chip on print .
63600	0	a	No .
63601	0	a	No .
63602	0	a	That is all we need , the one case , uncurved flat , single curved , double curved .
63603	0	a	Yeah .
63604	0	a	This is a
63605	0	a	Yeah .
63606	0	a	Single curve ?
63607	0	a	I guess it is double curved .
63608	0	a	Double curved ?
63609	0	a	One of those ?
63610	0	a	Case materi s supplements .
63611	0	a	Plastic we said ,
63612	0	a	right ? wood , rubber ?
63613	0	a	but , yes but
63614	0	a	That is just for the case material , so special colours though , we having that ,
63615	0	a	right ?
63616	0	a	And then we have to interface push buttons .
63617	0	a	Plastic .
63618	0	a	Rubber , because we are going to have the soft buttons .
63619	0	a	Yeah .
63620	0	a	I think that is f for rubbers that is yeah case material .
63621	0	a	Is this for the case ?
63622	0	a	Yes .
63623	0	a	Oh okay , the , mm' kay .
63624	0	a	Yes .
63625	0	a	Yes .
63626	0	a	Scroll wheel , no .
63627	0	a	Integrated scroll wheel ,
63628	0	a	LC display ?
63629	0	a	Button .
63630	0	a	No , cause we did not put the clock in it after all ,
63631	0	a	right ?
63632	0	a	No .
63633	0	a	No .
63634	0	a	Yeah .
63635	0	a	, button supplement special colour ?
63636	0	a	Special form ?
63637	0	a	And special material , rubber , wood , yes .
63638	0	a	Speci
63639	0	a	Yes Yes d we do have special form .
63640	0	a	Yes .
63641	0	a	Yeah .
63642	0	a	Okay .
63643	0	a	Total seven point six whatever that means .
63644	0	a	, I think that is the price .
63645	0	a	That is the price .
63646	0	a	One two three four five six seven eight nine
63647	0	a	Nine points ,
63648	0	a	okay , yes .
63649	0	a	Maybe it is it just n
63650	0	a	Yeah .
63651	0	a	Eight , eight point two .
63652	0	a	That is
63653	0	a	Eight point two , right ?
63654	0	a	So , we
63655	0	a	looks like we are well within budget .
63656	0	a	Okay .
63657	0	a	Okay .
63658	0	a	I guess I should save this
63659	0	a	I suppose , huh ?
63660	0	a	Oops .
63661	0	a	Yeah .
63662	0	a	Uh huh huh huh .
63663	0	a	On the desktop .
63664	0	a	I just tried that .
63665	0	a	My documents , computer .
63666	0	a	AMI .
63667	0	a	My compu oh here it is , yes .
63668	0	a	AMI should for
63669	0	a	Yeah .
63670	0	a	Okay , fine .
63671	0	a	Save .
63672	0	a	Okay good , so that is the good news .
63673	0	a	We going to be popular .
63674	0	a	So that
63675	0	a	I think financing was pretty simple .
63676	0	a	Now we would like to have a presentation by the marketing expert on production evaluation .
63677	1	a	Okay , I will take my file down so you can bring it up .
63678	0	a	Kay should be able to get it now .
63679	1	a	Kay , why do not you move just to the next slide right away .
63680	0	a	You want to go to the next slide ?
63681	1	a	Okay .
63682	0	a	Yeah right away .
63683	0	a	Okay , well obviously my method for s m
63684	0	a	the marketing of this thing is first to ask the big question , will it sell ?
63685	1	a	And I think we should show this prototype to people from various age and socio economic groups
63686	0	a	and see about any fine tuning that maybe little things we have not thought of .
63687	0	a	Okay .
63688	0	a	We ca not accept every suggestion of course ,
63689	1	a	but maybe we just need to get a few .
63690	0	a	Yeah .
63691	1	a	And show the the prototype to consumer research groups ,
63692	0	a	we do not s want somebody to suddenly come to us and tell us that this button is toxic and you know some child will swallow it
63693	0	a	and then we wo not sell any .
63694	0	a	So we have to get some input from those people .
63695	1	a	And then after that we just have to go with our best intuition
63696	0	a	and you know we like it
63697	0	a	, we think it is good , we are going to get behind it and sell it .
63698	1	a	, next slide please .
63699	0	a	Okay , now the things that I was thinking and th my wish list has really been realised in this prototype .
63700	0	a	I wanted the shape to be biomorphic , I did not want anything with angles and all square , I wanted it to be comfy and roundy
63701	0	a	so we we have got that .
63702	0	a	The size is small , the colour is bright and warm which is what we wanted .
63703	0	a	We wanted the feel to be as soft as possible , we will have the soft buttons and the way this is shaped , even though it is going to be hard plastic , it feels good in your hand
63704	0	a	so that is nice .
63705	0	a	And functionality I put last on my list because people are not going to use it before they buy it .
63706	0	a	So paradoxically the other features , in other words , the look , the feel and the shape , that is what people are going to get in the store .
63707	0	a	Fee selling .
63708	0	a	Yeah .
63709	0	a	They do not have a television in the store , they ca not play with it .
63710	0	a	Yeah .
63711	0	a	Yes .
63712	0	a	so they will be our main selling points .
63713	0	a	So
63714	0	a	th those have been fulfilled by your prototype
63715	1	a	and go ahead to the next slide please .
63716	0	a	Okay , so the shape I think is a a one .
63717	0	a	That is really , really excellent shape .
63718	0	a	The size is small
63719	0	a	and th these points are in the importance for the , for the marketing , these are not i in how I feel .
63720	0	a	I think that it is
63721	0	a	I think that it is plenty small enough to sell
63722	0	a	but I think we are sort of right
63723	0	a	the scale is one to seven .
63724	0	a	I think we are sort of right in the middle as far as c other competitors .
63725	0	a	Okay .
63726	0	a	And our colour I think is great .
63727	0	a	The colours are bright and warm and we really do great job there .
63728	0	a	And given the constraints that we had I think we got it as soft as possible .
63729	0	a	And then functionality I think you did a really good job on functionality ,
63730	0	a	obviously we could have ad added different functions but then we would disturb something else
63731	0	a	so I would say that we got to a five out of seven on on functionality .
63732	0	a	So I think that basically we have got a great product and we can get off and running with it .
63733	0	a	Okay .
63734	0	a	Yeah .
63735	0	a	I just realised one thing .
63736	0	a	Yes .
63737	0	a	In the financing there was no room for our voice recogniser .
63738	0	a	Yes .
63739	0	a	Yeah .
63740	0	a	And I do not know how we can evaluate that or how we can include that , too .
63741	0	a	Well , we had what , eight eight euros twenty as our cost ?
63742	0	a	And so we have got we have still got four euros to go to spend .
63743	0	a	Eight , eight twenty , yes .
63744	0	a	Eight twenty
63745	0	a	so
63746	0	a	We have four euros , yeah
63747	0	a	Yeah .
63748	0	a	I mean maximum
63749	0	a	we have another four point three euros
63750	0	a	I mean four thirty .
63751	0	a	Well that is
63752	0	a	But I mean we have no way of presenting that to management as you know as a f finished , as a finished product and saying okay with the voice recogniser that costs so much .
63753	1	a	So we just have to beware of that .
63754	1	a	I mean and know whether the four thirty will really cover that .
63755	0	a	Well as we know in today is technic technological world you can do just about anything at any price , the the the problem is quality .
63756	0	a	Yeah .
63757	0	a	Yeah .
63758	1	a	So we are just going to have to settle for whatever quality that will buy us .
63759	0	a	Yeah ,
63760	0	a	yeah .
63761	0	a	Yes , yes .
63762	0	a	And it may not be the greatest quality but it may sell anyway .
63763	0	a	Yeah , still .
63764	0	a	Yeah .
63765	0	a	As we have seen with so many of these kinds of products .
63766	0	a	Yeah .
63767	0	a	I am sorry to interrupt then
63768	0	a	but I just recog
63769	0	a	I just remembered that there was no that that was not included that there was no room for any special features ,
63770	0	a	okay ?
63771	1	a	So to beware of that .
63772	0	a	Included , yeah .
63773	0	a	Yeah , even my yeah , shape is one .
63774	0	a	Yeah .
63775	1	a	You want to go to this next slide , marketing expert ?
63776	0	a	I dunno .
63777	0	a	, well I is not this my last slide ?
63778	0	a	Maybe .
63779	1	a	Go ahead .
63780	0	a	Yes it is .
63781	0	a	I think that was my last slide , yeah .
63782	0	a	okay .
63783	0	a	And I am supposed to present this scale on the whiteboard .
63784	0	a	and we are supposed to talk about those things as a team now ,
63785	1	a	so if you put my last slide back up there .
63786	0	a	Oh .
63787	0	a	I am sorry
63788	0	a	I have forgot to do that , .
63789	0	a	Why ?
63790	0	a	Wh why you need that up ?
63791	0	a	I think you can make it there .
63792	0	a	Well because I ca not remember what I put on there .
63793	0	a	Okay .
63794	0	a	Now I am supposed to see how long my leash is here .
63795	0	a	kay .
63796	0	a	You ready .
63797	0	a	So now we are all supposed to say what we think .
63798	0	a	okay so on shape I gave it a one .
63799	0	a	Wait what would you ra
63800	0	a	one being good and seven being the worst .
63801	0	a	Worse , okay .
63802	0	a	what do you think the shape is ?
63803	0	a	One , okay ,
63804	0	a	and Be Betsy ?
63805	0	a	Okay , uh huh one , okay .
63806	0	a	One .
63807	0	a	Yes I think shape is one .
63808	0	a	And how about on size ?
63809	0	a	On size
63810	0	a	I gave it a four , yeah , I feel it is just average .
63811	0	a	You you gave it a four .
63812	0	a	, I dunno .
63813	0	a	I think I would give it at least a two .
63814	0	a	Okay .
63815	0	a	One .
63816	0	a	Yeah , even I think it is one .
63817	0	a	Okay .
63818	0	a	It is quite small .
63819	0	a	Okay you are the designer , of course you want to give it a one .
63820	0	a	and then how about how we doing on colour ?
63821	0	a	Colour , I gave it a one .
63822	0	a	Colour
63823	0	a	I
63824	0	a	One .
63825	0	a	I really like all those nice bright , warm colours .
63826	0	a	I I like the colours .
63827	0	a	One .
63828	0	a	One .
63829	0	a	One .
63830	0	a	Yes .
63831	0	a	Yeah , one .
63832	0	a	One , one , one , okay .
63833	0	a	And how about the feel ?
63834	0	a	Taking into consideration texture and comfort in the hand .
63835	0	a	, I think I would give it a two .
63836	0	a	Okay ,
63837	0	a	I gave it a three ,
63838	0	a	two ,
63839	0	a	yeah ?
63840	0	a	Three .
63841	0	a	I will give three .
63842	0	a	maybe two , yeah .
63843	0	a	Two , okay .
63844	0	a	And the next is functionality
63845	0	a	where I I admit I was a little hard on our team here , but
63846	0	a	Yeah .
63847	0	a	Well it is also you ca not really try it out the other things you have have more is are more tangible so from that point of view
63848	0	a	but
63849	0	a	I will give it a three .
63850	0	a	Okay .
63851	0	a	Two .
63852	0	a	Two , okay .
63853	0	a	three ,
63854	0	a	Three ?
63855	0	a	Okay .
63856	0	a	Well , .
63857	0	a	It looks like we have got got ourselves a pretty good product .
63858	1	a	the functionality is the only place where maybe we have to think about m m maybe , heaven forbid , having another meeting .
63859	0	a	Yeah .
63860	0	a	But otherwise I think we are we are ready to go to go with this product .
63861	0	a	Anybody else have any other comments or any other things that we feel we should evaluate ?
63862	0	a	Here is what we looking at satisfaction on for example room for creativity .
63863	0	a	Is there more room for creativity or are we absolutely happy ?
63864	0	a	Y al always bearing in mind that right now we are of course well within the budget
63865	0	a	and that we still you know we probably ca not , with this particular item , we probably ca not just add a whole lot of more things .
63866	0	a	Maybe we can
63867	1	a	yeah , include some more buttons and
63868	0	a	yeah features .
63869	0	a	We can always improve , yes .
63870	0	a	Yes , features .
63871	1	a	We can make the buttons few buttons smaller .
63872	0	a	I think they are quite big ,
63873	1	a	so I think
63874	1	a	I
63875	1	a	I mean we can just have small buttons and more buttons in that case .
63876	1	a	If we want to have more features than that .
63877	0	a	Well then again if we are going to do the speech recognition thing we are gon there going to be some buttons that are going to have to be added for that for the recording of the the speech .
63878	0	a	Yeah .
63879	0	a	Yeah , definitely .
63880	0	a	Yes .
63881	0	a	Voices .
63882	0	a	So that that is where we are going to have to do
63883	1	a	maybe we can eliminate one of the mute buttons , instead of having two mute buttons .
63884	0	a	Yeah , definitely , yeah
63885	0	a	, two mu mute buttons .
63886	0	a	Yes .
63887	0	a	Yes .
63888	1	a	And then maybe we can do something with the the volume control .
63889	1	a	Maybe we can put that all on one button .
63890	1	a	and a couple of other th maybe comp consolidate some of the usage an and see what we can do with that .
63891	0	a	And maybe
63892	0	a	Yes .
63893	0	a	No .
63894	1	a	we need you know we need to leave space money wise for the voice recogniser .
63895	0	a	Yeah .
63896	0	a	So th the question really is how do we feel with the project process ? , are we happy with the creativity that has passed here or we are not happy with the new product we created or that was created ?
63897	0	a	I think
63898	0	a	personally I think I am pretty happy .
63899	0	a	I am pretty happy with it too ,
63900	0	a	yeah , it is something I think I can market .
63901	0	a	Even I am happy .
63902	0	a	an
63903	0	a	and then the next question is are we happy with the leadership of this project ?
63904	0	a	And I think team work I think was very very good ,
63905	0	a	I think we really
63906	0	a	yeah .
63907	0	a	Yeah .
63908	0	a	Yeah .
63909	0	a	I think you have done a good job , Miss leader .
63910	0	a	Yes , yes you have done a good job .
63911	0	a	Yeah , yeah , definitely .
63912	0	a	Yeah I d I do too
63913	0	a	I think we worked well together as a team , yeah .
63914	0	a	Yeah .
63915	0	a	Yeah .
63916	0	a	And I think we
63917	0	a	are we happy with the means we used ?
63918	0	a	We used whiteboard , we did not use digital p well digital pens
63919	0	a	I guess are these things .
63920	0	a	Yeah maybe we could have used the whiteboard a little bit more , yeah
63921	0	a	, we did not use that enough .
63922	0	a	Whiteboard more , yes , yes .
63923	0	a	Yeah , probably .
63924	0	a	Yes , we could .
63925	0	a	, it is maybe not in the best position in the room you know like sometimes it is positioned so that it is much better visible for everybody
63926	0	a	and I think from that point of view we sort of ignored it a little bit .
63927	0	a	And we used the slide because it was better positioned .
63928	0	a	Yes .
63929	0	a	Yes , I think so , I think absolutely , and fortunately we all had slides presentation which made it a little easier .
63930	0	a	Yeah .
63931	0	a	No .
63932	0	a	I think that is true .
63933	0	a	Yes .
63934	0	a	did we new
63935	0	a	did we find new ideas ?
63936	0	a	I think we did .
63937	0	a	Yeah , many .
63938	0	a	I think we were we were very good , yeah , .
63939	0	a	I think we we did , in more than one respect
63940	0	a	and so I think we did very well here .
63941	0	a	Okay .
63942	0	a	Are the costs within budget ?
63943	0	a	Yes , yes .
63944	0	a	is the project evaluated ?
63945	0	a	Yes .
63946	0	a	Yes , yes .
63947	0	a	Yeah .
63948	0	a	then celebration .
63949	0	a	Celebration .
63950	0	a	Cel celebration yes , yes .
63951	0	a	Today we have apple juice and after we sell m million of them we have champagne .
63952	0	a	So I I thank you all very much .
63953	0	a	, I think this was very good
63954	0	a	and
63955	0	a	I think we did come up with a new product that is feasible .
63956	0	a	Yeah .
63957	0	a	Feasible from the production point of view and feasible from a marketing point of view .
63958	0	a	So , thank you .
63959	0	a	Okay .
63960	0	a	Yeah .
63961	0	a	Thank you .
63962	0	a	Thank you very much .
63963	0	a	Okay .
63964	0	a	Watch I
63965	0	a	I have my cord behind you here .
63966	0	a	Okay .
63967	0	a	Okay .
63968	0	a	I always get it on here , but getting it off is yes we have time later
63969	0	a	Do we do we have some time left ?
63970	0	a	you have
63971	0	a	They say it is forty minutes .
63972	0	a	But we we were told we could end the final meeting at any time , whenever we felt we were finished .
63973	0	a	It will take me the rest of the time to get my microphone out from my necklace .
63974	0	a	 
63975	0	a	So
63976	0	a	good morning .
63977	0	a	Morning .
63978	0	a	Morning .
63979	0	a	Morning .
63980	0	a	I see you all find your places .
63981	0	a	Is everybody sitting on the right place ?
63982	0	a	Yeah ?
63983	0	a	I guess so .
63984	0	a	Yep .
63985	0	a	So Let is see .
63986	1	a	First I will introduce myself .
63987	0	a	I do not know if if everybody knows me ,
63988	0	a	so
63989	0	a	I am Bart ,
63990	0	a	hello .
63991	0	a	My name is Frank .
63992	0	a	Hello .
63993	0	a	I am .
63994	0	a	Bart .
63995	0	a	Hello .
63996	0	a	Hello .
63997	0	a	Bart .
63998	0	a	Welcome .
63999	0	a	Thank you .
64000	0	a	let is see .
64001	1	a	let is start off with a little presentation .
64002	1	a	Now first I will tell you a little bit about the setting .
64003	0	a	You can see there are a few cameras here .
64004	0	a	They will record our actions and you will have wires and microphones that will record your voice .
64005	0	a	there are also some microphones there
64006	1	a	but th you do not have to pay a lot of attention on those ,
64007	0	a	because it will disappear when you do not attend to it .
64008	0	a	So
64009	0	a	is there a project documents folder ?
64010	0	a	There are some notes in it already I see , some documents .
64011	1	a	I will start with the presentation kick off .
64012	0	a	Is being modified by the administrator .
64013	0	a	okay .
64014	0	a	, that is interesting .
64015	1	a	Let is do it read only .
64016	0	a	Well
64017	0	a	I do not know if you have noticed , but we are working for Real Reaction .
64018	0	a	it is a company in electronics .
64019	0	a	We put fashion in electronics , we make it work , we put a lot of effort in design and in the product itself .
64020	0	a	I am Bart the project manager so I will direct you through the project .
64021	0	a	This is our agenda .
64022	0	a	we have our opening acquaintance , tool training , project plan description closing .
64023	1	a	maybe I can sit down , then I can take some notes
64024	0	a	or
64025	0	a	Let is see .
64026	1	a	Maybe you can take the minutes once in a while .
64027	0	a	Sure .
64028	0	a	I dunno it is not a lot of work ,
64029	1	a	but just if you hear something you can write down , just write it down .
64030	0	a	as you can see it is the opening , aquaintance tool training .
64031	0	a	Aquaintance is a point we have done a bit .
64032	0	a	have you all seen the corporate website already ?
64033	0	a	Yeah .
64034	0	a	Yep .
64035	0	a	Yep .
64036	0	a	Visit it .
64037	0	a	Have you seen any flaws in it ?
64038	0	a	I think I found one .
64039	0	a	No ?
64040	1	a	I can see if it works this way .
64041	0	a	Okay .
64042	0	a	Ca not say I paid much attention to it ,
64043	0	a	Oh yeah .
64044	0	a	No , it does not work here .
64045	0	a	Okay no problem .
64046	0	a	But on the corporate information side there is a th there was Real Remote instead of Real Reaction .
64047	0	a	Real Remote is not really the company we are we are , but it is just a little fault .
64048	0	a	Yeah .
64049	0	a	okay ,
64050	0	a	what are we going to do ?
64051	0	a	our project aim is as you can see a new remote control .
64052	0	a	It has to be original , trendy , and user friendly .
64053	0	a	So these are the points why we also hired you .
64054	0	a	We have got the Marketing Expert for the trendy and user friendly look .
64055	0	a	Okay .
64056	0	a	And Industrial Designer there is also user friendly and a bit original .
64057	0	a	And we have got our User Interface Designer .
64058	0	a	Yep .
64059	0	a	He is also
64060	0	a	That is about the new remote control .
64061	0	a	project method is there are three phases we are going through .
64062	0	a	First is functional des design , individual work , meetings .
64063	0	a	After the functional design , then the conceptual design and the detailed design .
64064	0	a	I had some role indications on here .
64065	0	a	But I think you know it already by yourself .
64066	0	a	The Industrial Designer is going to work on the working design , components design and a bit of the look and feel design .
64067	0	a	the User Interface Designer is going to do the technical function design , user interface concept and user interface design .
64068	0	a	And the marketing expert is doing a little bit of user requirement specification , trend watching and project product ev evaluation .
64069	0	a	So that is a bit what you are going to do .
64070	0	a	But that will be all worked out in other meetings .
64071	0	a	Then we have got our first tool training .
64072	0	a	We are going to work with a lot of high tech tools here ,
64073	0	a	so it is ab it is handy if we have a little bit of training first .
64074	0	a	As you can see we have got the smart boards here and here in the white board .
64075	0	a	in the white board here there is a little tool bar on this side .
64076	0	a	Here are some functions .
64077	0	a	You can save .
64078	0	a	N
64079	0	a	these functions we do not have anything to do with , only undo , you can undo a little piece of drawing .
64080	0	a	A blank new document for each person .
64081	0	a	select a pen , eraser .
64082	0	a	Capture we do not have to do anything with .
64083	0	a	then we have got our pen .
64084	0	a	This pen .
64085	0	a	It is really funny
64086	0	a	because you can draw with it on this page in the think it is form of .
64087	0	a	Kay .
64088	0	a	You can also select the current colour and the line width .
64089	0	a	But then first you have to select the pen function .
64090	1	a	But we are going to work with it in a minute .
64091	0	a	So okay .
64092	0	a	that is very simple and it is easy to draw your findings and drawings on there .
64093	1	a	then a short thing about documents .
64094	0	a	We have got our shared folder ,
64095	0	a	project project
64096	0	a	what was it ?
64097	0	a	Project documents I think .
64098	0	a	But all you will found that already because there are a lot of documents in it already ,
64099	0	a	so it will be okay .
64100	0	a	And these are available on the smart boards as well , so if you have a document you want to show , just open it from the folder .
64101	0	a	Okay .
64102	0	a	Yeah .
64103	0	a	Here is a simple tool bar .
64104	0	a	It is what I just said , it is save , print , move back or forward one page .
64105	0	a	You can switch between the different drawings .
64106	1	a	And then we are going to try out the white board .
64107	0	a	So
64108	0	a	as you can see we g all going to draw a animal .
64109	0	a	Just to just to get a bit familiar with it .
64110	0	a	Mouse was not running away .
64111	0	a	That was interesting .
64112	0	a	Is everybody is anybody playing with the mouse ?
64113	0	a	No .
64114	0	a	Okay .
64115	0	a	Innocent .
64116	0	a	We are going to draw animal .
64117	0	a	And just sum up a few of its favourite characteristics .
64118	1	a	the only thing we have to look after is that we use different colours , and different line width .
64119	0	a	there is
64120	1	a	I can start from now .
64121	1	a	I will .
64122	1	a	You can use this pen by holding it like a like a little child .
64123	0	a	Because if you hold it like this , the sensors will get blocked and then the drawing wo not get good .
64124	0	a	Okay .
64125	0	a	Kay .
64126	1	a	Another thing is you have to be a bit slow .
64127	0	a	Cause if you are going to draw like really fast then the pen wo not hold up .
64128	0	a	So
64129	1	a	we choose form of current colour
64130	0	a	I think grey is appropriate .
64131	1	a	Then the line width .
64132	0	a	I think seven will be nice .
64133	0	a	Now you will see my drawing capabilities .
64134	0	a	These are not very much ,
64135	0	a	but
64136	0	a	, see
64137	1	a	you have to do it real slow .
64138	0	a	Oh
64139	0	a	I was trying to draw a dolphin , but I think his nose has to be a little bit
64140	0	a	But it is close .
64141	0	a	Sure .
64142	0	a	I am thinking about a swordfish .
64143	0	a	So what
64144	0	a	yeah
64145	0	a	it is this is bit of the swordfish .
64146	0	a	Yeah .
64147	0	a	Yeah .
64148	0	a	Yeah ,
64149	0	a	he has not got an eye .
64150	0	a	Woah .
64151	1	a	Now we have got another function .
64152	1	a	We have got the eraser .
64153	0	a	And then you can undo this easily .
64154	0	a	Meat .
64155	0	a	it is okay .
64156	0	a	And I have got to write down a few of its characteristics .
64157	0	a	is
64158	0	a	They have got no text tool , no .
64159	0	a	Okay .
64160	0	a	This is typically a undo action , I think .
64161	0	a	Yeah .
64162	0	a	Pen .
64163	0	a	Maybe you have to hold it a bit upside down .
64164	0	a	I think that is it
64165	0	a	because if you wan ar are going to do it like this then it will be a stripe .
64166	0	a	But I do not know ,
64167	0	a	I am just trying .
64168	0	a	This is not my work ,
64169	0	a	okay .
64170	0	a	Maybe you have to use
64171	0	a	Oh .
64172	0	a	I think it is a
64173	0	a	it wants to draw a another animal ?
64174	0	a	I do not know .
64175	0	a	It lives for the fun .
64176	0	a	So
64177	0	a	It is my characteristic characteristic about the dolphin .
64178	0	a	It lives for the fun .
64179	0	a	Okay .
64180	0	a	So
64181	1	a	now I am going to hand over the pen on the new blank sheet to you .
64182	0	a	Okay .
64183	1	a	Go ahead .
64184	0	a	Thank you .
64185	0	a	Okay .
64186	1	a	Gonna use a different line width .
64187	1	a	And I am going to draw in black .
64188	0	a	There .
64189	0	a	Kay ,
64190	0	a	I am not much of an artist ,
64191	1	a	but here we go .
64192	0	a	Maybe it is easier to draw the smaller line width , I think .
64193	0	a	Because this is going a lot better than I did .
64194	0	a	A sheep .
64195	0	a	Okay .
64196	0	a	This is my .
64197	0	a	Sheep .
64198	0	a	It is nice .
64199	0	a	With of course little blue dot they always get sprayed on their butts .
64200	0	a	It is a real dead sheep ,
64201	0	a	yeah .
64202	0	a	There .
64203	0	a	Yeah .
64204	0	a	For recognition ,
64205	0	a	yeah , I see .
64206	1	a	maybe you can also write your name somewhere .
64207	0	a	Kay .
64208	0	a	On just a
64209	0	a	Yeah .
64210	0	a	They are
64211	0	a	Come on .
64212	0	a	You have to go really slow when you are writing .
64213	0	a	They are brilliant animal animals .
64214	0	a	And that is just a little me thingy .
64215	0	a	So .
64216	1	a	Guess I will pass the pen to our User Interface Designer .
64217	0	a	Okay .
64218	0	a	Nice .
64219	1	a	I am just going to draw its head ,
64220	0	a	but
64221	0	a	Let is see .
64222	0	a	Okay .
64223	0	a	Interesting .
64224	0	a	Sweet .
64225	0	a	Yeah .
64226	0	a	You know what that is ?
64227	0	a	Or who ?
64228	0	a	okay ,
64229	0	a	yeah .
64230	0	a	A rabbit ?
64231	0	a	Garfield .
64232	0	a	Garfield .
64233	0	a	Yeah .
64234	0	a	Just a
64235	0	a	Guess .
64236	0	a	So
64237	0	a	Yeah .
64238	0	a	That is enough .
64239	0	a	, you say a blank ,
64240	0	a	or
64241	0	a	Okay .
64242	0	a	Yeah , just a blank sheet .
64243	0	a	Well
64244	0	a	I was going to draw a cat too ,
64245	0	a	so .
64246	1	a	I will just try something else .
64247	0	a	No .
64248	1	a	Something different than Garfield .
64249	0	a	Mine is a bit more skinny .
64250	0	a	Yeah ,
64251	0	a	it is pretty skinny cat .
64252	0	a	Yeah .
64253	0	a	But
64254	0	a	Well ,
64255	0	a	it is supposed to be a cat .
64256	0	a	And the most interesting tail .
64257	0	a	Is your cat , or did you find him on the street ?
64258	0	a	I like cats
64259	0	a	because they are independent .
64260	0	a	The pen .
64261	0	a	So .
64262	0	a	Okay .
64263	0	a	That is pretty clear .
64264	0	a	So
64265	0	a	everybody knows how to work with the white board now ?
64266	0	a	So
64267	1	a	if you have any ideas or if you want to draw anything on the white board , just ask and go ahead .
64268	0	a	Yeah .
64269	0	a	The pen .
64270	0	a	It is pretty easy .
64271	0	a	Kay .
64272	0	a	S
64273	0	a	haunted white board .
64274	0	a	We are being haunted .
64275	0	a	So
64276	0	a	we have got the tool introduction .
64277	1	a	We move along to the project finance .
64278	0	a	as you can see , we for our remote control , a selling price is twenty five Euros .
64279	0	a	Our selling price .
64280	0	a	our profit aim is fifty million Euros .
64281	0	a	that is the least we have to get from our remote controls ,
64282	1	a	so we have to work together to reach our aims .
64283	0	a	we can do it international ,
64284	1	a	so we have to focus on different kind of users , different kind of cultures , and different kind of trends as well .
64285	0	a	but that is all in the later stadium .
64286	0	a	Our production cost can be maximal twelve and a half Euros ,
64287	1	a	so that is also a point we have to keep in mind , that we wo not make remote controls with small televisions inside , and stuff like that .
64288	0	a	It wo not work .
64289	0	a	So
64290	0	a	just try to remember these points .
64291	0	a	Selling price twenty five , profit aims fifty million , but more important is the int international market we are trying to focus on .
64292	0	a	And production cost maximal twelve and a half Euros .
64293	0	a	So
64294	1	a	that is leads us to our little discussion .
64295	0	a	We have got about five or ten minutes left for discussion .
64296	0	a	So
64297	1	a	I am going to sit down , I think .
64298	0	a	It is easier .
64299	0	a	Yeah ,
64300	0	a	you got a message .
64301	0	a	I have got a message .
64302	0	a	Five minutes .
64303	0	a	Five minutes , okay .
64304	0	a	Okay , that is good timing .
64305	0	a	So
64306	0	a	just on a side note , why is it my laptop is only giving me a black screen ?
64307	0	a	Yeah .
64308	0	a	maybe you have to say the magic word .
64309	0	a	Right .
64310	0	a	Does it do anything ?
64311	1	a	Maybe you have to just clap it down ?
64312	1	a	back up again .
64313	0	a	No .
64314	0	a	No slide show .
64315	0	a	It is off now .
64316	0	a	It is off .
64317	1	a	Now you have to put it back o
64318	0	a	Oh yeah .
64319	0	a	You will be okay , I think .
64320	0	a	Well ,
64321	0	a	it was on ,
64322	0	a	but
64323	0	a	there we are .
64324	0	a	Well
64325	0	a	it is those laptops .
64326	0	a	Nice .
64327	0	a	Okay .
64328	0	a	But so
64329	0	a	does everybody has experiences with remote controls , and I mean not the ordinary mote controls , but also a little bit different ones ?
64330	0	a	Like you can use for other ?
64331	0	a	No ?
64332	0	a	You ?
64333	0	a	yeah .
64334	0	a	Oh really ?
64335	0	a	Huh .
64336	0	a	Well ,
64337	0	a	we have a kind of broad TV at home , and a DVD player , so we got like a lot of remote controls , one for the TV , one for the video recorder , one for the DVD player .
64338	0	a	No , me neither .
64339	0	a	It is a
64340	0	a	Sure .
64341	1	a	And I think it is it would be best to just make one remote control that can operate them all .
64342	0	a	Yep .
64343	0	a	Yeah
64344	0	a	I have I have got one at home .
64345	0	a	Yeah .
64346	0	a	And you can program
64347	0	a	I think eight different devices in it , and you can use it for your television , anything else .
64348	0	a	Okay , yeah .
64349	0	a	Yeah .
64350	0	a	And it also operates on infra red , so you have to got the little device inside your room , and then you can operate it from the third or th or second floor .
64351	0	a	Okay , yeah .
64352	0	a	Oh
64353	0	a	really .
64354	0	a	So that is pretty handy when you have a video recorder or DVD player downstairs
64355	0	a	and you have got a link to your TV on the second floor .
64356	0	a	Oh .
64357	0	a	Yeah .
64358	0	a	So that is a pretty handy thing .
64359	0	a	but only the
64360	0	a	I think that if you can put different kind of devices in one remote control , it makes it a lot easier as well .
64361	0	a	It is
64362	0	a	That is good to remember .
64363	0	a	Yeah .
64364	0	a	Oh .
64365	0	a	So
64366	1	a	I think you can take minutes again .
64367	0	a	Yeah ,
64368	0	a	that is nice , I think .
64369	0	a	Since it is your job .
64370	0	a	So
64371	1	a	we have we want different functions and we can maybe see if we can do something with the infra red .
64372	0	a	Yeah .
64373	0	a	But I do not know if that will exceed the production costs .
64374	1	a	So that that is something we have to find out , I think .
64375	0	a	Yeah .
64376	0	a	But that would be really good if we could do that .
64377	1	a	And other functions for a remote control ?
64378	0	a	Maybe we can make it
64379	0	a	Shock proof .
64380	1	a	Think it has to be shock proof
64381	0	a	cause my remote control tends to fall a lot .
64382	0	a	Sure , yeah .
64383	1	a	Waterproof ,
64384	0	a	or
64385	0	a	, you never no know ,
64386	0	a	I w I mean
64387	0	a	Kay .
64388	0	a	So
64389	0	a	Yeah ,
64390	1	a	one other little thing .
64391	0	a	Sure .
64392	0	a	Waterproof .
64393	0	a	Okay .
64394	0	a	So
64395	0	a	these are our a few things we can think of .
64396	1	a	I will put the minutes from this meeting in our project folder .
64397	1	a	Thought it might be handy to put a battery status display on it .
64398	0	a	So you can see how much is left in the battery .
64399	0	a	That is a
64400	0	a	battery stays .
64401	0	a	Okay , yeah .
64402	0	a	But they will also really drag up the production costs ,
64403	1	a	so think we will have to see about that too .
64404	0	a	Yeah .
64405	1	a	But maybe just a little LED ,
64406	0	a	I do not know .
64407	0	a	That is an idea as well .
64408	1	a	Other ideas ?
64409	1	a	Quick ideas .
64410	0	a	Nope .
64411	0	a	They were all mentioned ,
64412	0	a	so
64413	0	a	Okay .
64414	0	a	Yeah .
64415	0	a	Any questions about this presentation ?
64416	0	a	Kick off presentation .
64417	0	a	Nope , do not think so .
64418	0	a	No ?
64419	0	a	Okay ,
64420	1	a	then I will put the minutes from this meeting in the project folder ,
64421	1	a	and then we can all work .
64422	0	a	Finish meeting now .
64423	0	a	Okay .
64424	0	a	Okay .
64425	1	a	And we can all work on our own projects .
64426	0	a	Aye sir .
64427	0	a	Okay
64428	0	a	then I will meet you in about a half an hour , I think .
64429	0	a	Half an hour .
64430	0	a	Okay .
64431	0	a	 
64432	0	a	Okay .
64433	0	a	Everybody found his place again ?
64434	0	a	Yeah ?
64435	0	a	That is nice .
64436	0	a	Yes .
64437	0	a	Okay so
64438	0	a	this is our second meeting .
64439	0	a	And
64440	0	a	still failing ?
64441	0	a	now we are going into the functional design .
64442	0	a	Yeah .
64443	0	a	important thing of this phase is that we are going to try to get an agreement about the user requirements , technical function design , and the working design .
64444	0	a	So that we can move onto the second phase .
64445	1	a	But first this phase .
64446	1	a	first an announcement .
64447	0	a	There is a little adaptation in the air conditioning system .
64448	0	a	So
64449	0	a	There is our ghost mouse again .
64450	0	a	That that means that you can have a little trouble with , little trouble with the air conditioning ,
64451	0	a	that is because of this
64452	0	a	It is in wing C and E .
64453	0	a	Okay .
64454	0	a	Okay .
64455	0	a	So
64456	0	a	it should be over in a in a while , couple of days .
64457	0	a	But it is going to be cold anyway ,
64458	0	a	so I do not think you are going to need it .
64459	0	a	No .
64460	0	a	Then our agenda .
64461	0	a	Now
64462	0	a	first the opening .
64463	1	a	this time I will take the minutes .
64464	0	a	you are going to have a presentation .
64465	0	a	All of you .
64466	0	a	and we have got forty minutes for the whole prese for the whole presentations .
64467	1	a	So I suggest we take about seven minutes per presentation ,
64468	0	a	and then we can have a little discussion about the new project requirements which have been sent to me .
64469	0	a	And then the decision on the control functions which we want to include and those which we do not want to include .
64470	0	a	So
64471	0	a	we have got forty minutes for all of it .
64472	0	a	So
64473	1	a	I suggest let is start with the first presentation .
64474	0	a	Yes .
64475	1	a	who wants to be first ?
64476	0	a	Okay .
64477	1	a	Think I will go first .
64478	0	a	So
64479	0	a	Just maybe it is easier if you
64480	0	a	Yeah
64481	1	a	I think you will tell your presentation as well .
64482	1	a	Just which function you have and what you are going to talk about .
64483	0	a	Kay .
64484	0	a	My name is Freek Van Ponnen .
64485	0	a	I am the Market Expert .
64486	0	a	But you already knew that .
64487	0	a	I have done some research .
64488	0	a	We have we have been doing research in a usability lab where we observed users operating remote controls .
64489	0	a	we let them fill out a questionnaire .
64490	0	a	We had one hundred of these test subjects .
64491	0	a	in addition we did some market research .
64492	0	a	see what the market consists of .
64493	0	a	What ages are involved .
64494	0	a	Well
64495	0	a	these are three quite astonishing results , I thought .
64496	0	a	remotes are being considered ugly .
64497	0	a	F
64498	0	a	seventy five percent of the people questioned indicated that they thought their remote were was ugly .
64499	0	a	and an additional eighty percent indicated that they would spend more money on a fancy looking remote control .
64500	0	a	So
64501	0	a	in addition remotes were not very functional .
64502	0	a	Fifty percent of the people indicated they only loo used about ten percent of the buttons on a remote control .
64503	0	a	And fifty percent of the people indicated that their remote tended to get lost in their room .
64504	0	a	So
64505	0	a	some things .
64506	0	a	Then we did some research to the most relevant functions .
64507	0	a	Channel selection and volume selection both got a ten on a scale of one to ten for relevancy .
64508	0	a	The power button got a nine .
64509	0	a	And teletext got a six and a half .
64510	0	a	So these are the most most important functions on a remote control .
64511	0	a	Then there are some one time use function .
64512	0	a	That is what I like to call them .
64513	0	a	That audio settings , video settings , and channel settings buttons .
64514	0	a	Which are not really used very frequently , but are still considered to be of some importance .
64515	0	a	channel selection was also indicated to be used very frequently .
64516	0	a	One hundred and sixty eight times per hour .
64517	0	a	Then these are the
64518	0	a	This is the market .
64519	0	a	sixty percent of the market consists of users between the ages
64520	0	a	sixteen and forty
64521	0	a	f six .
64522	0	a	Main characteristic of this group is that they are very critical on the remote control .
64523	0	a	they like to use new f new functions .
64524	0	a	But they also are very critical .
64525	0	a	They wo not spend their money very easily .
64526	0	a	So
64527	0	a	the users of forty six to sixty five years cons
64528	0	a	The make up forty percent of the market .
64529	0	a	They are not really very interested in features .
64530	0	a	But they do tend to spend their money a lot easier .
64531	1	a	What I think this indicates for our design .
64532	1	a	I think we should make a remote for the future .
64533	1	a	And this means we would have to focus on the age ages sixteen to forty five .
64534	0	a	this also makes up most the biggest part of the market , so that will also be where our main profit would be gettable .
64535	1	a	this would mean we would have to make a fancy design .
64536	0	a	The results also indicated that about one quarter of the people questioned thought that the remote control caused RS RSI .
64537	1	a	this is certainly something to take into account .
64538	0	a	And thirty four percent thought that it was hard to learn a n how to operate a new control , remote control .
64539	1	a	So these are two factors that I think should be included in the design .
64540	1	a	Besides of course that the remote must look very nice .
64541	0	a	And the functionality As a lot of people indicated , they only use about ten percent of the buttons ,
64542	1	a	I think we should make very few buttons .
64543	0	a	this will also be beneficial to the design of the remote .
64544	1	a	I think the most frequently used buttons should be emphasised .
64545	1	a	Especially the channel selection and audio selection buttons .
64546	0	a	Cause they are used most
64547	1	a	and so they should be robust .
64548	1	a	They should not break down easily .
64549	0	a	Then as mo as a lot of people indicated that their remote got lost in the room ,
64550	0	a	it might be
64551	0	a	and I say might be
64552	0	a	because it would certainly boost the production costs a lot .
64553	1	a	But it might be a good idea to make a docking station .
64554	1	a	And this would , could get a button in it which would send a signal to the remote which would then beep .
64555	0	a	So you would know where it is in the room .
64556	1	a	And in addition to this it could recharge the batteries in the remote if you put it in .
64557	0	a	Then a surprisingly great deal of people w indicated that an LCD screen in the remote control would be preferred .
64558	0	a	This was mostly people in the age of sixteen to twenty five .
64559	0	a	But up till forty five it remains feasible .
64560	0	a	This would also greatly increase the production costs
64561	1	a	but I think these are just some small factors we could consider .
64562	0	a	Okay .
64563	0	a	That would be all .
64564	0	a	Thank you .
64565	0	a	So
64566	0	a	anybody have any questions until now ?
64567	0	a	About functional requirements ?
64568	0	a	Okay
64569	0	a	that is clear .
64570	0	a	Any questions ?
64571	0	a	Kay .
64572	0	a	No .
64573	1	a	Now to the second .
64574	0	a	okay .
64575	0	a	I have been looking at the user interface of it .
64576	0	a	Yeah .
64577	0	a	f for the techno f functions of of it .
64578	0	a	Okay .
64579	0	a	Yeah
64580	1	a	you can take your time .
64581	0	a	We have got plenty of time ,
64582	0	a	so
64583	0	a	Yeah .
64584	0	a	Oh .
64585	0	a	Yeah
64586	1	a	you should go to the top thingy .
64587	1	a	Slide show .
64588	0	a	Oh yeah .
64589	0	a	Okay .
64590	0	a	There it is .
64591	0	a	Yeah .
64592	0	a	yeah .
64593	1	a	I think we must use the general functions of the remote control .
64594	0	a	I have do I have done a little research on the internet and not much information about it , about interface
64595	0	a	but Yeah
64596	0	a	I I have been thinking about a simple manner to put a lot of functions in one in one remote control .
64597	0	a	so you have got a lot of devi devices like DVD television , stereo .
64598	0	a	So
64599	0	a	But it must be user friendly .
64600	0	a	So
64601	1	a	you c you ca not put a a lot of functions in one
64602	1	a	Yeah .
64603	1	a	Yeah .
64604	1	a	In one remote control .
64605	0	a	One remote .
64606	0	a	But Yeah .
64607	0	a	yeah .
64608	0	a	Got many functions in one remote control ,
64609	0	a	but yeah
64610	0	a	you can see , this is quite simple remote control .
64611	0	a	few buttons but
64612	0	a	This re remote control got a a lot of buttons .
64613	0	a	people do not like it ,
64614	0	a	so Well
64615	1	a	what I was thinking about was keep the general functions like they are .
64616	0	a	So
64617	1	a	like the on off button .
64618	1	a	keep it
64619	1	a	yeah
64620	1	a	l like a red button .
64621	0	a	everybody everybody knows it
64622	1	a	so you do not have to change that .
64623	0	a	My personal preferences .
64624	1	a	Use a display for specific functions of the different device .
64625	0	a	So
64626	0	a	Wh what I was th thinking about was
64627	0	a	you have got this the remote control
64628	1	a	and you got here the general functions , like the on off button sound
64629	1	a	I dunno
64630	1	a	And here you have got a s kind of a display .
64631	1	a	It is a touchscreen .
64632	0	a	So yeah
64633	1	a	you got a general
64634	1	a	f f the functions of the device for a DVD player or so the pl
64635	1	a	yeah
64636	1	a	f for playing reverse .
64637	1	a	And you got here real buttons for selecting a device .
64638	0	a	So
64639	1	a	this button is for a DVD
64640	0	a	or
64641	0	a	So
64642	0	a	for every device you have got a a f a b a part display of a part buttons .
64643	0	a	So
64644	0	a	you you never got all the buttons on w one device .
64645	0	a	So
64646	0	a	that is my idea about it .
64647	0	a	Kay .
64648	0	a	yeah and let is see .
64649	0	a	yeah .
64650	0	a	So
64651	1	a	a touchscreen .
64652	0	a	and th the buttons the real buttons we have to use .
64653	1	a	We better c use quite large buttons
64654	0	a	for
64655	0	a	yeah .
64656	0	a	Everybody have to use it so ol even even old people young people .
64657	0	a	So
64658	1	a	we must keep buttons quite s simple and quite large .
64659	0	a	So Yeah .
64660	0	a	Yeah .
64661	0	a	yeah .
64662	0	a	That was my part of it .
64663	0	a	Okay .
64664	0	a	So
64665	0	a	N I
64666	0	a	I do not think so .
64667	0	a	Anybody has questions about the technical functions ?
64668	0	a	Yeah .
64669	0	a	Well
64670	0	a	I think if we are going to use a touchscreen we are going to go way above the twelve and a half Euros .
64671	1	a	you got quite a cheap touchscreen .
64672	0	a	Touchscreen .
64673	1	a	S it is not in colour or something .
64674	0	a	it is just one colo
64675	0	a	yeah .
64676	0	a	I seen w something on the internet not today but a few weeks ago .
64677	0	a	you got
64678	0	a	yeah
64679	0	a	quite an a kind of touchscreen
64680	0	a	and it is for twenty Euros or less .
64681	0	a	Huh .
64682	0	a	So it is possible .
64683	0	a	Kay .
64684	0	a	That is nice .
64685	0	a	Well
64686	0	a	it would certainly make a fancy design .
64687	0	a	Yeah .
64688	0	a	Yeah .
64689	0	a	But the It would not be very robust .
64690	0	a	So
64691	0	a	That is true .
64692	0	a	It is very fragile and you can get scratches on it .
64693	0	a	That is right .
64694	0	a	Yeah that is true .
64695	1	a	We would have to look into that .
64696	0	a	maybe we can first listen to your presentation ?
64697	1	a	And then we have a little discussion about the requirements and design .
64698	0	a	Yeah .
64699	0	a	That is .
64700	0	a	Okay .
64701	0	a	I think it is going to
64702	0	a	it is not too much .
64703	0	a	Okay .
64704	0	a	Okay
64705	1	a	I have got a presentation about the working design .
64706	1	a	first about how it works .
64707	0	a	It is really simple of course .
64708	0	a	Everybody knows how a remote works .
64709	0	a	The user presses a button .
64710	0	a	The remote determines what button it is , uses the infrared to send a signal to the TV .
64711	0	a	The TV switches to the frequency , or what function it is .
64712	0	a	So
64713	0	a	we have got the the plate .
64714	0	a	It gots conductive disks for every button .
64715	0	a	When the user presses a button , a signal got sent , goes to the LED and transmits tranmi transmits its to the TV .
64716	0	a	It is a very simple device , technically speaking .
64717	0	a	So
64718	0	a	this is a schematic overview .
64719	0	a	You have got the buttons .
64720	0	a	The power source .
64721	0	a	And when a button gets pressed , its goes to the chip .
64722	0	a	The chip controls the infrared bulb and perf perhaps a normal bulb .
64723	0	a	When you press a button you can actually see your pressed button .
64724	0	a	Well
64725	1	a	I think we should use default materials , simple plastics .
64726	1	a	Keep the inner workings simple ,
64727	0	a	so it is robust .
64728	1	a	I think we should focus on aesthetics , the design and the user interface ,
64729	0	a	because if you are going to use high tech materials the price is going to go sky high .
64730	0	a	And you only have to design a remote once , and if you use high tech materials it come back in every product .
64731	0	a	So
64732	0	a	it is , in my idea , it is it is going to be smart to invest in di in design and not in in the product itself .
64733	0	a	That is it .
64734	0	a	Okay .
64735	0	a	Thank you .
64736	0	a	Okay .
64737	0	a	Okay
64738	0	a	now I hope everybody has a little bit more insight in the functions we all have and what we are doing right now .
64739	0	a	I am the Project Manager
64740	1	a	so I am here to mess things up and tell you some new requirements .
64741	0	a	that is ,
64742	0	a	we have got to design a remote which is only suitable for TV .
64743	0	a	that is because it will be too complex and the time to market will be too big , if we want to have it for more functions .
64744	0	a	Okay .
64745	0	a	So it has to be simple .
64746	0	a	another point is we have to skip the teletext , because in the world of upcoming internet we think teletext is going to be a thing of the past .
64747	0	a	And it is a function we do not need in our remote control .
64748	1	a	internet is also mentioned in a function we can use .
64749	0	a	maybe also on televisions it will be available as well .
64750	0	a	Another one is the customer is forty plus .
64751	0	a	that is the the market we have to to to target , because we are going to develop a new product which is specially designed for the younger customers .
64752	0	a	this is a bit pity for the Marketing Expert .
64753	0	a	Because he was aiming on the the younger persons .
64754	0	a	So we have to find a market which is above forty plus but which will suit our remote control , and the other way round .
64755	0	a	And we have to be very attent in putting the corporate image in our product .
64756	0	a	So it has to be visible in our design , in the way our device works .
64757	0	a	And we have to be very clear on this point as well .
64758	0	a	So
64759	1	a	I suggest let is have a discussion on the control functions .
64760	0	a	Yeah .
64761	0	a	So
64762	0	a	is there any discussion possible about the new product requirement ?
64763	0	a	Yeah
64764	0	a	cause you are you are saying that teletext is going to be an old feature and it is not going to be used anymore anyway pretty soon .
64765	1	a	we can see if we can find a way between the functions we want to use and the market we want to reach with our product .
64766	0	a	Against the no teletext ?
64767	0	a	Yeah
64768	0	a	it is it is
64769	0	a	Standard remote .
64770	0	a	And new TVs will have internet access on them .
64771	0	a	But I think if you are targeting people of forty plus , the chance that they will have a TV with internet access within the next like twenty years is very slim .
64772	0	a	In addition people indicated that teletext simply was an important feature for the remote control .
64773	0	a	Yeah .
64774	0	a	So I think it is pretty dumb to put no teletext feature on it .
64775	0	a	I am pretty much against it .
64776	0	a	Yes .
64777	0	a	Besides that , I think the market for forty plus is like pretty small .
64778	0	a	But I mean if I s if I see this , it is I think we are just going to go for another pretty and not innovative remote control .
64779	0	a	forty
64780	0	a	Yeah .
64781	0	a	No
64782	0	a	I think we can
64783	1	a	I think we can do a lot with the design and the simple buttons
64784	0	a	which were also mentioned .
64785	1	a	if we put a lot of effort in those , we can make a remote control with just two or three buttons .
64786	1	a	Or just a remote which is suitable for the market we want to reach
64787	0	a	because it is forty percent of the market .
64788	0	a	And
64789	0	a	if you look in Holland at the whole generation of forty plus , fifty plus , it it is the the biggest share of the of the whole population now .
64790	0	a	Yes
64791	0	a	but it is not the biggest part of the market .
64792	0	a	No .
64793	0	a	And besides that , they are not very critical
64794	0	a	so
64795	0	a	I mean they do not really care what the remote control is like .
64796	0	a	They will just pretty much take the first thing they see and which looks acceptable .
64797	0	a	But do not you think that if we make a remote which is typically made for this market , that people think the people think that is the the device I have looked for although I did not realise it .
64798	0	a	So
64799	1	a	let is try it .
64800	0	a	No .
64801	0	a	I think that would be the case in the sixteen to forty five age category .
64802	0	a	because they are critical and
64803	0	a	they they want to have a fancy remote control .
64804	0	a	Yeah .
64805	0	a	People of forty plus , I mean they want it to work , but as soo as soon as it works it is okay with them .
64806	0	a	Yeah .
64807	1	a	I think that if we are If we put our marketing right we can sell this just like I do not know if you have heard about it in the news , the the elderly mobile phone ?
64808	0	a	Yeah
64809	0	a	if we if we make a remote control just l with that idea in mind , we could make tons of money , I think .
64810	0	a	So
64811	0	a	I have not heard of it .
64812	0	a	Yeah .
64813	0	a	It is a big success .
64814	0	a	Very big success .
64815	0	a	Yeah .
64816	1	a	We do not have to focus on on on the on the design then but on functionality .
64817	0	a	I think so as well .
64818	1	a	We just change our focus on the project ,
64819	0	a	and I think we can we can sell this .
64820	0	a	I simply think that the new products we are going to make , spef specifically design , are designed for younger people ,
64821	1	a	so maybe we can focus ourself on the elderly people .
64822	1	a	And I think we have to see what requirements we need for those remote controls .
64823	0	a	Cause what you told is the channel selection is important .
64824	0	a	Yes .
64825	0	a	Volume selection , power and teletext .
64826	0	a	Yes .
64827	0	a	Okay .
64828	0	a	Yeah .
64829	0	a	No
64830	0	a	we we have not voted yet ,
64831	0	a	so
64832	1	a	I think teletext can be can be a function as well .
64833	0	a	But obviously the board tends to disagree .
64834	1	a	But only if if it wo not higher the the cost ,
64835	0	a	because I do not know if it will be a lot more money to implement teletext as well , but I do not think it will be a problem .
64836	0	a	Or is teletext a
64837	0	a	Yeah .
64838	0	a	But deaf people need teletext for for subtitles .
64839	0	a	Yeah , also .
64840	0	a	So it is
64841	0	a	Yeah .
64842	0	a	Yeah .
64843	0	a	So
64844	0	a	I suggest
64845	0	a	Yeah .
64846	0	a	I think it would definitely be a bad idea not to include teletext .
64847	0	a	It is
64848	0	a	Is anybody really against teletext ?
64849	0	a	No ?
64850	0	a	Just that , that we just keep the teletext .
64851	0	a	No .
64852	0	a	I think that is a good idea as well , especially for the subtitles .
64853	1	a	Maybe we can make that another point of advantage in our remote control , if we make a k a button ex for example for big subtitles , which is instantly on the remote control .
64854	0	a	Yeah yeah .
64855	0	a	For elderly people they can think , oh I want to have subtitles , and they push the button and they get the big subtitles .
64856	0	a	that is a good idea .
64857	0	a	Yeah .
64858	0	a	Yeah .
64859	0	a	so
64860	0	a	I think teletext can v can be very useful in our advantage .
64861	0	a	Functionality should be few buttons , you said .
64862	0	a	Yes .
64863	0	a	I think that is very important we have a few buttons .
64864	0	a	Yeah .
64865	0	a	So to keep it simple .
64866	0	a	But I do not think that is really an issue any more
64867	0	a	cause
64868	0	a	Well
64869	0	a	might be .
64870	0	a	If it is only for televi
64871	0	a	Yeah .
64872	0	a	But I mean it , if it is only for TV you are not going to need a lot of buttons anyway .
64873	0	a	Yeah .
64874	0	a	You need a one to zero button , next channel , previous channel , volume up , volume down , and some teletext buttons
64875	0	a	but I think if you if you only l
64876	0	a	Nah .
64877	0	a	No .
64878	0	a	Yeah .
64879	0	a	Yeah .
64880	0	a	But do you need
64881	0	a	But do you need the buttons for one to zero .
64882	1	a	So we can s we can skip the display ,
64883	0	a	so we do not need it .
64884	0	a	Maybe c we can Maybe we can use
64885	0	a	No ,
64886	0	a	maybe we can implement the scroll button ?
64887	0	a	Or a joystick like ?
64888	0	a	There are other ways too .
64889	0	a	Yeah .
64890	0	a	Think if you are going to include teletext you do .
64891	0	a	I think many people like to use that .
64892	0	a	Cause if you should , if you want to switch from channel one to like thirty five , you do not want to push the next channel button thirty five times .
64893	0	a	Yeah .
64894	0	a	Just look if you look at telephones .
64895	0	a	Yeah .
64896	0	a	The Sony telephone has a scroll button which is very useful in searching names or
64897	0	a	That is right .
64898	0	a	Yeah .
64899	0	a	That is true
64900	0	a	but I do not think there are many TVs that can switch channels that fast .
64901	0	a	And so you would need like the TV would need an a function where you can actually view all channels and scroll through it .
64902	0	a	And I dunno if many channels would do have that .
64903	0	a	If many TVs have that .
64904	0	a	Yeah .
64905	0	a	And besides that it is
64906	0	a	If we are going to focus on elderly people they will have to adapt .
64907	0	a	They are not used to using scroll buttons .
64908	1	a	So perhaps we should s stick to the basic layout .
64909	0	a	the numbers
64910	0	a	yeah .
64911	0	a	Yeah
64912	1	a	they can see how much buttons there are going to be on on the display , and if it is too much we can reconsider it .
64913	0	a	But I think there wo not be very much buttons .
64914	0	a	Yeah .
64915	0	a	Or there do not have to be a lot .
64916	0	a	But I do not think I think if you are going to make a remote control only to operate a TV , you there is not much you can gain on having as few buttons as possible .
64917	0	a	Cause I think there are pretty many remote controls that can only operate a TV , which already only have the minimum number of buttons .
64918	0	a	I do not think there is much to be gained in that area .
64919	0	a	The number of buttons ?
64920	0	a	I think it is very important in the in the design .
64921	0	a	Yeah .
64922	0	a	You can make a very fancy design with putting the buttons on the right places .
64923	0	a	And if you have less buttons you can do a lot more with
64924	0	a	To operate only the TV
64925	0	a	yeah .
64926	0	a	That is true but I think there is simply not much to gain on the competition when you when you are making a remote control only for to operate only the TV .
64927	0	a	Cause if you have a a remote control only to operate a TV there is simply not a lot of buttons required .
64928	0	a	There is not a lot of functions required so most existing remote controls simply do not have a lot of buttons either .
64929	0	a	No .
64930	0	a	No .
64931	0	a	So .
64932	0	a	So
64933	0	a	I think it would be very hard to actually gain on the competition here .
64934	0	a	Kay .
64935	0	a	So
64936	0	a	we can
64937	0	a	Yeah .
64938	0	a	That would that would cost a a big marketing expedition which was one of the arguments to make it only for the TV because we did not have the time to market a lot .
64939	0	a	That is right .
64940	0	a	Yeah .
64941	0	a	So
64942	0	a	you suggest we could better focus on for example the docking station .
64943	0	a	like other functions .
64944	0	a	Instead of f of less buttons .
64945	0	a	Maybe .
64946	0	a	Well yeah
64947	0	a	I think , mean we obviously need a good way to position all the buttons
64948	0	a	and
64949	1	a	But I do not think we should spend very much time in that .
64950	0	a	No .
64951	0	a	Do you think the docking station will is allowed in the budget we have ?
64952	0	a	Cause it can be
64953	0	a	No .
64954	0	a	It should be possible yes .
64955	0	a	If it is not too fancy .
64956	0	a	No .
64957	0	a	And if the remote stays rather small , it should be possible
64958	0	a	yeah .
64959	0	a	Yeah .
64960	0	a	No .
64961	0	a	Because I think that is
64962	0	a	That is a good advantage point as well .
64963	0	a	If we have a fancy looking docking station
64964	0	a	or very
64965	0	a	That is a nice requirement .
64966	0	a	Yes .
64967	0	a	Docking station .
64968	0	a	So
64969	0	a	we are just going to focus on the extras ?
64970	0	a	Yeah .
64971	0	a	I think so .
64972	0	a	Yeah
64973	1	a	I think maybe we should do some research into what elderly people like to have in a like to have extra in a new remote control .
64974	0	a	Yeah .
64975	0	a	That is a good point .
64976	0	a	You said they easily get lost as well .
64977	0	a	Yes
64978	0	a	well
64979	0	a	fifty percent of the people indicated that remote control tended to get lost .
64980	0	a	Yeah .
64981	1	a	So maybe we should implement the audio sign , or something .
64982	0	a	Yeah
64983	0	a	that was what I suggested .
64984	0	a	Yeah .
64985	0	a	Like with your key chain , if you whistle it goes it makes a sound .
64986	0	a	You have it on
64987	0	a	Yeah
64988	0	a	you have it is on some phones too , which have a docking station .
64989	0	a	Yeah .
64990	0	a	Hm .
64991	0	a	Yeah .
64992	0	a	And you just press a button and the phone goes ringing .
64993	0	a	Yeah .
64994	0	a	So
64995	0	a	audio signal should be possible as well .
64996	0	a	So you know where it is .
64997	0	a	I think it is not too expensive .
64998	0	a	No .
64999	0	a	another point is the LCD screen .
65000	0	a	I do not know if that will rise the cost too much ,
65001	0	a	because
65002	0	a	Yeah .
65003	0	a	Y i
65004	0	a	I think we will have to choose between the docking station or the screen ,
65005	0	a	cause it is
65006	0	a	Well
65007	0	a	I do not think they have different television sets in every country .
65008	0	a	It will be too much as well .
65009	0	a	I think since a lot of people indicated that a new remote control is hard to learn , and we are focusing on elderly people here which tend to have a hard time understanding new devices ,
65010	1	a	it might be a good idea to have just a little screen on it , which would explain a button if you press it .
65011	1	a	Which would tell you what it does .
65012	0	a	Yeah .
65013	1	a	And it would not have to be touchscreen or a very expensive screen ,
65014	0	a	but
65015	0	a	Just a small screen
65016	0	a	with two
65017	0	a	Yeah .
65018	0	a	Based .
65019	0	a	Okay .
65020	0	a	Yeah .
65021	0	a	Just the LCD .
65022	0	a	Oh just the normal screen .
65023	0	a	That is a good idea .
65024	0	a	So
65025	0	a	Some extra info .
65026	0	a	Feedback .
65027	0	a	Yeah .
65028	0	a	Yeah .
65029	0	a	I think that is a good idea as well .
65030	0	a	But I dunno if that would that would fit into the costs .
65031	0	a	As the small screen .
65032	0	a	Extra button info .
65033	0	a	I think that should be possible as well .
65034	0	a	let is see what did we say .
65035	0	a	More .
65036	0	a	Should be fancy to , fancy design , easy to learn .
65037	0	a	Few buttons , we talked about that .
65038	0	a	Docking station , LCD .
65039	0	a	general functions
65040	0	a	Yeah .
65041	0	a	Kay .
65042	0	a	And default materials .
65043	0	a	I think that is a good idea as well ,
65044	0	a	because elderly people do not mind if it is a titanium cover or just a plastic one .
65045	0	a	So that does not really matter .
65046	0	a	No .
65047	0	a	So
65048	0	a	I think we nee
65049	1	a	let is specify the target group .
65050	0	a	I think probably elderly people would be a little bit more careful with their remote controls than youngsters .
65051	0	a	Because are we talking about elderly elderly people or people from forty to eighty .
65052	0	a	Because I think what we are going to design now is for people above sixty , maybe .
65053	0	a	Yeah .
65054	0	a	Yeah .
65055	1	a	what do we want ?
65056	1	a	If we want a with for example the the telephone for elderly people , we can target the real elderly people .
65057	0	a	I think I think that would be a
65058	0	a	If we should do something like that it would be a , I think it would be really good for for the image of the company .
65059	0	a	Yeah .
65060	0	a	And I think , I think there would be a good market for it .
65061	0	a	So
65062	0	a	that is the
65063	0	a	Now you are talking about sixty to eighty for example .
65064	0	a	If we are able to really bring an innovative product .
65065	0	a	Yeah the really
65066	1	a	But I would have to look into that a little more .
65067	0	a	Yeah .
65068	0	a	Sixty .
65069	0	a	Okay .
65070	1	a	And different cultures .
65071	1	a	Are we
65072	0	a	Okay .
65073	0	a	No .
65074	0	a	No .
65075	0	a	Cause
65076	0	a	Yeah .
65077	0	a	We have got five minutes left just now .
65078	0	a	So
65079	0	a	Kay .
65080	0	a	Kay .
65081	0	a	Small warning .
65082	0	a	And with the little screen in it , which explains the buttons .
65083	0	a	Should
65084	0	a	Yeah .
65085	0	a	You could I think we n it would be a lot easier to adapt it to different cultures .
65086	0	a	In different languages , you know .
65087	0	a	Yeah .
65088	0	a	Yeah .
65089	0	a	Yeah .
65090	1	a	or you have to put a language button in it ,
65091	0	a	but that will be a bit unnecessary I think .
65092	0	a	Right .
65093	0	a	No .
65094	0	a	Yeah .
65095	0	a	Yeah .
65096	1	a	It is better to put it on different markets with it all .
65097	0	a	Yeah .
65098	0	a	Okay .
65099	0	a	So
65100	0	a	that is the the target .
65101	1	a	then a few small things .
65102	0	a	okay .
65103	0	a	I will put the minutes in the project project document folder .
65104	0	a	what we are going to do for the next meeting is the Industrial Designer will do the components concept , User Interface Designer the user interface concept , and the trend watching .
65105	0	a	So
65106	1	a	just keep in mind the things we have said about the target group , requirements , and the trends which are going on .
65107	0	a	And specific instructions will be sent to you by the personal coach .
65108	0	a	Kay .
65109	0	a	So
65110	0	a	I thank you for this meeting .
65111	1	a	And I think we have a lunch break now .
65112	0	a	So
65113	0	a	 
65114	0	a	Okay .
65115	0	a	good afternoon .
65116	0	a	Good afternoon .
65117	0	a	This is our third meeting already .
65118	0	a	I hope you enjoyed your lunch .
65119	0	a	I did anyway .
65120	0	a	let is see .
65121	0	a	Presentation three .
65122	0	a	Okay
65123	0	a	this is the second phase we are going to discuss today .
65124	0	a	It is the conceptual design meeting .
65125	0	a	And a few points of interest in this meeting are the conceptual specification of components .
65126	0	a	conceptual specification of design .
65127	0	a	And also trend watching .
65128	0	a	these are hopefully the points you addressed in your pre presentations
65129	1	a	you are going to show me in a few minutes .
65130	1	a	but first I will show you the agenda .
65131	0	a	first the opening .
65132	0	a	Then we have three presentations .
65133	0	a	after that we have to come to a decision on remote control concepts .
65134	0	a	How we are going to make it .
65135	0	a	And then we are closing .
65136	0	a	We have about forty minutes .
65137	1	a	so I suggest let is get started .
65138	0	a	did someone encounter any problems during the preparation ?
65139	0	a	No ?
65140	0	a	Everything fine ?
65141	0	a	That is nice .
65142	0	a	No .
65143	1	a	Then a little thing about the last meeting .
65144	0	a	these are the points we agreed on .
65145	0	a	The requirements and the target market .
65146	0	a	requirements are teletext , docking station , audio signal , small screen , with some extras that button information .
65147	0	a	And we are going to use default materials .
65148	0	a	does somebody have any comments on these requirements ?
65149	0	a	Maybe ?
65150	0	a	No ?
65151	0	a	These are just the the things we thought of ,
65152	1	a	so maybe if you figured something else or thought of something else , just let me know .
65153	1	a	And maybe we can work it out .
65154	0	a	And we are going to target sixty to to eighty year old customers .
65155	0	a	So
65156	0	a	now everybody knows what we are do we are doing ,
65157	1	a	I suggest let is get started with the presentations .
65158	0	a	So
65159	0	a	shall we keep the same line up as last time ?
65160	0	a	Okay .
65161	0	a	Sure .
65162	1	a	I will start off then .
65163	0	a	Good luck .
65164	0	a	Doh .
65165	0	a	Kay
65166	1	a	I am going to inform you about the trend watching I have done over the past few days .
65167	0	a	we have done some market research .
65168	0	a	We distributed some more enquetes , questionnaires .
65169	0	a	And besides that I deployed some trend watchers to Milan and Paris to well get all of the newest trends .
65170	0	a	And I have consulted some additional trend watch trend watchers , after the original trend watchers return , about what the the best design would be .
65171	0	a	okay
65172	0	a	these are some overall findings .
65173	0	a	most important thing is the fancy design .
65174	0	a	the research indicated that that was by far the most important factor .
65175	0	a	innovativeness was about half as important as the fancy design .
65176	0	a	By innovativeness this means functions which are not featured in other remote controls .
65177	0	a	about half of , half as important as the innovativeness was the was easy to use .
65178	0	a	for our group , we are focusing on the people of sixty to eighty
65179	0	a	y years old , this is , these factors are slightly more equal .
65180	0	a	Kay
65181	0	a	these are some more group specific findings .
65182	0	a	the older people prefer dark colours .
65183	0	a	they like recognisable shapes , and familiar material .
65184	0	a	And our surveys have indicated that especially wood is pretty much the material for older people .
65185	0	a	this is , this image will give you a little bit of an impression about the look and feel that the remote should have .
65186	1	a	this leads us to some personal preferences .
65187	1	a	the remote control and the docking station should blend in in the in the room .
65188	1	a	so this would mean no eye catching designs .
65189	1	a	Just keep it simple
65190	0	a	and
65191	0	a	Well
65192	1	a	the docking station and small screen would be our main points of interest ,
65193	0	a	because this would be the These would be the innovativeness in the remote control .
65194	0	a	So this would be very important that we at least include these features .
65195	0	a	well the trend watchers I consulted advised that it b should be , the remote control and the docking station should be telephone shaped .
65196	0	a	So you could imagine that the remote control will be standing up straight in the docking station .
65197	0	a	This is not really
65198	0	a	This is pretty much a new shape to older people .
65199	0	a	So they would prefer a design where the remote control just lies flat in the docking station .
65200	1	a	So it would be kind of more telephone shaped .
65201	1	a	besides that we would advise to bring two editions , one with a wood like colour and maybe feel , and one with a grey black colour .
65202	1	a	The wood like for the more exclusive people .
65203	1	a	People with more money .
65204	1	a	the grey black colour for well people with less means .
65205	0	a	That would be all .
65206	0	a	Okay .
65207	0	a	Thank you .
65208	0	a	Any questions about the the trends ?
65209	0	a	Mayb
65210	0	a	No ?
65211	0	a	Okay ,
65212	1	a	we go on to the next one .
65213	0	a	Any questions ?
65214	0	a	And how exactly does the kinetic energy work ?
65215	0	a	You just
65216	0	a	You use it and it works .
65217	0	a	no .
65218	0	a	kay
65219	0	a	yeah .
65220	0	a	some research a about designing of an interface .
65221	0	a	the last meeting we had a about using a f few buttons .
65222	0	a	So
65223	0	a	that is w
65224	0	a	what I what I want to to do in our design .
65225	0	a	So
65226	0	a	finding an attractive way to control the remote control .
65227	0	a	the I found some something about speech recognition .
65228	0	a	So
65229	1	a	maybe we can use that .
65230	0	a	and using a little display .
65231	0	a	So
65232	0	a	findings .
65233	0	a	yeah
65234	0	a	just we have just to focus on the primary functions .
65235	0	a	So
65236	0	a	only buttons for sound , for on off , shifting u up sa ca channel or down shifting down .
65237	0	a	let is see .
65238	0	a	yeah and
65239	0	a	we need some new a attractive functions which attract people for using it .
65240	0	a	So
65241	1	a	it is like a speak speech recognition and a special button for selecting subtitles .
65242	0	a	Just what we mentioned last meeting .
65243	0	a	and yeah
65244	0	a	overall user friendly .
65245	0	a	So
65246	1	a	using large large buttons .
65247	0	a	It is possible to to make quite cheap system for speech recognition .
65248	1	a	you can think about when you lost your remote control , you can call it and it gives an sig signal .
65249	0	a	So yeah .
65250	1	a	And and for shifting up a sen c ch channel or for putting out sound or something , you can just give a sign
65251	1	a	say sound off
65252	0	a	or A and
65253	0	a	yeah .
65254	1	a	Television put the sound off put the sound off .
65255	0	a	Let is see .
65256	0	a	yeah .
65257	0	a	I was thinking about the special button for subtitles ,
65258	1	a	just one button to keep it simple .
65259	1	a	one push on the button you get small subtitles .
65260	1	a	double push push , if double click , so you get big subtitles , for people which c f who ca not read small subtitles .
65261	0	a	So Yeah
65262	0	a	and w we have to keep in general buttons
65263	0	a	so
65264	1	a	we have got the buttons we have to use .
65265	1	a	The on off , sound on off , sound higher or lower , the numbers , zero to nine .
65266	1	a	the general buttons m more general b one button for shifting up and shifting down channel .
65267	0	a	also we want to use a little d display for for displaying the the functions of the buttons .
65268	1	a	And we can build in a function f which shows the channel or some which the t television is on .
65269	0	a	So
65270	0	a	made a little picture of it .
65271	0	a	See .
65272	0	a	yeah .
65273	1	a	Just we can put the on off button over in this corner ,
65274	0	a	almost e all remote controls are using a on off button on that place .
65275	0	a	so people will recognise the button .
65276	0	a	So
65277	1	a	D display of it
65278	1	a	, it is just a small display .
65279	1	a	you can put it on top .
65280	0	a	it is most place where people , most of looks at .
65281	0	a	So
65282	1	a	and a special button for shifting up and shifting down channel , it is on place where the thumb of of the
65283	0	a	So you you can easily shift up or shift down .
65284	0	a	it is quite handy place .
65285	0	a	So and
65286	0	a	all the f functions for subtitle one button , for sound
65287	1	a	and for our design , we have to discuss about it
65288	1	a	I think so the form of it
65289	0	a	so
65290	0	a	And that is it .
65291	0	a	Okay .
65292	0	a	thank you .
65293	0	a	Okay .
65294	0	a	About the components design .
65295	1	a	for the energy source we can use a basic battery or , a as an optional thing , a kinetic energy , like in a watch ,
65296	0	a	which you just shake and it produces energy .
65297	0	a	But if we choose for that option , the docking station would c become obsolete .
65298	0	a	So I do not think it is really an option .
65299	0	a	for the casing , the manufacturing department can deliver a flat casing , single or double curved casing .
65300	0	a	It is really up the the design that we are going to use .
65301	0	a	It is does not imply any technical restrictions .
65302	1	a	as a case supplement , we could , I thought of that l later , a rubber belt , like a anti slip .
65303	1	a	for the b buttons , we can use plastic or rubber .
65304	0	a	And the chip set , it says simple here ,
65305	1	a	but it should be advanced ,
65306	0	a	because we are using an LCD screen .
65307	0	a	And as the trend watcher presentation showed , people like wood ,
65308	0	a	but it raises the price and it does not really fit the image , unless we would start two product lines .
65309	1	a	Form should follow function overall .
65310	0	a	well the kinetic energy source is rather fancy .
65311	0	a	But depends on what we want .
65312	1	a	I think we should disc discuss that .
65313	0	a	for the case , the supplement and the buttons , it really depends on the designer .
65314	1	a	And the chip set really should be advanced
65315	0	a	because otherwise it would really be a simple remote control .
65316	0	a	And that is it .
65317	0	a	Okay .
65318	0	a	Thank you .
65319	0	a	So
65320	1	a	that brings us to the discussion about our concepts .
65321	0	a	Kay .
65322	0	a	So
65323	0	a	these are the points we have to discuss .
65324	1	a	first I think we can talk about the energy source ,
65325	0	a	since that is has a pretty big influence on production price , and image .
65326	0	a	so
65327	0	a	f I think first of all we have to see it is possible to introduce kinetic energy in our budget , I think .
65328	0	a	Yes
65329	0	a	w
65330	0	a	there there are four options .
65331	0	a	We could use the basic normal battery .
65332	0	a	Yeah .
65333	0	a	a hand dynamo .
65334	0	a	But I do not think that is really an option .
65335	0	a	Okay .
65336	0	a	You do not want to swing before you can watch television .
65337	0	a	Yeah .
65338	0	a	solar cells .
65339	0	a	But not every room is very light
65340	0	a	so it is not a very good option .
65341	0	a	No .
65342	0	a	Or the kinetic energy .
65343	0	a	Yeah .
65344	0	a	Okay .
65345	0	a	Well
65346	0	a	y you basically shake your remote , and then it powers up .
65347	0	a	Yeah .
65348	0	a	Yeah .
65349	0	a	Okay .
65350	0	a	Nah .
65351	0	a	Well
65352	0	a	personally I do not think that older people like to shake their remote control before they use it .
65353	0	a	Yeah .
65354	0	a	That is true .
65355	0	a	And besides that you mentioned it would make the docking station obsolete .
65356	0	a	Oh .
65357	0	a	And I think our docking station could be one of the marketing issues with which we can get great popularity for our product .
65358	0	a	Yeah .
65359	0	a	But
65360	0	a	what is the function ?
65361	0	a	Yeah f for loading up the batteries
65362	0	a	wel
65363	0	a	Yeah
65364	0	a	you could load up the batteries , you could insert the find the lost remote control function in there .
65365	0	a	B b
65366	0	a	Okay
65367	0	a	but it wo not use much e energy
65368	0	a	I I believe .
65369	0	a	it is just a small display
65370	0	a	so I believe it will run on one battery for six months or f or or more .
65371	1	a	So I believe one battery is just enough .
65372	0	a	well
65373	0	a	I think elderly people just like to have everything in place .
65374	0	a	so
65375	0	a	Okay .
65376	0	a	That is true .
65377	0	a	And I do not think they they like remotes just laying everywhere in their rooms .
65378	0	a	So maybe a docking station will help them give the remote a place .
65379	0	a	Yeah .
65380	0	a	That is true .
65381	0	a	Yeah .
65382	0	a	And also what you said .
65383	0	a	you can introduce voice recognition by finding back your remote .
65384	0	a	Yeah .
65385	0	a	But I think it is more efficient and cheaper to put it in the docking station .
65386	1	a	So you have a but button on your docking station which you can push , and then it starts beeping .
65387	0	a	Okay .
65388	0	a	And then we can we can still use the voice recognition , but maybe then for only the the channels .
65389	0	a	Yeah .
65390	0	a	That is safe .
65391	0	a	I am wondering what will the voice recognition mean for the production price ?
65392	0	a	Cause in our earlier market research ,
65393	0	a	if you would allow me to go to the flat board , SMARTboard .
65394	0	a	Yeah .
65395	0	a	That is a good point .
65396	0	a	I do not have any information on pricing .
65397	1	a	So I will have to ask the manufacturing department .
65398	0	a	Yeah , sure .
65399	0	a	Go ahead .
65400	0	a	so
65401	0	a	it was open here .
65402	0	a	we also asked if w they would , if people would pay more for speech recognition in a remote control .
65403	0	a	Well
65404	0	a	you can see here , our target group would not do that .
65405	0	a	No .
65406	0	a	So if that would increase the price for which we are selling our remote control I would greatly advise not to do it .
65407	0	a	Yeah .
65408	1	a	I think that would be better to insert in our other product , that is meant for the younger people .
65409	0	a	Yeah .
65410	0	a	But that would also go for the LCD screen then I guess .
65411	0	a	Kay .
65412	0	a	It is a bit higher percentage ,
65413	0	a	but
65414	0	a	Okay .
65415	0	a	well
65416	0	a	this is
65417	0	a	Yeah
65418	0	a	but this is
65419	0	a	here the question was , would you prefer it .
65420	0	a	So that does not really mean they would not pay extra for it .
65421	0	a	And on top of that the LCD screen would help in making the remote control easier to use .
65422	0	a	Yeah .
65423	0	a	Yeah .
65424	0	a	And I think a voice recognition function would not make the remote control much easier to use .
65425	0	a	Easier to use ?
65426	0	a	No , I think that is a good point .
65427	0	a	But is our research about bi large LCD sh display , or just a small one we want to use ?
65428	0	a	Okay .
65429	0	a	well
65430	0	a	this was for like an LCD screen like you would have on a on the the most advanced mobile phones .
65431	0	a	So pretty large .
65432	0	a	Yeah .
65433	0	a	Yeah .
65434	0	a	I personally think the LCD screen we want to use , with the extra information , I think nobody has anything against it .
65435	0	a	Because it is just some extra information , and it is easy to ignore as well .
65436	0	a	No .
65437	0	a	Yeah .
65438	0	a	So if you do not want to use it you just do not use it .
65439	0	a	And yeah
65440	0	a	I think the
65441	1	a	Maybe we have to discard the voice recognition .
65442	0	a	Because it will increase cost signifi significantly .
65443	0	a	And I do not think the I do not think it will be a lot easier to use , as well .
65444	0	a	Yeah .
65445	0	a	So
65446	1	a	that brings us back to the energy .
65447	0	a	If we do not have the voice recognition , it will it wo not use a lot of energy to use .
65448	0	a	So
65449	1	a	in that case we could use kinetic energy , but I think just a simple battery which you can reload on a docking station is just as good .
65450	0	a	And much cheaper as well .
65451	0	a	Yeah .
65452	0	a	So Okay
65453	1	a	let me just choose for the battery .
65454	0	a	And that is the best choice .
65455	1	a	That brings us to the chip .
65456	0	a	Well
65457	0	a	there is not any choice there because we are using the the the the display .
65458	0	a	Just the advanced .
65459	0	a	So it is gotta be advanced .
65460	0	a	Okay
65461	0	a	, advanced chip .
65462	0	a	Kay .
65463	1	a	And then we get to the point of the case .
65464	0	a	which brings us a little bit back to marketing as well .
65465	1	a	if we want to choose for wood or the black and grey .
65466	1	a	Or both ?
65467	0	a	as we saw there is not
65468	0	a	Yeah
65469	0	a	wood is a lot more expensive to produce .
65470	0	a	but I think it will attract elderly people who want to have something exclusive , which they can show off to their grandkids .
65471	0	a	Look I have got a new remote control , and
65472	0	a	Yeah .
65473	0	a	Well
65474	0	a	And I think most important factor there is the wooden colour .
65475	0	a	I dunno .
65476	1	a	So it would not actually have to be wood , if it is just wood coloured .
65477	0	a	That is right .
65478	0	a	But with colour was a lot more expensive ?
65479	0	a	Or ?
65480	0	a	You do not know ?
65481	0	a	I think so
65482	0	a	because
65483	0	a	Yeah .
65484	0	a	I dunno .
65485	1	a	I will have to research .
65486	0	a	Probably .
65487	0	a	It is a lot more difficult to to handle and to to get in the right shape .
65488	0	a	is it possible to make changeable case .
65489	0	a	So
65490	0	a	you cause
65491	0	a	Yeah
65492	0	a	with mobile phones so like the Nokia mobile phones , when you can change the case of it .
65493	0	a	Yeah .
65494	0	a	Change the cases .
65495	0	a	So
65496	0	a	maybe it is possible possibility .
65497	0	a	Yeah .
65498	0	a	So
65499	1	a	you have just to make one standard remote control , and
65500	1	a	yeah you can sell few
65501	0	a	Yeah .
65502	1	a	You can sell the cases .
65503	0	a	Yeah .
65504	0	a	I think that is a very good option .
65505	1	a	Because then you can advertise as well
65506	0	a	with the
65507	1	a	Give your grandfather a new case for his remote control , or whatever .
65508	0	a	Yeah .
65509	0	a	Because that is a it is something extra , it is something other remotes do not have , which we can get a great advantage point .
65510	0	a	Yeah .
65511	0	a	Yeah that is true .
65512	0	a	So
65513	1	a	and then you can make them with colour .
65514	1	a	Black and grey , other colours as well .
65515	0	a	Yeah .
65516	0	a	Yeah .
65517	1	a	We would have to look carefully into the design though .
65518	1	a	Costs .
65519	0	a	Cause we would have to make one w control which would fit in with a wooden cover and a plastic cover .
65520	0	a	Yeah .
65521	0	a	The more original one , or the more standard one .
65522	0	a	Yeah .
65523	0	a	So that would
65524	0	a	Well
65525	0	a	I would not design a telephone
65526	0	a	but
65527	0	a	Well
65528	0	a	no
65529	1	a	I think w we should just , we should then just design one one remote , but it would have to be fancy with either the wood cover or the plastic one .
65530	0	a	So
65531	0	a	you suggest we should design two different telephones on which you can apply , yeah remote controls , on which you can apply different case covers , for example .
65532	1	a	Remote .
65533	0	a	Yeah .
65534	0	a	Okay .
65535	0	a	So ,
65536	0	a	but that should not be too much of a problem .
65537	0	a	So
65538	0	a	everybody is okay with the changing covers ?
65539	0	a	I think that is a good good option .
65540	0	a	Yes .
65541	0	a	Yeah .
65542	0	a	Changing case covers .
65543	0	a	I heard our Industrial Designer talk about flat , single and double curved .
65544	0	a	Yes .
65545	0	a	Yeah .
65546	0	a	Could you explain that a little more ?
65547	0	a	Well
65548	0	a	the the general like most older remotes are flat , just straight .
65549	0	a	And our d manufacturing department can also deliver single curved or double curved ca curved cases .
65550	0	a	And what would single curved and double curved mean ?
65551	0	a	Okay .
65552	0	a	it would just only affect the form , for as far as I know .
65553	0	a	So
65554	0	a	it is j really just up to the design department what we are going to use .
65555	0	a	It does not really matter for the price or the functionality .
65556	0	a	So
65557	0	a	we can pretty much just do whatever we want .
65558	0	a	Pick one you like , yes .
65559	0	a	Kay .
65560	0	a	Okay .
65561	0	a	That is good .
65562	0	a	but the form has to be
65563	0	a	It has to
65564	0	a	It is has to be possible to stand up ?
65565	0	a	Or just only to lie down ?
65566	0	a	And the the cover of the the docking station is also on top of the television then ?
65567	0	a	Or not ?
65568	1	a	And you can just yeah then click it in .
65569	0	a	No just to lie down .
65570	0	a	okay .
65571	1	a	We will go for that .
65572	0	a	Well
65573	0	a	or besides it .
65574	0	a	That is okay .
65575	0	a	so
65576	1	a	the interface .
65577	1	a	What type of interface do we want to use ?
65578	1	a	maybe you can make a little drawing of it on the on the the board .
65579	1	a	Does somebody have ideas for a form
65580	0	a	or
65581	0	a	Yep .
65582	1	a	we can just use the regular form of it ,
65583	0	a	but it is not quite fancy .
65584	0	a	So
65585	0	a	Yeah .
65586	0	a	you said you wanted to put the changing channels button on the right side , so you could , so your thumb would be easily
65587	0	a	Well
65588	0	a	I think that was a very good point
65589	0	a	cause I pointed out earlier that a lot of remotes cause RSI .
65590	0	a	Yeah .
65591	0	a	Yeah .
65592	0	a	So that would be great for that .
65593	1	a	I thought maybe we could just make one of those buttons on both the left and the right side .
65594	0	a	For for
65595	0	a	Yeah yeah .
65596	1	a	For left handed users also .
65597	0	a	Yeah
65598	0	a	we
65599	0	a	Is it possible to program it
65600	0	a	s
65601	0	a	so you got on the left side or on the right side buttons for for shifting u up and shifting up ?
65602	0	a	And on the other o other side buttons for shifting , for for the sound ?
65603	0	a	Or Or is not it ?
65604	0	a	Yeah okay .
65605	0	a	For the volume .
65606	0	a	well
65607	0	a	that could
65608	0	a	Yeah
65609	0	a	we could do that
65610	0	a	but I am not sure if that would be very good for the easy , ease of use .
65611	0	a	Usabili
65612	0	a	Yeah ease of use will be a lot more difficult ,
65613	0	a	and then it is
65614	0	a	But you have extra buttons .
65615	0	a	But if we would make a changing channels and changing volume button on both sides , that would certainly yield great options for the design of the remote .
65616	0	a	Cause it could be made all symmetrical and stuff .
65617	0	a	Yeah
65618	0	a	but
65619	0	a	Yeah .
65620	0	a	So people can get confused .
65621	0	a	Yeah .
65622	0	a	That is true .
65623	0	a	Yeah .
65624	0	a	Especially if they have the same writings on it .
65625	0	a	See yeah .
65626	1	a	Or we have to make a left For lefties
65627	0	a	and You mean
65628	0	a	Yeah
65629	0	a	if
65630	0	a	no .
65631	0	a	Ca not we make Ca not we make a remote which you can flip over and use on the same functions as the normal one ?
65632	0	a	Then you have to Let is see if I ca
65633	0	a	A blank one .
65634	0	a	And then you get
65635	0	a	Here is a little LCD screen .
65636	0	a	now I have to think .
65637	0	a	It is a plus and a min .
65638	0	a	No it is not very handy I think .
65639	0	a	Because the plus and the min will be opposite
65640	0	a	and all kinds of
65641	0	a	No that is not going to work .
65642	0	a	Yeah .
65643	0	a	Yeah .
65644	0	a	I guess .
65645	0	a	Maybe we should
65646	0	a	Yeah .
65647	0	a	Yeah .
65648	0	a	But is it a problem that left handed persons use a different hand ?
65649	0	a	I think the functions are that basic that nobody should have any problems with choosing a channel
65650	0	a	or
65651	0	a	Y
65652	0	a	yeah .
65653	0	a	Yeah .
65654	0	a	That is true .
65655	0	a	It is just u using your thumb .
65656	0	a	So
65657	0	a	it is
65658	0	a	Yeah .
65659	0	a	Yeah .
65660	1	a	I think we could just leave it a normal shape .
65661	0	a	Yeah .
65662	1	a	but maybe we have to make it a l a bit more fancy .
65663	1	a	In one or ano another way .
65664	0	a	Yeah .
65665	0	a	Yeah yeah .
65666	1	a	I think we should start by by choosing a case .
65667	0	a	Because that is the basis you are building on .
65668	0	a	Yeah .
65669	0	a	Yeah .
65670	0	a	yeah
65671	0	a	just
65672	0	a	Yeah .
65673	0	a	So
65674	1	a	I could draw them out .
65675	1	a	Let is look at the flat case .
65676	0	a	Oh .
65677	0	a	It is from the side so it is rather normal .
65678	0	a	The the single curved so I am not really sure what they are going to look like , but I think it is something like this .
65679	0	a	So
65680	0	a	this type should be better for you
65681	0	a	or better Should prevent repetitive strain injury a bit .
65682	0	a	Easier ?
65683	0	a	Kay .
65684	0	a	And the double curved s looks something like this I guess .
65685	0	a	So
65686	0	a	th those are the three options we have .
65687	1	a	I suggest the single curved ,
65688	0	a	because maybe the curve is pretty good to put the the screen in .
65689	0	a	so that elderly people can use the remote control and at the same time look easily at the screen , because it is a bit , it has a bit of a angle .
65690	0	a	So
65691	0	a	Do you say this
65692	0	a	S
65693	0	a	you got like sort of a
65694	0	a	I believe There ?
65695	0	a	So
65696	0	a	you want to put a display over here ?
65697	0	a	Or not ?
65698	0	a	Yeah .
65699	0	a	Yeah .
65700	0	a	I think so .
65701	0	a	Yeah .
65702	0	a	Yeah .
65703	0	a	But now it is
65704	0	a	Do you have it upside down
65705	0	a	or
65706	0	a	Do you have it
65707	0	a	this that is top ?
65708	0	a	Okay .
65709	0	a	we can make it
65710	0	a	That is the top .
65711	0	a	So
65712	0	a	this top .
65713	0	a	This down .
65714	0	a	maybe it is possible to make this side like
65715	0	a	Let is see .
65716	0	a	Colour
65717	0	a	okay .
65718	1	a	to make this side like the right colour .
65719	1	a	bit like so in the form of your hand .
65720	0	a	So
65721	0	a	it is an
65722	0	a	So so
65723	0	a	the remote control have to lay in your hand .
65724	0	a	Yeah .
65725	0	a	So
65726	0	a	it is possib
65727	0	a	yeah
65728	0	a	for s
65729	0	a	so and
65730	1	a	And to put the the buttons for changing the channel over here
65731	0	a	Yeah .
65732	0	a	So
65733	0	a	get your mouse .
65734	0	a	Yeah .
65735	0	a	Yeah .
65736	0	a	That is a good one .
65737	0	a	Yeah .
65738	1	a	But I think it is better to put the screen on top .
65739	0	a	rem
65740	0	a	Yeah
65741	0	a	but this place it is
65742	0	a	Yeah
65743	0	a	I dunno
65744	0	a	Yeah .
65745	0	a	So
65746	1	a	just flip it a hundred and eighty degrees around
65747	0	a	then you get here .
65748	1	a	If you can have this one , you turn it like this .
65749	1	a	And then flip it upside down .
65750	0	a	Because maybe your hand is in the way , if you have the display here .
65751	0	a	It is more logical to have it on top as well
65752	0	a	because , like on your mobile phone , it is always above .
65753	0	a	I think i
65754	0	a	On top .
65755	0	a	Yeah
65756	0	a	so So
65757	0	a	Five minutes .
65758	0	a	Yeah .
65759	0	a	Yeah .
65760	0	a	Oh
65761	1	a	maybe you should just s start on a blank page .
65762	0	a	Yeah .
65763	0	a	So
65764	0	a	then we get Here is
65765	0	a	That is the curve .
65766	1	a	Here the display , and then buttons .
65767	0	a	Yeah
65768	1	a	and then we can have a little bit off here and here maybe .
65769	0	a	Just that is for left hand and right hand users .
65770	0	a	Yeah .
65771	1	a	And then h the rest of the buttons over here .
65772	0	a	Yeah .
65773	0	a	But the on off button , still on the top
65774	0	a	Yeah .
65775	0	a	Yeah still here
65776	0	a	jus That is
65777	0	a	Yeah .
65778	0	a	Yeah .
65779	1	a	And I would prefer the corners to be round .
65780	0	a	Yeah .
65781	0	a	Kay .
65782	0	a	Think that would be better .
65783	0	a	Should be more bit more friendly , yeah .
65784	0	a	Friendly on the eye .
65785	0	a	Kay .
65786	0	a	Supplements .
65787	0	a	That is okay .
65788	0	a	Where is my mouse ?
65789	0	a	Then We have got a general idea of the concepts and the materials we are going to use .
65790	0	a	So now
65791	0	a	for the next meeting we will have to look at the look and feel design .
65792	0	a	It is important that the corporate design image is going to be in the remote .
65793	1	a	So check out the corporate website maybe .
65794	0	a	The user interface design , it is the same story .
65795	0	a	And product evaluation .
65796	0	a	So the Industrial Designer and User Interface Designer are going to work together on this one .
65797	0	a	But you are going to get your instructions I think sended by the coach .
65798	0	a	So
65799	1	a	just I will put these minutes on the in the folder .
65800	0	a	Okay .
65801	1	a	And then we are going to try to finish our project , and make a good design for all the grandfathers and grandmothers , I think .
65802	0	a	Which are
65803	0	a	let is see .
65804	0	a	I am not sure if you are going to start right away to work together
65805	0	a	or
65806	0	a	I think you are going to fill in the questionnaires first .
65807	0	a	Yeah .
65808	0	a	Yeah .
65809	0	a	And then you will get a message .
65810	0	a	Yeah .
65811	0	a	So
65812	0	a	that is basically it .
65813	0	a	Maybe this one ?
65814	1	a	Then we can save this one in the folders group .
65815	0	a	yes , it is here .
65816	0	a	Yeah .
65817	0	a	SMARTboard , there it it .
65818	0	a	So
65819	0	a	if you want to have a look at it , it is over there in the projects folder .
65820	0	a	Yeah .
65821	1	a	And then I guess we will start in thirty minutes again .
65822	0	a	 
65823	0	a	So
65824	0	a	Hello .
65825	0	a	Good afternoon .
65826	0	a	Sorry I am a little late .
65827	0	a	No problem .
65828	0	a	Got stuck in the traffic .
65829	0	a	Okay .
65830	0	a	That is possible on this time of day .
65831	0	a	Starts at three o'clock .
65832	0	a	, let me see .
65833	0	a	Yeah .
65834	0	a	Our fourth and last meeting .
65835	0	a	There he is .
65836	0	a	Yes .
65837	0	a	Okay
65838	0	a	this our last meeting .
65839	0	a	In this meeting we will discuss our final design .
65840	0	a	And we will do some evaluation about the , not only the product , but also the project .
65841	0	a	And then we are going to close the project today as well .
65842	0	a	So
65843	0	a	after this you will be free to go and spend all your money .
65844	0	a	And this design , detailed design meeting we will discuss the look and feel of the design , the usability interface design , and we will do the product evaluation .
65845	0	a	, in order to do that we have this agenda .
65846	0	a	We will have the prototype presentation first .
65847	0	a	Then we will set up some evaluation cri criteria .
65848	0	a	Then we will look at the finance .
65849	0	a	we will have to see if everything we want to do is also possible within our budget .
65850	0	a	Because everything costs money , and the more functions you want to have the more money it will cost .
65851	0	a	So we have to see if it fits within the twelve and a half Euro per remote .
65852	0	a	But we will see that later .
65853	0	a	Then we will do the project evaluation , and the closing after that .
65854	0	a	We have got forty minutes .
65855	0	a	So we will be finished at half past three .
65856	1	a	But first we will do the this is prototype presentation .
65857	0	a	So ,
65858	1	a	if some
65859	1	a	yeah
65860	1	a	if somebody wants step forward .
65861	0	a	Okay .
65862	0	a	Well
65863	0	a	this is what me and Richard came up with .
65864	0	a	The default spot for the on off button .
65865	0	a	The mute button just below that .
65866	0	a	Then there is the volume and channel selectors .
65867	0	a	Simple plus minus button .
65868	0	a	we thought of a help button .
65869	0	a	If you hold it and you press another button , the help goes to the LCD screen .
65870	0	a	Then there is the zero to one to zero buttons .
65871	0	a	A button for teletext .
65872	0	a	A button for the subtitles .
65873	0	a	And the company logo .
65874	0	a	So it is rather simple prototype .
65875	1	a	And we will have to see from testing how the users take it .
65876	0	a	Okay .
65877	0	a	, is this the moment where we ask or can ask questions about the functionality ?
65878	0	a	, when you are in teletext there usually are buttons where you just you just press it and
65879	0	a	you g go to the next teletext page .
65880	0	a	So
65881	0	a	Yeah .
65882	0	a	Sure
65883	1	a	just pop in at any time .
65884	0	a	Yeah .
65885	0	a	, that is just the normal as th as the normal remote controls
65886	0	a	So
65887	0	a	You put it
65888	0	a	you came in page one hundred .
65889	0	a	Now you can use the normal one to zero buttons .
65890	0	a	And you
65891	0	a	But you can also use the button th for changing the the channel .
65892	0	a	S so the shifting button .
65893	0	a	Okay .
65894	0	a	for
65895	0	a	yeah
65896	0	a	shif shifting up in on t on t teletext , and shifting down .
65897	0	a	So
65898	0	a	Oh yeah ?
65899	0	a	Yeah .
65900	0	a	Okay .
65901	0	a	Yeah .
65902	0	a	Okay .
65903	0	a	but
65904	0	a	I thought in a few meetings earlier we tried to keep it simple .
65905	0	a	just a few buttons and large buttons .
65906	0	a	But I think these are altogether quite a quite a few buttons .
65907	0	a	So I am wondering if we if we neely really need all of those buttons .
65908	0	a	I think if you look at most controls , they have got more buttons than this .
65909	0	a	That is right .
65910	0	a	And well
65911	0	a	the on off button , it is it is a necessity .
65912	0	a	You ca not drop that one .
65913	0	a	Yeah .
65914	0	a	Yeah .
65915	0	a	The volume and channel buttons , you need you obviously need those those .
65916	0	a	Yeah .
65917	1	a	The mute button could be replaced by pressing the volume down button twice .
65918	1	a	So we could cancel that one .
65919	0	a	I think the help button really is necessary because there is no other way to know when someone wants to know what a button does .
65920	0	a	Yeah yeah .
65921	1	a	, or you can build in when you press one button
65922	0	a	Yeah .
65923	1	a	Long time .
65924	0	a	Yeah .
65925	0	a	If you put
65926	0	a	Yeah .
65927	0	a	But m
65928	0	a	Yeah .
65929	0	a	We disc discuss that already .
65930	0	a	But we think old people do not know that option .
65931	0	a	So they just put in put press the button and
65932	0	a	And
65933	0	a	Oh .
65934	0	a	Okay .
65935	0	a	Well ,
65936	0	a	you ca not leave out the number buttons I guess .
65937	0	a	Yeah .
65938	0	a	And
65939	0	a	Yeah .
65940	0	a	teletext and subtitles are
65941	0	a	yeah necessary .
65942	0	a	Yeah .
65943	0	a	Okay .
65944	0	a	So it is rather basic already .
65945	0	a	Yeah .
65946	0	a	Think so .
65947	0	a	That is what I pointed out earlier .
65948	0	a	If you just make a control for just the TV there is just not much to gain here .
65949	0	a	Yeah .
65950	0	a	Yep .
65951	0	a	Okay .
65952	0	a	So
65953	0	a	we had somebody about th interfa
65954	0	a	Something about the design of the buttons there ?
65955	0	a	Just n normal plain buttons .
65956	0	a	Yeah ,
65957	0	a	they are
65958	0	a	It is rather hard to draw on the white board .
65959	0	a	Yeah .
65960	0	a	Yeah ,
65961	0	a	it
65962	0	a	Yeah yeah .
65963	0	a	But they are supposed to be equal sized , round , with a with a little logo on it for the for the volume , the the triangle and stuff .
65964	0	a	Yeah .
65965	0	a	Just to recognise it ,
65966	0	a	so yeah
65967	0	a	and now we do not need LEDs
65968	0	a	or Y
65969	0	a	s some remote controls do it also , but because we use the little display we do not have to use it .
65970	0	a	Kay .
65971	0	a	Just for recognition .
65972	0	a	No .
65973	0	a	No .
65974	0	a	so
65975	0	a	Nay .
65976	0	a	Yeah .
65977	0	a	Okay .
65978	0	a	So
65979	0	a	and for the materials we have just chosen for rubber buttons .
65980	0	a	With a a different colour than the case .
65981	0	a	Yep .
65982	0	a	So they jump out .
65983	0	a	Okay .
65984	0	a	And that is about it .
65985	0	a	That is nice .
65986	0	a	Then because we only have thirty minutes left ,
65987	1	a	I will move on to the finance part ,
65988	0	a	which is pretty exciting , to see if it is all possible what we want to do .
65989	0	a	And I can tell you that we are going to have a pretty hard time producing this for twelve and a half Euros .
65990	1	a	If we see
65991	0	a	I do not know if I have filled in correctly ,
65992	1	a	so just correct me if you see something wrong .
65993	0	a	I counted two batteries .
65994	1	a	But maybe we can also use one .
65995	0	a	I do not know if it is possible .
65996	0	a	Since it rechargeable .
65997	0	a	It is rechargeable .
65998	0	a	That is right .
65999	0	a	Yeah we can
66000	0	a	u just
66001	0	a	Kay .
66002	0	a	Okay .
66003	0	a	That is two Euros off .
66004	0	a	We need the advanced chip .
66005	0	a	So there is not much to to save there .
66006	0	a	Yep .
66007	0	a	Here we have the single curves .
66008	0	a	we can see that the difference between uncurved and the single curved is one Euro .
66009	0	a	I do not know , but I think the single curved is good for design , and also for the display to have a prominent place on the remote control .
66010	0	a	Yeah .
66011	0	a	Yes .
66012	1	a	I think we have to keep that .
66013	0	a	Yeah .
66014	0	a	Then we have the case material supplements .
66015	0	a	It is plastic .
66016	0	a	It is the cheapest one we need .
66017	0	a	So that is not much to save either .
66018	0	a	But then the biggest costs are the buttons .
66019	1	a	So maybe we really should try to discard some buttons to keep our costs low .
66020	0	a	Okay .
66021	0	a	Yeah .
66022	0	a	Because you have to we will have to get the twelve and a half Euros at the end .
66023	0	a	so if we
66024	1	a	Let is fir first count the buttons we have now .
66025	0	a	Sixteen , I believe so .
66026	0	a	Because I
66027	0	a	Sixteen .
66028	0	a	Nah ,
66029	0	a	that will be even more then .
66030	0	a	Eighteen Euros .
66031	0	a	So ,
66032	0	a	seventeen .
66033	0	a	seventeen .
66034	0	a	Damn .
66035	0	a	with the help button .
66036	0	a	Okay , including the help ?
66037	0	a	Yeah .
66038	0	a	Yep .
66039	0	a	Yeah .
66040	0	a	seventeen .
66041	1	a	I think we can discard the help and the mute button by pressing down volume long , or pressing down a a number long .
66042	0	a	Yep .
66043	0	a	That saves us one Euro already .
66044	0	a	Cause then we have got fifteen I think ?
66045	0	a	Fifteen buttons .
66046	0	a	Yeah .
66047	0	a	Would not
66048	0	a	Yeah .
66049	0	a	No .
66050	0	a	That would not be an option .
66051	0	a	And this is
66052	0	a	No those are one , I think .
66053	0	a	, d I assume you would count the volume and channel thingies for two buttons each ,
66054	0	a	right ?
66055	0	a	Well ,
66056	0	a	think actually there are two buttons ,
66057	0	a	are not they ?
66058	0	a	Well
66059	1	a	I was thinking , maybe you could just integrate three of those numbers to one button .
66060	0	a	Yeah .
66061	0	a	Where did
66062	0	a	, it is just one button .
66063	0	a	But , Yeah .
66064	0	a	There were two for one big button .
66065	0	a	But they are more expensive than the small ones .
66066	0	a	, yeah .
66067	0	a	Yeah
66068	0	a	but th it is not stated in this files .
66069	0	a	So
66070	0	a	It is just a .
66071	1	a	So maybe we can we can even make one button with the volume and the channel in one , by pressing
66072	0	a	That is possibility as well .
66073	0	a	That would cut the cost .
66074	0	a	So
66075	0	a	And it is good for the design as well .
66076	0	a	So you can make
66077	0	a	let is see .
66078	1	a	If you make this
66079	0	a	Looks a bit like a cross .
66080	0	a	Plus .
66081	0	a	Min .
66082	0	a	But I do not do not know if if it is cheaper .
66083	0	a	s yeah
66084	0	a	channel .
66085	0	a	So ,
66086	0	a	we have still got four buttons ,
66087	0	a	but just So
66088	0	a	You got not not a butt button itself , but on the
66089	0	a	Yeah .
66090	0	a	Yeah
66091	0	a	w
66092	0	a	Yeah
66093	0	a	th I think they count the materials .
66094	0	a	Yeah
66095	0	a	on the chip there .
66096	0	a	On the chip you have got still four four buttons .
66097	0	a	Yeah .
66098	0	a	Yeah .
66099	0	a	That is right .
66100	0	a	That is right .
66101	0	a	So
66102	0	a	Yeah ,
66103	0	a	but .
66104	0	a	Yeah .
66105	0	a	But I think because we have the advanced chip we can just count this as one button .
66106	0	a	But
66107	0	a	No
66108	0	a	but I think
66109	0	a	Yeah .
66110	0	a	But , I think this really is four buttons anyhow .
66111	0	a	Yes .
66112	0	a	Maybe it is , but then it seems to me that it is impossible to get the twelve and a half Euros .
66113	0	a	Also the LC display , I think it is , I think it is too expensive for the display we use .
66114	0	a	Yes .
66115	0	a	that is that is a big cost .
66116	0	a	I think they try t
66117	0	a	That is right ,
66118	0	a	but what is the big advantage of our remote then ?
66119	0	a	Yeah .
66120	0	a	If we leave out the display we can also save money on the chip .
66121	0	a	Only the docking station , I guess .
66122	0	a	Which is not the the docking station is not even in this c s schematic .
66123	0	a	No .
66124	0	a	So
66125	0	a	it is not even taken into the price .
66126	0	a	That is extra .
66127	0	a	That is extra .
66128	0	a	That is right .
66129	1	a	Maybe we should to a different supplier .
66130	0	a	That is an option .
66131	1	a	Poland .
66132	1	a	Something .
66133	0	a	Yeah .
66134	1	a	Polish supplier .
66135	1	a	Do not you think we can , if we can count this as v as one button , and integrate th these buttons in three ,
66136	0	a	then we save a lot of money as well .
66137	0	a	We we could save money on it .
66138	0	a	But would it make the remote more usable for elderly people ?
66139	0	a	My mother ca not even send send an SMS message .
66140	0	a	Yeah , that is what I am wondering .
66141	0	a	So
66142	0	a	Yeah .
66143	0	a	Yeah .
66144	0	a	That is a point .
66145	0	a	Well ,
66146	0	a	since the market research indicated that older people spend their money easier , more easy ,
66147	1	a	maybe it is feasible to just put the price of the remote up a little .
66148	0	a	Are we going to buy a a remote control when you can use it ?
66149	0	a	So Yeah .
66150	0	a	We m we must stay below the below twelve fifty
66151	0	a	or Ca not go
66152	0	a	Nay .
66153	0	a	Yep .
66154	0	a	No .
66155	0	a	Especially since we have those nice features .
66156	0	a	Yeah
66157	0	a	but we have to stick to the twelve and a half Euros .
66158	0	a	We do not have any more budget to develop it .
66159	0	a	The margin will get too small .
66160	0	a	Is it impossible to
66161	0	a	But it is possible to make one for twelve fifty .
66162	0	a	Yeah .
66163	0	a	Yeah .
66164	0	a	So
66165	0	a	It is .
66166	0	a	I do not think so .
66167	0	a	If you leave out the LC display .
66168	0	a	It would be a be a pretty rigid one .
66169	0	a	S
66170	0	a	Yeah .
66171	0	a	And if you use less buttons .
66172	0	a	Say Or you can take the single chip .
66173	0	a	Ten .
66174	0	a	But , you ca not use
66175	0	a	Yeah .
66176	0	a	There it is .
66177	0	a	But then w
66178	0	a	Good looking .
66179	0	a	, wi with n Oh , with attractive o options .
66180	0	a	Yeah .
66181	0	a	So ,
66182	0	a	you can stay below twelve fifty .
66183	0	a	So
66184	0	a	Scroll wheel is one .
66185	0	a	I think it is difficult as well ,
66186	0	a	but
66187	1	a	Or we can leave out the ten buttons and take one scroll wheel for the programme numbers .
66188	0	a	Or b
66189	0	a	Basically becoming a choice between like either a good remote and a higher production cost , or just any other remote control .
66190	0	a	No remote .
66191	0	a	Then w
66192	0	a	Because then we save ten buttons .
66193	0	a	That is
66194	0	a	We are getting closer .
66195	0	a	No ,
66196	0	a	it
66197	0	a	Yeah .
66198	0	a	Then we have five and one .
66199	0	a	And and see .
66200	0	a	If we have this one and we have got the advanced
66201	0	a	W , we are getting close .
66202	0	a	Yeah .
66203	1	a	But how does scroll wheel work here ?
66204	0	a	That would bring up the price of the scroll wheel also .
66205	0	a	Then you will Or maybe you can scroll .
66206	1	a	If you scroll you will see the numbers on the LCD display .
66207	1	a	Until you have got the right number , then you push it .
66208	0	a	Yeah .
66209	0	a	Alright .
66210	0	a	Integrated scroll wheel push button .
66211	0	a	It is gotta scroll and push .
66212	0	a	Okay
66213	1	a	but then you you can push some other button as well .
66214	0	a	But Yeah .
66215	1	a	You could just not scroll for a half a second .
66216	0	a	Yeah .
66217	0	a	So you wo not need a button .
66218	0	a	That is right .
66219	0	a	So if you scroll to a number
66220	0	a	and then you wait a half second ,
66221	0	a	then it g turns to that channel .
66222	0	a	I think that would be like the end of our usability .
66223	0	a	D
66224	0	a	yeah .
66225	0	a	But it would definitely crop cost , a lot .
66226	0	a	Yeah ,
66227	0	a	but
66228	0	a	Well ,
66229	0	a	think it is pretty much the teletext subtitles are
66230	0	a	right now you just push the teletext button , go to page eight eight eight , and teletext disappears .
66231	0	a	And we need the battery .
66232	0	a	And the regular chip is not possible ?
66233	0	a	It has to be advanced ?
66234	0	a	It has to be advanced .
66235	0	a	If you want to use an LCD screen you you need an advanced chip , yes .
66236	0	a	Yeah .
66237	0	a	Okay .
66238	1	a	And we can save a Euro by a flat design .
66239	0	a	That is an option we can
66240	0	a	Then we are almost there .
66241	0	a	Yep .
66242	0	a	Ja ja .
66243	0	a	Yeah if you v could just leave out one more button .
66244	0	a	Yeah .
66245	0	a	So
66246	0	a	if we
66247	0	a	Yeah
66248	0	a	but I think that is That is a big advantage ,
66249	0	a	if we are
66250	0	a	But Can we use
66251	0	a	ca not we integrate the teletext and the subtitles in one button ?
66252	0	a	If you push it three times ?
66253	0	a	Yeah .
66254	0	a	Yeah ,
66255	1	a	or we have to skip the subtitle button .
66256	0	a	Yeah .
66257	0	a	So Yeah
66258	0	a	Yeah it is a big advantage .
66259	0	a	But , it is
66260	0	a	, yeah .
66261	0	a	I think so .
66262	0	a	Yeah .
66263	0	a	Yeah .
66264	0	a	Yeah .
66265	0	a	But the subtitles stay there .
66266	0	a	But if you push the teletext button twice It is One m one b , a few buttons .
66267	0	a	I think that is the case on most
66268	0	a	Well ,
66269	0	a	that could be just like the scroll to eight , click , scroll to eight , click , scroll to eight , click .
66270	0	a	What if you have to scroll to page eighty eight ?
66271	0	a	Eight hundred eighty eight .
66272	0	a	that is not really that
66273	0	a	No .
66274	0	a	Yeah .
66275	0	a	Okay .
66276	0	a	But then again that would be d j just pretty much not an option for older people ,
66277	0	a	who do not even know what a scroll wheel is .
66278	0	a	No .
66279	0	a	Yeah .
66280	0	a	Holding a remote with which they expect to have like ten buttons for the numbers one to zero .
66281	0	a	With only five buttons on it .
66282	0	a	And a scroll wheel .
66283	1	a	I think if you make a good advertisement on television and in the in the guide , you can explain to the people how to use the scroll wheel .
66284	1	a	If you just make it real simple .
66285	0	a	Because it saves it saves a lot of money .
66286	0	a	And we can keep our LCD screen , which can provide extra information .
66287	0	a	How to use the scroll wheel .
66288	0	a	How to use the other bu buttons as subtitles .
66289	0	a	True .
66290	0	a	True .
66291	0	a	And it is good for the innovative design as well .
66292	0	a	If you would erase these .
66293	0	a	eraser ?
66294	0	a	And we put
66295	0	a	Looks a bit odd maybe .
66296	0	a	That is a pretty big scroll wheel .
66297	0	a	That is
66298	1	a	Something like that .
66299	1	a	Then , yeah .
66300	1	a	We have got the scroll wheel .
66301	1	a	One , two , three , four , five buttons , if we erase this one .
66302	0	a	And these are two buttons then .
66303	1	a	We could make two buttons out of that .
66304	1	a	And just If you press the volume button you can control the volume with the scroll wheel .
66305	0	a	Yeah .
66306	1	a	So that would save two buttons .
66307	1	a	If you do the same for the channel .
66308	0	a	Yeah .
66309	0	a	That is really a good good idea , I think .
66310	0	a	And it will make the use of the scroll wheel more obvious indeed .
66311	0	a	More obvious .
66312	0	a	So we make one for the volume , one for the channel .
66313	0	a	Plus scroll .
66314	0	a	So
66315	0	a	if we
66316	0	a	Yeah .
66317	0	a	That is right .
66318	0	a	So we have got one , two , three .
66319	0	a	Yeah ,
66320	0	a	we can leave the teletext in if we want .
66321	0	a	Yeah .
66322	0	a	That is m that is better .
66323	0	a	So
66324	1	a	If we leave out all those buttons , perhaps you can go with the flat flat case .
66325	0	a	So this is five buttons .
66326	1	a	And make it smaller overall .
66327	1	a	So if you put the the volume and channel buttons on the same height as the on off button , the screen right behi under that , than the scroll button
66328	0	a	you get a a much smaller remote .
66329	0	a	Y
66330	0	a	yeah .
66331	0	a	yeah .
66332	0	a	yeah ,
66333	0	a	and then you can
66334	0	a	That is right .
66335	0	a	yeah .
66336	0	a	And it sh
66337	0	a	Yeah ?
66338	0	a	Yeah .
66339	0	a	So we can decrease this one to four buttons .
66340	0	a	Right now we have five .
66341	0	a	But , you can make a f quite a big remote remote control for just the same price as a small one .
66342	0	a	Yeah .
66343	0	a	Just you only have to pay for the double curved or single curved .
66344	0	a	That is no problem .
66345	0	a	It it is a bit .
66346	0	a	Yeah .
66347	0	a	Yeah .
66348	0	a	It is it is more the moulds in which they are being made , I think .
66349	0	a	Single curved is really easy to just fill in .
66350	0	a	And cases come right out of the machine .
66351	0	a	And single curved you have to have a different different machine , than a flat one .
66352	0	a	I think this is a really easy one .
66353	0	a	what does everybody think about a flat or a single curved design ?
66354	0	a	Freek , what do you think ?
66355	0	a	Yeah .
66356	0	a	Well ,
66357	0	a	I still think we should go for the single curve design .
66358	0	a	But then again , all these changes are not really okay with me .
66359	0	a	Richard is argument was very good .
66360	0	a	Yeah .
66361	0	a	Yeah .
66362	0	a	Yep .
66363	0	a	But since we just have to .
66364	0	a	We have to cut costs .
66365	0	a	Yeah .
66366	0	a	Yeah .
66367	0	a	Yeah
66368	0	a	I am ag
66369	0	a	Ask for more money .
66370	0	a	I would rather just go to the board and get us to spend eighteen dollars a a remote .
66371	0	a	Yeah .
66372	0	a	Yeah .
66373	0	a	I am agreeing with the usability .
66374	1	a	Or do some market research and see what the options are .
66375	0	a	Yeah .
66376	0	a	Yeah .
66377	0	a	But th I think we can then keep the single curved one .
66378	0	a	Just to express our LCD screen a bit more .
66379	0	a	Yep .
66380	0	a	Yeah .
66381	0	a	So people will use it more , and especially for the help functions ,
66382	0	a	it will be good if we have scroll bar , scroll button .
66383	0	a	Yeah .
66384	1	a	It will be necessary to have good help function , as well .
66385	0	a	So
66386	0	a	this is scroll .
66387	0	a	I think it was better to have this price list a bit earlier .
66388	0	a	Before we went on to the to the whole design .
66389	0	a	Yes .
66390	0	a	Definitely .
66391	0	a	The th
66392	0	a	No .
66393	0	a	But I am glad we could make a bit .
66394	0	a	Yeah .
66395	0	a	It is pretty different , if you saw the last one than this one .
66396	0	a	It is pretty different .
66397	0	a	But this is not really like for the group we were making our remote .
66398	0	a	This will really require a lot of marketing to get this to sell .
66399	0	a	Yeah .
66400	0	a	It will .
66401	0	a	Yeah .
66402	0	a	Cause if older people like familiar forms and familiar stuff .
66403	0	a	But
66404	0	a	But they know the scroll buttons from old radios .
66405	0	a	This is not familiar for them .
66406	0	a	No ,
66407	0	a	but I think I think the most
66408	0	a	That is right .
66409	0	a	So we are going to have to do a lotta convincing them .
66410	0	a	they cal also buttons like that for changing channels .
66411	0	a	Yeah .
66412	0	a	So maybe it is
66413	0	a	Yeah .
66414	0	a	We can let l
66415	1	a	We can stick it out , a bit .
66416	1	a	Like a old old buttons .
66417	0	a	Yeah .
66418	0	a	Maybe that is recognisable for them as well .
66419	0	a	Yeah .
66420	0	a	Yeah .
66421	0	a	That is a good one .
66422	0	a	So ,
66423	1	a	I am afraid we have to move on .
66424	0	a	And it is it is b less frightening , I think .
66425	0	a	If they see this design they think
66426	0	a	oh , there are only five buttons , and
66427	0	a	But we will see .
66428	0	a	Yeah .
66429	0	a	That is true .
66430	0	a	Might might be confusing too .
66431	0	a	Yeah .
66432	0	a	That is definitely right .
66433	0	a	They would be like , what ?
66434	0	a	Only five buttons ?
66435	0	a	Yeah .
66436	0	a	Yeah .
66437	0	a	But very special ,
66438	0	a	so
66439	0	a	No .
66440	0	a	I would buy it .
66441	0	a	But you are not sixty .
66442	0	a	That is right .
66443	0	a	I would buy it if I was six .
66444	0	a	No I do not know .
66445	0	a	What it costs under twelve and a half Euros ?
66446	0	a	No ?
66447	0	a	, yes they are .
66448	0	a	No .
66449	1	a	But we can go on with the project evaluation .
66450	0	a	Let is see .
66451	1	a	I can sit down I think .
66452	0	a	We still have fifteen minutes left ,
66453	0	a	so we are nice on schedule .
66454	0	a	Yeah .
66455	1	a	, the project process .
66456	0	a	So ,
66457	0	a	I like set up all these criteria .
66458	0	a	And evaluation of the thingy .
66459	0	a	Evaluation criteria .
66460	0	a	That is right .
66461	0	a	That was the the point I forgot .
66462	0	a	I should
66463	0	a	There we are .
66464	0	a	Evaluation criteria .
66465	0	a	Thank you .
66466	1	a	Go ahead .
66467	0	a	We have got five minutes I think for those criteria .
66468	0	a	Five more minutes ?
66469	0	a	Okay .
66470	0	a	No we have got fifteen minutes
66471	0	a	but
66472	0	a	yes .
66473	0	a	What ?
66474	0	a	yeah .
66475	0	a	Kay so
66476	0	a	I did some literature study study , and analysis of the requirements we set up earlier .
66477	0	a	Translated it into criteria , which would be these .
66478	0	a	, is the remote fancy ?
66479	0	a	The shape , look and feel .
66480	0	a	Innovative ?
66481	0	a	What new functions are there ? , easy to use ?
66482	0	a	, learnability is a very important factor here .
66483	0	a	, is it functional ?
66484	0	a	Are there not too many functions among the functions ?
66485	0	a	And are the those functions that are there , are they useful ?
66486	0	a	And the cost .
66487	0	a	The target group .
66488	0	a	Is the remote really for the group we are making it for ?
66489	0	a	And recognability .
66490	0	a	If our company is If it is easily recognisable that our company made it ?
66491	0	a	And
66492	1	a	So we are supposed to evaluate it right now .
66493	0	a	Okay .
66494	1	a	Let is see .
66495	0	a	Oh
66496	0	a	I have to say this was a little hard ,
66497	0	a	because the minutes of our last meeting were not here .
66498	0	a	Yeah ,
66499	0	a	that is because my pen failed to upload his data .
66500	0	a	Okay .
66501	0	a	Yeah ? .
66502	0	a	I tried to but it is it is giving errors by downloading the software .
66503	0	a	Interesting .
66504	0	a	So
66505	0	a	Is the design fancy , on a scale of one to seven ?
66506	0	a	We all go for six ?
66507	0	a	Good .
66508	0	a	Kay .
66509	0	a	I think it is fancy .
66510	0	a	Six .
66511	0	a	Yeah .
66512	0	a	six .
66513	0	a	Yeah .
66514	0	a	Six .
66515	0	a	, is the design innovative ?
66516	0	a	I think so ,
66517	0	a	with our LCD screen , docking station , scroll buttons .
66518	0	a	Very .
66519	0	a	Sh
66520	0	a	Yeah .
66521	0	a	Subtitles , buttons .
66522	0	a	Yeah .
66523	0	a	Yeah .
66524	0	a	Seven .
66525	0	a	Seven ?
66526	0	a	Should be do able .
66527	0	a	Yeah .
66528	0	a	So we have got twenty cents for our docking station ,
66529	0	a	huh ?
66530	0	a	Yeah .
66531	0	a	That is right .
66532	0	a	Is the design easy to use ?
66533	0	a	Well
66534	0	a	Would be for us .
66535	0	a	Not really .
66536	0	a	That is a bit dodgy .
66537	0	a	But
66538	0	a	I would go for four , too .
66539	0	a	For old people I I W
66540	0	a	Yeah .
66541	0	a	I would say four .
66542	0	a	Four or five .
66543	0	a	Four or five between .
66544	0	a	Yes .
66545	0	a	Four .
66546	0	a	Between four or five .
66547	0	a	Yeah .
66548	0	a	Yeah .
66549	0	a	Is it functional ?
66550	0	a	Yes .
66551	0	a	Is the design functional ?
66552	0	a	, do we have all functions that we want to include ?
66553	0	a	I think we do .
66554	0	a	N
66555	0	a	Yeah .
66556	0	a	Do we have too many functions ?
66557	0	a	I do not think so .
66558	0	a	No .
66559	0	a	No .
66560	0	a	No .
66561	0	a	It is pretty slim .
66562	0	a	Think it is seven .
66563	0	a	Seven .
66564	0	a	Oh ,
66565	0	a	and do we take care of the biggest frustrations of the remote control ?
66566	0	a	Like it getting lost and RSI influences ?
66567	0	a	Think we do .
66568	0	a	m
66569	0	a	Yeah .
66570	0	a	, we have not thought of that one .
66571	0	a	It was .
66572	0	a	I had them worked out .
66573	0	a	They are ugly , not very functional , and getting lost .
66574	0	a	Are the production costs within the preset limits ?
66575	0	a	Well
66576	0	a	they are now .
66577	0	a	Yeah .
66578	0	a	Does the design fit the group of focus ?
66579	0	a	Yeah .
66580	0	a	I think that is a three .
66581	0	a	, th
66582	0	a	yeah .
66583	0	a	No I think with our new radio button
66584	0	a	, I think it is
66585	0	a	I think it is better .
66586	0	a	I think it does not .
66587	0	a	Yeah .
66588	1	a	We have to test it
66589	0	a	s
66590	0	a	But
66591	0	a	, yeah , true .
66592	0	a	I do not know .
66593	0	a	I still I think it is too m too fancy .
66594	0	a	I think
66595	0	a	I think a radio button is not exactly what older people expect to have a remote control .
66596	0	a	I think it
66597	0	a	Yeah .
66598	0	a	Too too flashy .
66599	0	a	I would give it a four .
66600	0	a	I am not sure .
66601	0	a	I think I would go for two .
66602	0	a	I go for three .
66603	0	a	So
66604	0	a	Yeah yeah .
66605	0	a	Then we have to do the three .
66606	0	a	It is the
66607	0	a	Yes it is .
66608	0	a	Kay .
66609	0	a	Is the company company recognisable ?
66610	0	a	Well ,
66611	0	a	we have the logo there .
66612	0	a	Yeah .
66613	0	a	So
66614	0	a	Yeah .
66615	0	a	And they want to put fashion in their products .
66616	0	a	in the slogan of the company .
66617	0	a	And we have the removable front cases .
66618	0	a	Yeah .
66619	0	a	So , I think it is very recognisable .
66620	0	a	Yep .
66621	0	a	So that will be this .
66622	0	a	I was also supposed to calculate the score ,
66623	1	a	but thought we would have another private thingy after this .
66624	0	a	We have got a calculate it .
66625	0	a	N
66626	0	a	We have going to We are going to evaluate it .
66627	0	a	Twendag sieven an twendag .
66628	0	a	Is this
66629	0	a	Like
66630	0	a	after this , are we done ?
66631	0	a	Or
66632	0	a	We are going to go to our other room again .
66633	0	a	Well , anyhow .
66634	0	a	These are seven factors times seven is forty something .
66635	0	a	Two ?
66636	0	a	No .
66637	0	a	Nine ?
66638	0	a	, minus one .
66639	0	a	Forty nine .
66640	0	a	Minus three , minus four .
66641	0	a	Minus four .
66642	0	a	So that would be minus eight .
66643	0	a	Forty one out of forty nine .
66644	0	a	Forty one .
66645	0	a	That is Around eighty percent .
66646	0	a	Okay .
66647	0	a	What is it ?
66648	0	a	That is eighty four percent .
66649	1	a	Guess I will just type that in on the bottom here .
66650	0	a	I think that is a pretty nice score .
66651	0	a	Yeah .
66652	0	a	Yeah .
66653	0	a	Kay .
66654	0	a	So
66655	0	a	that will be the evaluation .
66656	0	a	Okay .
66657	0	a	Thank you .
66658	0	a	So ,
66659	0	a	that brings us to the project evaluation .
66660	0	a	Yep .
66661	0	a	Thank you .
66662	0	a	Project process .
66663	0	a	Did we move through the right phases , you think ?
66664	0	a	Along the process ?
66665	0	a	That is right .
66666	0	a	Yes .
66667	0	a	Yeah .
66668	0	a	But it
66669	0	a	Yeah .
66670	0	a	Think we should have a should have had the finance thingy a lot earlier .
66671	0	a	In the design phase .
66672	0	a	So lack of information about prices .
66673	0	a	Yeah .
66674	0	a	Yeah .
66675	0	a	Yeah .
66676	0	a	That is true .
66677	0	a	Definitely .
66678	0	a	Okay .
66679	0	a	Okay .
66680	0	a	Satisfaction .
66681	0	a	Was there room for creativity ?
66682	0	a	No ?
66683	0	a	It is because of the finance sheet .
66684	0	a	No .
66685	0	a	Not too much .
66686	0	a	No .
66687	0	a	Yeah .
66688	0	a	Yeah .
66689	0	a	Yeah , there w there was enough room , but the finance
66690	0	a	Yes .
66691	0	a	Yeah , true .
66692	0	a	But
66693	0	a	And I would have liked to go for the younger users also .
66694	0	a	The room was
66695	0	a	Yeah .
66696	0	a	Yeah .
66697	1	a	And just to be able to access internet and get something of your own .
66698	0	a	Restrictions .
66699	0	a	Internet access .
66700	0	a	Kay .
66701	0	a	Leadership .
66702	0	a	Was it clear what everybody had to do according to their roles and functions ?
66703	0	a	Yeah ?
66704	0	a	Teamwork ?
66705	0	a	Did it work out ?
66706	0	a	Working together ?
66707	0	a	Also , you two of you with the last phase ?
66708	0	a	Nice .
66709	0	a	Yeah .
66710	0	a	Yeah .
66711	0	a	So
66712	0	a	Yeah .
66713	0	a	Yes , was okay .
66714	0	a	The tasks are very structured , so you can just do step by step
66715	0	a	and it is very easy .
66716	0	a	tasks .
66717	0	a	Okay .
66718	0	a	Were the means sufficient for the tasks we had to do ?
66719	0	a	Or were they too much ?
66720	0	a	Smart board .
66721	0	a	Well ,
66722	0	a	the smart board , the d d drawing is just a pain in the ass , but The digital the digital pen is very nice .
66723	0	a	Yeah .
66724	0	a	If it wants to download its data .
66725	0	a	Yeah .
66726	0	a	But
66727	0	a	Yeah .
66728	0	a	Yes .
66729	0	a	Yeah .
66730	0	a	Yeah .
66731	0	a	Failed download .
66732	0	a	Smart board was irritating .
66733	0	a	So you rather wanted to have a flip over ?
66734	0	a	Or something else ?
66735	0	a	Faster as well , I think .
66736	0	a	A flip over or a more precise digit
66737	0	a	Yes .
66738	0	a	A flipper is easier ,
66739	0	a	so
66740	0	a	Yeah .
66741	0	a	Yeah .
66742	0	a	Yeah .
66743	0	a	Flip over .
66744	0	a	But if you want to share of when you make a picture like this on the presentation , it is easier to share it with other people .
66745	0	a	so
66746	0	a	you can sh save it and put it on the internet , or in shared f folder or sh shared directory .
66747	0	a	Yeah .
66748	0	a	Yeah ,
66749	0	a	I tried to open the file on my laptop , but not possible .
66750	0	a	So So
66751	0	a	Yeah ?
66752	0	a	No ?
66753	0	a	T can can you export it like a Yeah .
66754	0	a	No .
66755	0	a	Did not work .
66756	0	a	you need a smart board application I think .
66757	0	a	Yeah .
66758	0	a	But I think you can
66759	0	a	Yeah .
66760	0	a	Should be possible .
66761	0	a	no .
66762	0	a	Yeah you can export it as image .
66763	0	a	Must
66764	0	a	Yeah
66765	0	a	must be
66766	0	a	So
66767	0	a	the sharing of the information was was okay ?
66768	0	a	, network .
66769	0	a	Should have done that then .
66770	0	a	Pen is here .
66771	0	a	Yes .
66772	0	a	Yeah , pen is here on the table .
66773	0	a	, yeah .
66774	0	a	So
66775	0	a	you can
66776	0	a	It is possible .
66777	0	a	Yeah .
66778	0	a	It is possible .
66779	0	a	Yeah .
66780	0	a	Okay .
66781	0	a	Okay .
66782	0	a	That is nice .
66783	0	a	Have we found new ideas for having this kind of meetings ?
66784	0	a	Or
66785	0	a	Yeah .
66786	0	a	, yeah
66787	0	a	maybe when we n just give the numbers of of o one of out of s sev
66788	0	a	it is easier to to do the th things that are like that on a computer .
66789	0	a	Yeah .
66790	0	a	, so just l like at u university
66791	0	a	So
66792	0	a	Yeah .
66793	0	a	So Yeah .
66794	0	a	So
66795	0	a	everybody puts his own score .
66796	0	a	And then it mediates the score , and you can get one
66797	0	a	Yeah .
66798	0	a	Yeah .
66799	0	a	Yeah .
66800	0	a	Yeah .
66801	0	a	That is better .
66802	0	a	So that is
66803	0	a	How do we call ?
66804	0	a	Evaluation criteria .
66805	0	a	Okay .
66806	0	a	any more ideas ?
66807	0	a	Or questions about the project ?
66808	0	a	Or about the product ?
66809	0	a	Because I think then that we get to our last sheet .
66810	0	a	Are the costs within the budget ?
66811	0	a	Yeah .
66812	0	a	yeah .
66813	0	a	They are .
66814	0	a	Considering we are not going to make a docking station .
66815	0	a	Do we
66816	0	a	Docking station .
66817	0	a	That is a good point .
66818	0	a	But maybe because of the docking station the price of the remote can also be a little bit higher ?
66819	0	a	and I think you can compensate that as well .
66820	0	a	Yeah .
66821	0	a	Perhaps .
66822	0	a	So I think that should not be the biggest problem ,
66823	0	a	because it is very cheap to make as well .
66824	0	a	Yeah .
66825	0	a	Do we think we going to get the twelve and a half million ?
66826	0	a	Or what was it ?
66827	0	a	Fifteen fifteen million .
66828	0	a	Fifty grand .
66829	0	a	I think we will .
66830	0	a	If we going to export this product .
66831	0	a	It is innovative .
66832	0	a	Yeah .
66833	0	a	Especially in America .
66834	0	a	People are pretty decadent .
66835	0	a	Yeah .
66836	0	a	Sometimes .
66837	0	a	Yeah ,
66838	0	a	still I think
66839	0	a	I mean
66840	0	a	if we are n going to make a scroll button anyway
66841	0	a	it would be more for the younger people than for the older people .
66842	0	a	Yeah .
66843	0	a	You can do more .
66844	0	a	Yeah .
66845	1	a	So maybe we should just re focus .
66846	0	a	Just put it on the market for everybody .
66847	1	a	You can you can change markets where by changing the front covers .
66848	0	a	Or specifically for younger people .
66849	1	a	That is one thing you can change it with .
66850	0	a	That is true .
66851	1	a	So you can also try to reach the younger people by putting fancy covers on on the market .
66852	1	a	Just as a test .
66853	1	a	See how it works .
66854	0	a	That is I think a good advantage .
66855	0	a	Yeah ,
66856	0	a	I think then it would be way more popular with younger people than it is , than would be with older people .
66857	0	a	Yeah .
66858	0	a	Even if it were their covers .
66859	1	a	, then I think we can have our little celebration , right now .
66860	0	a	But
66861	0	a	Party party .
66862	0	a	That is it .
66863	0	a	Yeah .
66864	0	a	I think we still have to fit in one more questionnaire .
66865	0	a	Where is the champagne ?
66866	0	a	, I believe y
66867	0	a	Okay .
66868	0	a	Kay .
66869	0	a	I think .
66870	0	a	I do not know .
66871	0	a	I did not get a message
66872	0	a	from the from ending of the
66873	0	a	Oh
66874	0	a	I think I have one now .
66875	0	a	Oh
66876	0	a	you did .
66877	0	a	Five more minutes ?
66878	0	a	Oh that is nice .
66879	0	a	Then we still have some questions .
66880	1	a	If somebody has some questions they can ask them now .
66881	1	a	Or we can put these in the project folder as well .
66882	0	a	Maybe that is
66883	0	a	Export as picture , I think .
66884	0	a	Yeah .
66885	0	a	Yeah .
66886	0	a	Yeah .
66887	0	a	This is another network , I guess .
66888	0	a	Does somebody see the project folder ?
66889	0	a	I do not .
66890	0	a	My Documents .
66891	1	a	maybe they will save it .
66892	0	a	So
66893	0	a	Okay .
66894	0	a	Yeah ,
66895	1	a	I will just put it in My Documents
66896	0	a	and
66897	0	a	That is okay .
66898	0	a	Yeah , it probably will .
66899	0	a	Okay .
66900	1	a	I think I am going to make our final presentation now .
66901	0	a	Oh yeah ,
66902	0	a	you are supposed to make a final
66903	0	a	Are we supposed to go into our own rooms again ?
66904	0	a	Yeah .
66905	1	a	And then I will be back in about ten minutes to show you the final presentation .
66906	0	a	Okay .
66907	1	a	Summary of the project .
66908	0	a	maybe we have to fill another questionnaire .
66909	0	a	Yeah .
66910	0	a	Questionnaire .
66911	0	a	So
66912	0	a	Yeah .
66913	0	a	I think you all get a questionnaire in in your room .
66914	0	a	Yeah .
66915	1	a	And then I will meet you in
66916	1	a	I think about ten minutes , or something .
66917	0	a	Hopefully my pen will download its software .
66918	0	a	Yeah .
66919	0	a	Oh .
66920	0	a	 
66921	0	a	Two .

66967	0	a	Okay .
66968	0	a	Yeah .
66969	0	a	We are going to make a remote control .
66970	0	a	Yeah , that is right .
66971	0	a	I think my laptop is a bit etchy .
66972	0	a	I just made a a simple presentation .
66973	0	a	So you put some things in it .
66974	0	a	Okay .
66975	0	a	How does this work ?
66976	0	a	I dunno .
66977	1	a	One most to the right .
66978	0	a	p
66979	0	a	Okay .
66980	0	a	Yes that one .
66981	0	a	This one ?

66984	1	a	Press F eleven .
66985	0	a	Okay .
66986	0	a	So
66987	0	a	that is my name , .
66988	0	a	we are going to make a remote control , you already know that .
66989	1	a	Just have a look ,
66990	0	a	are we going to this agenda of our meeting .
66991	0	a	You know , this is about twenty five minutes , this meeting .
66992	0	a	So
66993	0	a	the thing we have to know is
66994	0	a	you already know what we are going to do ,
66995	0	a	you also read what this the things or , not yet ,
66996	0	a	okay .
66997	0	a	Yes .
66998	0	a	So , yeah ,
66999	0	a	it has to be original , trendy , user friendly that is what we are going to design .
67000	0	a	first we have three steps of making the the remote control .
67001	0	a	Fir the first thing is th the functional design ,
67002	0	a	that is very important .
67003	0	a	We have to look what the needs are , the effects of the functional design , and and how the the the remote control works , so that is where we are going to look in the functional design , it is for the f next meeting .
67004	0	a	The the second thing is the conceptual design ,
67005	0	a	that is what it
67006	0	a	that is the spe the specifications of the components and the properties and the specifications of the user interface .
67007	0	a	And we have to look what the market is doing for what kind of remote controls are in the market .
67008	0	a	And the third thing is the detailed design
67009	0	a	and that is exa
67010	0	a	yeah ,
67011	0	a	you know what it is , it is exactly how it looks and whatever .
67012	0	a	Okay so no ,
67013	0	a	this is a
67014	0	a	these are two smartboards , with the f s an introduction of that one .
67015	0	a	And you already saw you know all that that you here can put things in the the red project map .
67016	0	a	Folder ,
67017	0	a	yes .
67018	0	a	Folder , okay .
67019	0	a	So no okay
67020	1	a	have a look at that one .
67021	0	a	Okay .
67022	0	a	So
67023	0	a	what we are going to do first is
67024	0	a	so
67025	0	a	you can read .
67026	0	a	You have to draw a favourite animal on the whiteboard and and say why it is your favourite animal .
67027	0	a	So
67028	0	a	and you have
67029	0	a	this is just to try it out
67030	0	a	and we have to use a different pen colours and different thickness of the pen .
67031	0	a	So okay , so
67032	1	a	first have to show you ,
67033	1	a	maybe you can come here to have a look how it works .
67034	0	a	Yes ?
67035	0	a	Okay .
67036	0	a	I can see it now .
67037	0	a	Yeah .
67038	0	a	This a new page ,
67039	0	a	it is okay .
67040	1	a	Use pen format .
67041	0	a	and a different colour can use here
67042	0	a	no
67043	1	a	I just take the pink .
67044	0	a	You take
67045	0	a	oh
67046	0	a	there is no pink ,

67056	0	a	just take
67057	1	a	what I am going to draw is an elephant .
67058	1	a	Just draw slowly ,
67059	0	a	because otherwise it wo not work .
67060	0	a	It is a very nice elephant , you can see .
67061	0	a	I dunno what it looks
67062	0	a	but it does not matter .
67063	0	a	Looks very nice .

67072	0	a	Just takes so long ,
67073	0	a	okay .
67074	0	a	Whatever ,
67075	0	a	just .
67076	0	a	You erased this one .
67077	0	a	It is a bit slow you can see ,
67078	0	a	this is a bit annoying .
67079	0	a	Okay .
67080	0	a	Okay , so
67081	1	a	just for you guys just one of you can draw a painting if you want .

67177	0	a	No , not yet , okay .

67185	0	a	I d
67186	0	a	I
67187	0	a	I thought it would be just in in in typed words in Word , so that is not
67188	0	a	just
67189	0	a	it is just a picture .
67190	0	a	You really got to write on that paper .
67191	0	a	Yeah yeah ,
67192	0	a	it is a real pen .

67201	0	a	No .
67202	0	a	Oh , okay .
67203	0	a	It is a donkey .
67204	0	a	I do not know ,
67205	0	a	what time did we start this meeting ,
67206	0	a	I am not sure .
67207	0	a	I think it was
67208	0	a	Yeah .
67209	0	a	Half past .
67210	0	a	Half past ten .
67211	0	a	Okay .
67212	0	a	Brilliant .
67213	0	a	Okay ,
67214	0	a	perfect .
67215	0	a	Nice ,
67216	0	a	eh ?
67217	0	a	Yep .
67218	0	a	Yeah ,
67219	0	a	thank you .
67220	1	a	Now we just have to save everything ,
67221	0	a	so .
67222	0	a	Oh
67223	0	a	this is definitely the best one .
67224	0	a	Okay , so
67225	0	a	what we know is that we have to sell this remote control for about twenty five Euros .
67226	0	a	Excuse me .
67227	0	a	Okay ,
67228	0	a	that is .
67229	0	a	And we have to make a profit of fifty million Euros , so we have to use a big market in Europe .
67230	0	a	Piece of cake .
67231	0	a	The production cost are about half the price of selling price ,
67232	0	a	sorry .
67233	0	a	easy .
67234	0	a	So
67235	0	a	can someone make a a calculation about how many we have to sell of these to make fifty million ,
67236	0	a	I dunno .
67237	0	a	so
67238	0	a	we are going to have a little discussion about what experience are with a remote control the and everything ,
67239	1	a	so just have a look how it we think about remote controls .
67240	0	a	Yeah ,
67241	0	a	my first question was does it have to be a a universal remote control ?
67242	0	a	Because we sell it lonely from the t and not with the television , we sell it apart .
67243	0	a	Oh yeah ,
67244	0	a	that is a good question .
67245	0	a	I think it is
67246	0	a	I am not I am not sure ,
67247	0	a	it is not I think
67248	0	a	I do not think you can buy a a a universal remote control for twenty five Euros ,
67249	0	a	so
67250	0	a	not sure ,
67251	0	a	but
67252	0	a	Okay ,
67253	0	a	so
67254	1	a	we we just say we just say that is universal remote control .
67255	0	a	So
67256	0	a	I
67257	0	a	Because
67258	0	a	Yeah ,
67259	0	a	I know you can buy a re a universal control for only twenty Euros
67260	0	a	Yeah , I think .
67261	0	a	Yeah , it probably would be universal .
67262	0	a	Universal .
67263	0	a	And only television ?
67264	0	a	Or more devices ?
67265	0	a	okay .
67266	0	a	, maybe ,
67267	0	a	I do not know .
67268	0	a	Okay , perfect .
67269	0	a	And also for the VCR and DVD player
67270	0	a	and
67271	0	a	okay .
67272	0	a	Yeah , everything
67273	0	a	just
67274	0	a	so a lot of buttons on the remote control .
67275	0	a	Yeah , probably .
67276	0	a	Not just a TV .
67277	0	a	No ,
67278	1	a	just everything .
67279	0	a	Okay .
67280	0	a	Okay .
67281	0	a	so yeah ,
67282	0	a	what what what is a remote control ,
67283	0	a	it is just a black thing with some buttons on it ,
67284	0	a	it is not nothing very special ,
67285	0	a	but
67286	0	a	yeah , that is right .
67287	0	a	Well
67288	1	a	we can try to make it special .
67289	0	a	So
67290	1	a	do you have any ideas how it has to look for for usability
67291	0	a	or user
67292	0	a	yeah .
67293	0	a	Well
67294	0	a	Yeah .
67295	0	a	Well
67296	1	a	I th
67297	1	a	I thought about making it the same style as the television ,
67298	0	a	we do not have the same television all the time , so that is no matter .
67299	1	a	if we control the VCR and the DVD player player with it it has to be clear ,
67300	0	a	because kids and elderly are going to use it ,
67301	0	a	so
67302	0	a	it is not only for the technical persons .
67303	1	a	I think it must be a very good control ,
67304	0	a	so you can act use it from everywhere in your room ,
67305	1	a	the the infrared thing must be from very good quality .
67306	0	a	That is right .
67307	0	a	Should be a good point .
67308	0	a	Okay .
67309	0	a	Nothing N
67310	1	a	It should not be too big ,
67311	0	a	but I do not think we can make it too small , cause it has to have a lot of functions ,
67312	0	a	so .
67313	1	a	And how big should it be ?
67314	0	a	Yeah .
67315	0	a	No .
67316	0	a	Yeah .
67317	0	a	I dunno
67318	0	a	Yes
67319	0	a	that is that is
67320	0	a	right right .
67321	1	a	We ca not make it smaller than the things we see now I think .
67322	1	a	Just big enough for the buttons we have , that is that is it .
67323	0	a	Yeah .
67324	1	a	Or we have to make something like mobile phones that you can fold it opem .
67325	0	a	Yeah .
67326	0	a	Yeah .
67327	0	a	Maybe then you can make it s smaller and uniquer , maybe more trendy .
67328	0	a	But you you you
67329	0	a	you think about one you can fold open .
67330	0	a	Fold open , where you can see more options .
67331	0	a	Okay ,
67332	0	a	yeah , that is cool .
67333	0	a	I think
67334	0	a	Yeah ,
67335	1	a	something on top , just dren general things like volume and TV channels and inside things you do not use that often .
67336	0	a	Yeah
67337	0	a	n
67338	0	a	Yeah ,
67339	0	a	or you c
67340	1	a	O or you could th think of an a small touch screen on the remote control .
67341	1	a	Maybe for the DVD pla player or something ,
67342	0	a	if you just
67343	0	a	Yeah .
67344	0	a	Oh
67345	0	a	that is good , yeah .
67346	0	a	Yeah
67347	0	a	b I wanted
67348	0	a	No
67349	1	a	you can make an manual in it .
67350	0	a	Yeah .
67351	0	a	Why should you use a touchscreen on a remote control ?
67352	0	a	There are buttons on it .
67353	0	a	maybe be it is it is
67354	0	a	Yeah ,
67355	0	a	or maybe to keep it easy and small .
67356	0	a	Okay .
67357	0	a	Yeah ,
67358	0	a	but
67359	0	a	Yeah
67360	0	a	but it is not reachable I think , touch screen .
67361	0	a	But it is not t t t too expensive to put a touchscreen on it .
67362	0	a	But that is
67363	0	a	Yeah , I think it is much too expensive .
67364	0	a	like a a to have
67365	0	a	Yeah , maybe it would .
67366	1	a	And we have to care for the strength of the remote control ,
67367	0	a	because remote controls are most things in the house that falls down on the ground and it get often broken .
67368	0	a	Yeah .
67369	0	a	Yeah .
67370	0	a	So .
67371	0	a	And if you have a touch screen in it , it is definitely too too fragile fragile .
67372	0	a	Yeah , too fragile .
67373	0	a	Yeah
67374	0	a	and a lots lots of kids use it and touchscreen is not kids
67375	1	a	Ma maybe a home station .
67376	0	a	No .
67377	1	a	You can put games on your remote control .
67378	0	a	Kid proof .
67379	1	a	Whatever .
67380	0	a	Yeah .
67381	1	a	And how about the batteries ?
67382	0	a	should you put it in a recharger
67383	0	a	or a just
67384	0	a	yeah .
67385	0	a	Oh
67386	0	a	maybe that is a good idea ,
67387	1	a	just to put it on your television and just s recharge ,
67388	0	a	you never have to use any batteries .
67389	0	a	Yeah .
67390	0	a	Maybe that is a good idea ,
67391	1	a	but yeah , we have to look at the price now I think .
67392	0	a	Yeah ,
67393	0	a	how m how mu how how expensive is a normal recharger ?
67394	0	a	I dunno .
67395	0	a	Yeah .
67396	0	a	Yeah ,
67397	0	a	I dunno .
67398	0	a	Well
67399	0	a	how much is your standards mobile phone recharger ?
67400	0	a	Maybe have
67401	0	a	Yeah ,
67402	0	a	cause well
67403	0	a	Yeah .
67404	0	a	Yeah ,
67405	0	a	if you buy it separately from your phone it is probably expensive , but I do not know what the project projection costs are for such a thing .
67406	0	a	yeah .
67407	1	a	if you th look at the market , it is probably it is still the best way just to put batteries in it ,
67408	0	a	because maybe it is too expensive .
67409	0	a	Yeah .
67410	0	a	Yeah , but a home station is a really good idea ,
67411	0	a	because lots of people are lose their remote control and do not know where it is , and now you can put it always at the same place .
67412	0	a	Yeah , that is right , yeah .
67413	0	a	Yeah .
67414	0	a	Maybe it is
67415	0	a	Therefore it is a good idea , but maybe it is expensive .
67416	1	a	Maybe use it as a separate option .
67417	0	a	Yeah .
67418	1	a	Sell it separately .
67419	0	a	You can
67420	0	a	yeah ,
67421	1	a	you can buy it with it .
67422	0	a	Yeah ,
67423	0	a	but I have a mouse that is also
67424	0	a	Yeah ,
67425	0	a	and and you just have normal batteries that you can recharge and just put it in the station , or you can change your batteries ,
67426	0	a	so .
67427	0	a	Rechargeable .
67428	0	a	Yeah .
67429	0	a	Oh yeah .
67430	0	a	The option , just the option , that is cool .
67431	0	a	Yeah .
67432	0	a	I
67433	0	a	I set something on paper already , size , looks , usable ,
67434	1	a	the buttons on usable places , the the on off button must be on top , it has to lay good in the hand ,
67435	0	a	you you have to
67436	0	a	Yeah ,
67437	0	a	I do not I do not know I do not know
67438	0	a	if we
67439	0	a	You can make it very special , to create our own looks ,
67440	0	a	but it is very hard to
67441	0	a	Nah .
67442	0	a	Yeah .
67443	0	a	Yeah .
67444	0	a	Has it be has
67445	0	a	does it has to b have to be like a different form than a normal remote control
67446	0	a	or
67447	0	a	Yeah
67448	0	a	Yeah .
67449	0	a	Well
67450	1	a	I think we have to look at that ,
67451	0	a	cause well you can do the standard way ,
67452	0	a	but then you wo not
67453	0	a	Well
67454	1	a	you can have the basic things on the same place , like on off button on top and the TV channels one two three four as a block , and then the volume obviously on t on top , so you can see .
67455	0	a	N
67456	0	a	if if we want to make it special , we probably have to do a lot of testing , if it really works .
67457	0	a	Yeah .
67458	0	a	But the rest is you do not use that often ,
67459	1	a	so if you have a clear button with an good icon on it , it should be clear as well .
67460	0	a	Yeah .
67461	0	a	So it does not matter what place it is on the remote control I think ,
67462	1	a	so you can do something unique with that .
67463	0	a	And what we have to think about too is buttons that you use often are maybe like when you fold it open ,
67464	1	a	when you have it closed , you can still do the th the functions .
67465	0	a	Yeah yeah ,
67466	0	a	what Paul already said .
67467	0	a	on on top are the the basic options on top ,
67468	0	a	and if you fold it open
67469	0	a	Yeah .
67470	0	a	Yeah , just for the TV and just the normal function , that is fine .
67471	0	a	But n
67472	0	a	yeah ,
67473	0	a	but i
67474	0	a	basically when I am watching TV
67475	0	a	I am just using like five buttons or so ,
67476	0	a	so .
67477	0	a	Yeah ,
67478	0	a	yeah .
67479	0	a	But maybe it is
67480	0	a	maybe it is very hard to to make it fold open and to l look like it is very
67481	0	a	what is it is called ?
67482	0	a	Maybe it is hard t
67483	0	a	No , that is right .
67484	0	a	Yeah .
67485	0	a	That is what I meant .
67486	0	a	If you if if you make to fold open it is or also an the strength is not s as good as a normal remote control .
67487	0	a	Okay ,
67488	0	a	but yeah .
67489	1	a	So maybe we have to to keep it like a square , just normal remote control .
67490	1	a	Just think about it .
67491	0	a	Yeah .
67492	0	a	We have to close this to finish this meeting ,
67493	0	a	so .
67494	0	a	Okay .
67495	0	a	There is some more things .
67496	0	a	We have another thirty minutes , so then we are going to meet again .
67497	0	a	So you know what you have to what you have to do ?
67498	0	a	Yeah .
67499	0	a	Okay .
67500	0	a	for m for me the Marketing Expert , the user requirements specification , do I need to think as a user ,
67501	0	a	a as a a a only the looks and the
67502	0	a	Okay .
67503	0	a	No ,
67504	1	a	what you want to do with it .
67505	0	a	Yeah ,
67506	1	a	I think this if you you have to

67634	1	a	let is have a look s at this one .
67635	0	a	Okay , so
67636	0	a	the f the f the points we had last meeting was the Should be a univ universal remote control
67637	0	a	No ,
67638	0	a	that is I s
67639	0	a	I just got a email from the from the personal coach and it should be a TV remote control only .
67640	0	a	So
67641	0	a	have you changed that part ?
67642	0	a	so yeah ,
67643	0	a	it still has to be f a r a remote control for kids and elderly .
67644	0	a	Okay .
67645	0	a	It is it is still the same .
67646	0	a	All these points we have to look at .
67647	0	a	You all know them .
67648	0	a	But there is another point .
67649	0	a	The the main people of interest of this company are forty plus people .
67650	0	a	So they are old and not younger people .
67651	1	a	So we have to look at that as well .
67652	1	a	Ispecially old people , maybe bi bigger buttons or something ,
67653	0	a	I dunno .
67654	0	a	Yeah , okay .
67655	0	a	so So
67656	0	a	yeah , that is it ,
67657	1	a	so just you can do your presentation
67658	0	a	for
67659	1	a	Oh it does not matter ,
67660	0	a	just start with the
67661	0	a	I I did not read i read it ,
67662	0	a	so
67663	0	a	it is not for me , I did not get it anyway .
67664	1	a	Which one first ?
67665	0	a	Okay .
67666	0	a	Okay .
67667	0	a	Okay .
67668	1	a	Functional requirements , yeah
67669	0	a	Well
67670	0	a	my name is Jens Damman , but we are in a group ,
67671	1	a	and I I will start it .
67672	0	a	Wait .
67673	0	a	I have used a marketing report on the site .
67674	0	a	I think you have read it too .
67675	0	a	and f and furthermore I surfed the o the other site .
67676	0	a	You did not read it ?
67677	0	a	Oh okay ,
67678	0	a	I I was the only one who get it .
67679	0	a	No , I didn do not thing
67680	0	a	we got it .
67681	0	a	It is only for you .
67682	0	a	Yeah .
67683	0	a	Yes .
67684	0	a	Okay
67685	0	a	it was a report about an experiment with a lot of users .
67686	0	a	And they had a lot of findings in their report with statistical thing with statistical proof .
67687	0	a	So
67688	0	a	I I had three pages with findings and sev a lot of a lot of findings .
67689	1	a	So we can use this to create our own remote control .
67690	0	a	seventy five percent of the users find most remote controls ugly .
67691	0	a	Yeah ,
67692	0	a	I think that is a lot ,
67693	1	a	so we have to make a beautiful remote control .
67694	0	a	eighty percent of users would spend when a remote control will l look fancy .
67695	0	a	I think this fits at the what what Michael said about older people .
67696	0	a	Older people will spend more money for something what is good .
67697	0	a	Because younger people are more critical about where they spend their money money at .
67698	0	a	seventy five percent seventy five percent of the users say they zap a lot .
67699	0	a	Well
67700	0	a	okay , that is normal .
67701	1	a	I think we we have to make good zap buttons .
67702	0	a	But that is one of our requirements .
67703	0	a	The last point is quite an interesting
67704	0	a	So
67705	0	a	if we
67706	0	a	Yeah .
67707	0	a	Yes ,
67708	0	a	fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons .
67709	0	a	Martijn alr already said it .
67710	0	a	And maybe our fold open system is is a good one ,
67711	0	a	but
67712	0	a	I do not think it is reachable .
67713	0	a	Yeah ,
67714	1	a	we should have the ten percent on the on the top ,
67715	0	a	then you are you are
67716	0	a	So
67717	0	a	we have a new age of forty plus .
67718	0	a	Yeah , the ten percent on the top , yeah .
67719	0	a	Yeah .
67720	0	a	That that is a good one .
67721	0	a	page two .
67722	0	a	Remote controls are often lost somewhere in the room .
67723	0	a	That is exactly what we said about maybe a home station for for it to recharge the batteries or something .
67724	1	a	I thought mo maybe we could make a clap system , so when you clap your hands it will beep or something .
67725	0	a	you must find it quickly .
67726	1	a	Maybe just a button on the home station .
67727	1	a	So remote control beeps when you click that button on the home station .
67728	0	a	Okay , yeah .
67729	0	a	Yeah ,
67730	1	a	we can combine that .
67731	0	a	it takes too much time to learn how to use a r new remote control .
67732	1	a	I think we must t take a look at this .
67733	0	a	It is only th thirty four of the thirty four percent .
67734	0	a	But it is a tough one .
67735	0	a	Because if we make a ha whole new product , our own style , we we c this is so difficult , a difficulty I think .
67736	0	a	next , remote controls are bad for RSI .
67737	0	a	Yeah , but only if they zap a lot , and they watch over five hours TV or something .
67738	0	a	I do not
67739	0	a	We we have not
67740	1	a	we must not look too much at the last point .
67741	0	a	Okay ,
67742	0	a	last page .
67743	0	a	the last experiment was about gadgets , like speech recognition .
67744	0	a	We did not think about that already .
67745	0	a	And an LCD on the remote control .
67746	0	a	We already thought about that .
67747	0	a	they finally had a conclusion that younger people under an age of f forty five are more interested in new features .
67748	0	a	And
67749	0	a	but they are more critical .
67750	0	a	And older people want to spend more money .
67751	0	a	But they they do not want to have a lot of new features , because they are in their old thinking way .
67752	0	a	And they want to keep the old things the old things .
67753	0	a	But y But you but you already said that the company was about forty plus clients ?
67754	1	a	I I think we can speak , we can skip speech recognition directly ,
67755	0	a	because it is not reachable for twenty five Euros .
67756	0	a	People .
67757	0	a	So
67758	0	a	yeah ,
67759	1	a	so we just can skip the LCD r on the remote control ,
67760	0	a	because
67761	0	a	Yeah .
67762	0	a	Yeah .
67763	0	a	It is too
67764	0	a	Okay .
67765	0	a	Yeah .
67766	1	a	then I have my personal preference .
67767	0	a	Okay ,
67768	0	a	that is not very good ,
67769	0	a	because I thought about television , DVD player , stereo and VCR .
67770	0	a	I had a question about .
67771	0	a	But it is already out of the question , this .
67772	0	a	my point is , well , I If we ma make a a remote control for only television , I think it is hard to sell it for twenty five Euros .
67773	0	a	But it is the exercise .
67774	0	a	Because it is too expensive .
67775	0	a	Yeah , only only for television
67776	0	a	On the market you can now buy for twenty Euros a remote control for everything .
67777	0	a	Yeah , probably .
67778	0	a	And we only make it for television ,
67779	1	a	so we mi we m must made it make it very special .
67780	0	a	Yeah ,
67781	1	a	but good usability ,
67782	0	a	so you can use it .
67783	0	a	Okay ,
67784	0	a	I told about the home station .
67785	1	a	it must be simple ,
67786	0	a	because our the the elderly people needs to use it .
67787	0	a	And I I found a motto .
67788	0	a	And we put the fashion in electronics .
67789	0	a	And that is the motto we are referenced to for our our style .
67790	0	a	We we have to make a a new product .
67791	0	a	We have to be Yeah .
67792	0	a	One of a kind , I think .
67793	0	a	So it has to look unique ,
67794	0	a	but
67795	0	a	Yeah .
67796	0	a	Unique .
67797	0	a	The company is about our th th their own fashion , their own style .
67798	0	a	Yeah , I reckon
67799	0	a	I think
67800	0	a	Yeah .
67801	0	a	But old people are not looking for that .
67802	0	a	Not really .
67803	0	a	Yeah .
67804	1	a	I think the main thing is the usability , that is where we can make it a special product .
67805	0	a	Yeah ,
67806	0	a	to k to keep it simple when you
67807	0	a	Sorry
67808	0	a	I thought about it , yes .
67809	0	a	Okay .
67810	0	a	Yeah .
67811	1	a	But we also have to stand out ,
67812	0	a	cause there are already , like you said , so many controls out that support lot of stuff .
67813	0	a	Yeah .
67814	1	a	But we have to make sure that we are better usability , and stand out by just looks of it .
67815	1	a	So make it just a different colour or different shape ,
67816	0	a	so
67817	0	a	Okay .
67818	0	a	Yeah .
67819	0	a	Okay .
67820	0	a	Okay ,
67821	0	a	this was my presentation .
67822	0	a	Thanks .
67823	0	a	Okay .
67824	0	a	I do not
67825	0	a	Yeah .
67826	0	a	So
67827	1	a	Paul , you can do the next one if you want .
67828	1	a	You can ask some questions or something .
67829	0	a	Yeah well .
67830	0	a	It is on the on the net net thing ,
67831	0	a	is not it ?
67832	0	a	So
67833	1	a	what do you think of only the numbers and the on off button or
67834	0	a	Okay .
67835	0	a	There it is .
67836	0	a	Okay .
67837	0	a	Technical functions design .
67838	0	a	Okay , well , so
67839	0	a	we have s broad audience .
67840	0	a	Is not that is not true anymore .
67841	0	a	But we have elderly people , so we need to keep it simple .
67842	1	a	the way I want to keep it simple is to use the sen standard .
67843	1	a	So standardised methods like on all remote controls .
67844	1	a	Not too full ,
67845	0	a	like Jens already said , only ten percent is being used .
67846	0	a	Yeah ,
67847	0	a	I have it on the next page .
67848	1	a	But yes basic functions like numbers and that sort of stuff .
67849	0	a	so
67850	1	a	the options that we put on there should be easy to use ,
67851	0	a	and cause you have more room then ,
67852	1	a	and for elderly people big buttons .
67853	1	a	an icon on it or text on it ,
67854	0	a	so it is very clear what that buttons does .
67855	0	a	So it does not take much time to figure out how to use it .
67856	0	a	a way to find out what people use is maybe just to use questionnaires on the internet or just ask some random people , elderly people what they use , what they want on a remote control to find out .
67857	0	a	Yeah .
67858	0	a	But there is already in a one done .
67859	0	a	Of functions I could think of .
67860	0	a	volume , channels , the the basic according to .
67861	0	a	Just one two three etcetera .
67862	0	a	text service options .
67863	0	a	basic on off .
67864	0	a	And I found an
67865	1	a	Could I think of favourites ?
67866	0	a	I always look up the same pages on text and always have to click the number .
67867	0	a	Okay .
67868	1	a	But if you could make a new option , that you just have to press one button
67869	0	a	and you get on your No y
67870	0	a	Well
67871	0	a	it is
67872	0	a	It was just a thought .
67873	0	a	Yeah ,
67874	0	a	but then you have to remember what favourite is what channel .
67875	0	a	So you might as well remember the number .
67876	0	a	Or not ?
67877	0	a	Yeah , okay .
67878	0	a	Maybe i maybe it is too complicated , but not sure .
67879	0	a	It is a good idea ,
67880	0	a	but mayb for me
67881	0	a	it is
67882	0	a	If I use my telephone , I never use those buttons to to to call
67883	0	a	sh
67884	0	a	Never .
67885	0	a	So
67886	0	a	I am , I u
67887	0	a	I would find it handy , I think , when you just press one button
67888	0	a	and you get on six six six .
67889	0	a	But how can you remember what channel connects to what favourite button ?
67890	0	a	Yeah ?
67891	0	a	Yeah okay .
67892	0	a	Well
67893	0	a	what I was reading on the page .
67894	0	a	a remote control just sends commands , basics commands to the television .
67895	0	a	So
67896	0	a	switch to channel six .
67897	0	a	So
67898	0	a	button six says says six .
67899	0	a	And if you make favourites , it can say six six six in a row .
67900	0	a	Just numbers .
67901	0	a	That can be in the in the
67902	0	a	Well
67903	0	a	if you said a favourite
67904	0	a	Well
67905	0	a	i
67906	0	a	Never ?
67907	0	a	Oh .
67908	0	a	But for a user to to remember , if I press that button it goes to that channel .
67909	0	a	Yeah ,
67910	0	a	but is not it hard to remember ?
67911	0	a	Like favourite one and
67912	0	a	No , neither do I .
67913	0	a	Oh are you ?
67914	0	a	Okay now ,
67915	0	a	m maybe not .
67916	0	a	So
67917	0	a	And
67918	0	a	If I do not do it , maybe old people
67919	0	a	It is not , it is still not It is not anymore n Just on the front as well .
67920	0	a	No ,
67921	0	a	maybe elderly people .
67922	0	a	Yeah ,
67923	0	a	I dunno .
67924	0	a	Right .
67925	0	a	They do not like new features .
67926	0	a	So maybe not .
67927	0	a	well
67928	0	a	play , pause .
67929	0	a	I dunno if that is usable
67930	0	a	when
67931	0	a	Not anymore for TV .
67932	0	a	Right ,
67933	0	a	on off .
67934	0	a	I dunno ,
67935	0	a	miss
67936	0	a	Did I miss any other buttons , basic buttons ?
67937	0	a	I could not think of any other , ispecially not for TV .
67938	0	a	Forward .
67939	0	a	No ,
67940	0	a	that is the only th the only thing you need .
67941	0	a	Is Just the channel What I mean is
67942	0	a	Six seven eight or five .
67943	0	a	the p next and previous .
67944	0	a	Previous I know ,
67945	0	a	but next channel ?
67946	0	a	I do not thi
67947	0	a	Li like a web browser ,
67948	0	a	so
67949	0	a	Oh , okay .
67950	0	a	Just very simple .
67951	1	a	But there is also a button to go to the channel you have been before .
67952	0	a	Like a web browser back button .
67953	0	a	I dunno .
67954	0	a	Yeah ,
67955	0	a	I know what it is ,
67956	0	a	but I think it is all too difficult for old people .
67957	0	a	I do not have I did
67958	0	a	Yeah ,
67959	0	a	I do not think you use that .
67960	0	a	No .
67961	0	a	It gets some seconds .
67962	0	a	Yeah ,
67963	0	a	okay .
67964	0	a	Y only when you want to go to
67965	0	a	Yeah ,
67966	0	a	just use when you want to switch between channels all the time .
67967	1	a	And how do you want to do it , like if you have a channel above ten ?
67968	0	a	Normally you can press one , zero or
67969	0	a	A ten plus
67970	0	a	or
67971	0	a	Okay .
67972	0	a	Yeah .
67973	0	a	Yeah ,
67974	1	a	I think f Especially for older peo elderly people use standard buttons .
67975	0	a	So you have that
67976	0	a	Yeah , the ten plus button .
67977	1	a	Just one one pressing , or quickly after each other .
67978	0	a	To just keep it simple and standard features .
67979	0	a	Yeah ,
67980	0	a	w would not it be a problem to Because you h have to be fast enough .
67981	0	a	Maybe the elderly people
67982	0	a	Oh okay .
67983	0	a	yeah
67984	0	a	mayb
67985	0	a	But I think that is in the TV as well .
67986	0	a	That is how the the TV TV handles it .
67987	1	a	But you can have a button that says two two st two stripes .
67988	0	a	Yeah ,
67989	0	a	it is it is no it is not a
67990	0	a	It is what Paul says .
67991	0	a	Yeah .
67992	0	a	So you have like a five seconds period to press those two buttons .
67993	0	a	Yeah ,
67994	0	a	but that is th
67995	0	a	Okay .
67996	0	a	It is not a remote control that makes the TV do one two .
67997	0	a	It is the TV who depends that it must be two seconds or three seconds or one second that you must type one or two .
67998	0	a	So if you have a universal TV controller , you needed one button that has two stripes .
67999	0	a	Yeah .
68000	0	a	Yeah .
68001	0	a	So we have a a period of , I dunno , five seconds to press those buttons , and that And not for elderly people to look , one two press and aim and
68002	0	a	So I I do not think so .
68003	0	a	Yeah .
68004	0	a	But do we still need a two level remote control ?
68005	0	a	Because if we only have that l only f
68006	0	a	No .
68007	0	a	It is only for television now .
68008	0	a	No .
68009	0	a	I just thought of another one .
68010	0	a	Most things in modern TVs are also on the menu .
68011	0	a	Yeah .
68012	1	a	So you also need a menu button .
68013	1	a	And then navigation
68014	0	a	But we can integrate that with volume and previous and next ,
68015	0	a	so you have four arrows .
68016	0	a	Yeah .
68017	1	a	I
68018	1	a	I think you ha really have to divide between functions you often use , like m maybe switch channels and volume and k that kind of things , and the menu button .
68019	0	a	Because you n almost never use menu button .
68020	0	a	Yeah , okay ,
68021	0	a	but
68022	0	a	Yeah , a mute button .
68023	0	a	So
68024	0	a	Okay .
68025	0	a	Maybe it is still still a good idea , I am not sure .
68026	1	a	You will also have to use a mute button
68027	0	a	to to Maybe , not
68028	1	a	I do not know where where you have to put it .
68029	0	a	Yes .
68030	0	a	Do not think so .
68031	0	a	Yeah well ,
68032	0	a	that is that is
68033	0	a	I think that is the layers that produce .
68034	1	a	Now I have to figure out what is what to put on .
68035	0	a	Okay .
68036	1	a	What we are going to use .
68037	0	a	Yeah .
68038	0	a	Yeah .
68039	0	a	That is right .
68040	1	a	And later we can d do the design .
68041	0	a	Okay ,
68042	1	a	now my personal preferences .
68043	1	a	using the standards , basic I think that we should stand out unique , being unique with the design .
68044	1	a	So we have to , I dunno , make a different shape than usual .
68045	0	a	So when you are in the shop and you see our TV controller hanging , that it stands out .
68046	0	a	Not just in in the row when you see all the same remote controls .
68047	0	a	Yeah .
68048	0	a	Does it have to be it has to be with different colours
68049	0	a	or
68050	1	a	It is like a iMac or something .
68051	0	a	I dunno .
68052	0	a	Different colours
68053	0	a	Yeah .
68054	0	a	Maybe we can give it out in different colours .
68055	1	a	You can choose blue or yellow
68056	0	a	or
68057	0	a	That is fa That is fancy .
68058	0	a	Just to make it
68059	0	a	But it looks cheap as well ,
68060	0	a	because it is a small thing .
68061	0	a	Well
68062	0	a	why not ?
68063	0	a	Or Yeah .
68064	0	a	That is fashion .
68065	0	a	It is only twenty five Euros .
68066	0	a	It looks very cheap if you make it
68067	0	a	Oh ,
68068	0	a	you just
68069	0	a	I dunno what happened .
68070	0	a	Well ,
68071	1	a	maybe you can look at mobile phones .
68072	0	a	Oh .
68073	0	a	Who ?
68074	0	a	They they are designed very well .
68075	0	a	Yeah , we have to look at mobile phones , that is right .
68076	0	a	Just
68077	0	a	Yeah .
68078	0	a	And well basically are the same , just a bit smaller .
68079	0	a	You think you ca not make a TV controller too small , cause then you will always lo always lose it .
68080	0	a	Yeah .
68081	0	a	But well , I think that is a good example .
68082	0	a	Okay .
68083	0	a	Okay ,
68084	1	a	we hurry up a bit ,
68085	0	a	because otherwise we wo not make it .
68086	0	a	Okay ,
68087	0	a	sorry .
68088	0	a	Is it fin
68089	0	a	Are you finished ?
68090	0	a	Okay .
68091	0	a	Well
68092	0	a	Yeah , I I am finished .
68093	0	a	I think we discussed everything .
68094	0	a	Okay .
68095	0	a	Well ,
68096	0	a	the working design .
68097	0	a	The method I used is search the web .
68098	0	a	Just the web page provided .
68099	0	a	Basically
68100	0	a	I am I am not very technical educated , but I could figure it out .
68101	0	a	basically what happens is you press a button , then a circuit gets closed by pressing the button , like a switch .
68102	0	a	And by closing that certain circuit , the chip knows what bu button is pressed .
68103	0	a	So
68104	0	a	like you press a one , that circuit is closed
68105	0	a	and
68106	0	a	Then the chip produces a pattern .
68107	0	a	Like a Morse code
68108	0	a	to
68109	0	a	And and sends that to the LED .
68110	0	a	That is the light emitting diode , I think .
68111	0	a	and the light emitting diode is producing infrared light .
68112	0	a	That is un invisible to the human eye .
68113	0	a	And transmit that to the TV .
68114	0	a	However it has also an a visible diode that is blinking red if you look in it .
68115	0	a	And that is another diode , I believe .
68116	0	a	Because infrared is not visible .
68117	0	a	So
68118	0	a	that is er do two different things
68119	0	a	but
68120	0	a	Yeah .
68121	0	a	So
68122	0	a	we we also have to have a LED li LED light on it ?
68123	0	a	Yeah ,
68124	1	a	it is I think it is usable .
68125	0	a	I I think so .
68126	0	a	j Is
68127	0	a	Ai not it just to to indicate that it is transmitting ?
68128	0	a	So
68129	0	a	Yeah .
68130	0	a	I I am not sure if it is the same thing .
68131	0	a	Yeah , that is active .
68132	0	a	Yeah .
68133	0	a	Yeah .
68134	1	a	Or just a green one ,
68135	0	a	because it is If you use it , it is green or the red , it is r green .
68136	0	a	Maybe Maybe depends on
68137	0	a	Yes .
68138	0	a	I I think it is in the case that it is active .
68139	0	a	It is not I it is it is just
68140	0	a	the the
68141	0	a	Yeah , when you press it .
68142	0	a	Yeah , that is right .
68143	0	a	But if you
68144	1	a	Red is l shows up like something is wrong , and green is like it is okay , you press the button .
68145	0	a	So
68146	0	a	Two ?
68147	0	a	Yeah ,
68148	0	a	I dunno .
68149	0	a	Ma on on most
68150	0	a	on most remote controls it is red .
68151	0	a	Yeah , I know .
68152	0	a	So
68153	0	a	So
68154	0	a	I know .
68155	0	a	Yeah .
68156	0	a	Okay , we make it red .
68157	0	a	But maybe
68158	0	a	Well
68159	0	a	we do not have to make it red .
68160	1	a	Maybe integrate it in the design as well .
68161	0	a	You have to
68162	1	a	The whole the whole remote control becomes green if you press the buttons .
68163	0	a	that is cool .
68164	0	a	Oh ,
68165	0	a	maybe it is it is would an e No .
68166	0	a	I I think the batteries will be a little
68167	0	a	Yeah , okay .
68168	0	a	Just
68169	0	a	Oh .
68170	0	a	No ,
68171	0	a	we have a recharger in it ,
68172	0	a	so If we can still make that then
68173	0	a	But it is cool if it was green .
68174	0	a	Empty .
68175	0	a	maybe .
68176	0	a	Yeah ,
68177	0	a	but it does not have to be red .
68178	0	a	It is just to indicate something is on .
68179	0	a	Yeah .
68180	0	a	Yeah .
68181	0	a	That it is working .
68182	0	a	That it is not not the batteries are low .
68183	0	a	Yeah .
68184	0	a	It is it is not very important ,
68185	0	a	so yeah .
68186	0	a	Green or red or whatever , it is cool .
68187	0	a	Yeah , I know .
68188	0	a	Just to indicate it is working .
68189	0	a	So So
68190	0	a	we have to make buttons for that as well ,
68191	0	a	to make it
68192	0	a	Okay .
68193	0	a	And the receptor in the TV senses the pattern .
68194	0	a	So we have to understand what patterns are used to , you know , to make it universal .
68195	0	a	So that it can be used with all the TVs .
68196	0	a	We have to really understand what patterns are used ,
68197	0	a	so we can o
68198	0	a	On the
68199	0	a	Otherwise it wo not work .
68200	0	a	No .
68201	0	a	I I
68202	0	a	The chip is producing the pattern .
68203	0	a	So we have to make a chip that produces patterns to , y you know , to
68204	0	a	Yeah .
68205	0	a	An automatically search function for each television , or something .
68206	0	a	That are working .
68207	0	a	Yeah ,
68208	0	a	or
68209	0	a	I dunno how it is exactly how it works .
68210	0	a	It was not explained there .
68211	0	a	Well ,
68212	0	a	I
68213	0	a	I use a universal remote control , and list of all the TVs you have , etcetera .
68214	0	a	I kno
68215	0	a	Oh ,
68216	0	a	I have a modern one .
68217	0	a	And you have to put in a number , so it works on your TV .
68218	0	a	Yeah ?
68219	0	a	Okay .
68220	0	a	And the modern one you you you type search , and the LED began to blink blink blink .
68221	0	a	And after a short time the television turns off .
68222	0	a	And then you know , oh it it is the right one .
68223	0	a	And you can stop it , and then it is okay .
68224	0	a	okay .
68225	0	a	So you do not have to search for your television or your code .
68226	0	a	Okay .
68227	0	a	It search the pattern for itself .
68228	0	a	Okay , yeah .
68229	0	a	Okay ,
68230	1	a	so we use that .
68231	0	a	So
68232	0	a	it
68233	1	a	We have to make a a s a bit more intelligent chip than the standard one .
68234	0	a	Yes .
68235	0	a	Because you have to
68236	0	a	Yeah .
68237	0	a	Yep .
68238	0	a	I just say
68239	0	a	Can you s just say it again ,
68240	0	a	because I was just looking
68241	0	a	There is just a short
68242	0	a	Yeah .
68243	0	a	okay .
68244	0	a	Well
68245	0	a	y you have this chip .
68246	0	a	That is when the circuit is closed , it produces the pattern .
68247	0	a	But ma basically for brands of TV these patterns are different .
68248	0	a	So like when you press a one on one TV it go go to one .
68249	0	a	And on the other TV it wo not work , basically .
68250	0	a	So basically
68251	0	a	what you have to do is get these patterns right .
68252	0	a	Yeah .
68253	0	a	And by d
68254	0	a	that can be done by just cha
68255	0	a	yeah ,
68256	0	a	changing this pattern all the time .
68257	0	a	Changing the signal .
68258	0	a	And What he is doing when he is configuring this pattern , this chip , is trying to switch off the television .
68259	0	a	And when it is switched off , you can push a button as it is working now ,
68260	0	a	so
68261	0	a	And then he saves that setting and then it is working .
68262	0	a	Okay .
68263	0	a	Yeah .
68264	0	a	Yeah , that is the right option .
68265	0	a	Okay .
68266	0	a	Well
68267	0	a	the components .
68268	0	a	Yeah ,
68269	0	a	that is a bit technical ,
68270	0	a	and I had not I w
68271	0	a	I was a little short on time .
68272	0	a	but I think I understand it .
68273	0	a	the energy source is the battery , basically .
68274	0	a	Yeah .
68275	0	a	that is connecting to all the components .
68276	0	a	Because it has to be fed with energy .
68277	0	a	Okay .
68278	0	a	the subcomponent is w
68279	0	a	I
68280	0	a	I think it is the button pressed .
68281	0	a	So basically
68282	0	a	when you press a button , a switch get closed .
68283	0	a	that is connecting to a chip .
68284	0	a	So the chip knows what button you pressed .
68285	0	a	And the chip sends out the pattern to the infrared bulb .
68286	0	a	I didn did not put the description by this one .
68287	0	a	Th this is a normal bulb .
68288	0	a	So the normal flashing light .
68289	0	a	Okay .
68290	0	a	So that is the LED , LED .
68291	0	a	Yeah .
68292	0	a	Yeah , and this is a LED too .
68293	0	a	But this one is producing infrared light that is invisible .
68294	0	a	Yeah , okay .
68295	0	a	And this one is producing normal light .
68296	0	a	So
68297	0	a	we can make the normal one also a normal light .
68298	0	a	Not a LED light , but as a normal one .
68299	0	a	Yeah
68300	0	a	Yeah ,
68301	0	a	presu
68302	0	a	Yeah
68303	0	a	yeah
68304	0	a	yeah .
68305	0	a	To flash up your
68306	0	a	Yeah .
68307	0	a	if you if you use the buttons , both of them works .
68308	0	a	But one you ca not see and one indicates that you use a button .
68309	0	a	Because when you button press a button and it does not work , it can
68310	0	a	Basically
68311	0	a	if the battery is low , it wo not work .
68312	0	a	Yeah .
68313	0	a	Yeah ,
68314	0	a	and
68315	0	a	I think it is unnecessary power you use then .
68316	0	a	Huh , that is a good idea .
68317	1	a	Maybe you have to put a small light around the button you push .
68318	0	a	So you see green if you push that button .
68319	0	a	Yeah ,
68320	0	a	but if you u if you do that , you know that you are sending a signal .
68321	0	a	No , y
68322	0	a	Yeah .
68323	0	a	Okay .
68324	0	a	And it is you also know which button you p
68325	0	a	Yeah , that is right .
68326	0	a	But then have to be on the in the all remote control have to be LEDs .
68327	0	a	But it
68328	0	a	But does it make any difference for the energy you use ?
68329	0	a	You got still one LED .
68330	0	a	Everywhere in the r
68331	0	a	Is LEDs beneath the the buttons ?
68332	0	a	Yeah , okay .
68333	0	a	No I do not think so ,
68334	0	a	but
68335	0	a	Yeah ,
68336	0	a	i it
68337	0	a	it will look different ,
68338	1	a	and I think we need to find something else .
68339	0	a	That looks different , yeah .
68340	0	a	Yeah .
68341	0	a	Cause otherwise we will just make another standard ,
68342	0	a	and our motto also is
68343	0	a	Yeah , w around the buttons , or in the buttons even .
68344	0	a	Yeah ,
68345	0	a	but like when you push it
68346	0	a	n n
68347	0	a	Yeah .
68348	0	a	Yeah ,
68349	0	a	then then wo not Then you wo not see it .
68350	0	a	You have your finger over the button .
68351	0	a	So you can see
68352	0	a	Yeah .
68353	1	a	It must be around it then .
68354	1	a	Or or m maybe on top of the A green light is flashing
68355	0	a	or
68356	0	a	Yeah .
68357	0	a	Yeah ,
68358	0	a	then
68359	0	a	Yeah .
68360	0	a	Not not not not here , but here .
68361	0	a	There .
68362	0	a	Yeah .
68363	0	a	Maybe
68364	0	a	Okay .
68365	0	a	The same as a telephone , or a mobile phone , or what do you mean ?
68366	0	a	If you push
68367	0	a	It lights up .
68368	0	a	Yeah , we are thinking about it .
68369	0	a	on a mobile phone , in the dark everything lights up .
68370	0	a	Everything lights up .
68371	0	a	That is a good idea .
68372	0	a	Yeah .
68373	1	a	Why ai not that on a remote control ?
68374	0	a	Yeah ,
68375	0	a	if a mobile phone a phone can do it , it is
68376	0	a	Yeah ,
68377	0	a	i if you are in the dark , you ca not see the remote .
68378	0	a	It it only takes a l a little energy and it is not that much .
68379	0	a	Yeah .
68380	0	a	It is f
68381	0	a	Yeah .
68382	0	a	Maybe that is a good idea for old people as well .
68383	1	a	It is only few LEDs .
68384	0	a	Yeah .
68385	1	a	Only four or something .
68386	1	a	Four LED .
68387	0	a	No ,
68388	0	a	I dunno .
68389	0	a	But if we use a battery station ,
68390	1	a	which I think we will use
68391	0	a	Yep .
68392	0	a	Yeah ,
68393	0	a	I
68394	0	a	Yeah .
68395	0	a	Yeah , that is a good idea , okay .
68396	0	a	Yeah .
68397	0	a	We will have enough power
68398	0	a	to
68399	0	a	Yeah .
68400	0	a	Everything agre
68401	0	a	Everyone agrees with that ,
68402	0	a	or
68403	0	a	Okay .
68404	1	a	Maybe what Paul said , under the on the on the home station , a button to to call your remote control , that it beeps .
68405	0	a	Yeah ,
68406	0	a	and then you
68407	0	a	Okay , yeah .
68408	0	a	And also it is
68409	0	a	Okay ,
68410	0	a	it should not take much
68411	0	a	I th
68412	0	a	I think you also have remote controls with a lot of options .
68413	0	a	But you have to make a sound device in it then .
68414	0	a	Yeah , there must be sound in it .
68415	0	a	But
68416	0	a	Yeah .
68417	0	a	I dunno .
68418	0	a	Yeah .
68419	0	a	B
68420	0	a	maybe it is that that is a little too hard to make .
68421	0	a	Especially for that kind of money .
68422	0	a	Because it is i it has to be
68423	0	a	Yeah .
68424	0	a	twenty five Euros , I think we can make it .
68425	0	a	Production cost is
68426	0	a	t twelve and a half .
68427	0	a	Bec
68428	0	a	Twelve and a half , okay .
68429	0	a	But but we only have to make it for television ,
68430	1	a	and we must have something special .
68431	0	a	Yeah , okay .
68432	0	a	So
68433	0	a	But we lose about ninety percent of those options .
68434	0	a	So I think you can
68435	0	a	Yeah .
68436	1	a	We have to give our customers some extras .
68437	0	a	Yeah , okay .
68438	0	a	I think we will save money with that .
68439	0	a	Okay .
68440	0	a	Are you almost finished
68441	0	a	or just
68442	0	a	Okay .
68443	0	a	Yeah , the the personal preference , I did not fill it out .
68444	0	a	Because I was short on time .
68445	0	a	Okay .
68446	0	a	No worry .
68447	0	a	But
68448	1	a	Basically what we could do too is have a Bluetooth integration .
68449	0	a	Yeah ,
68450	1	a	I just want to talk some about some more .
68451	0	a	So maybe you have to
68452	0	a	Yeah ?
68453	0	a	Okay .
68454	0	a	Yeah ?
68455	0	a	Okay .
68456	0	a	So
68457	0	a	this
68458	0	a	Oh , sorry .
68459	0	a	Wh what is that ?
68460	0	a	So
68461	0	a	Oh , sorry .
68462	0	a	We have some new project requirements .
68463	1	a	We have to have a look what they are .
68464	0	a	They are still in
68465	0	a	teletext has become outdated since the popularity of internet .
68466	0	a	So a teletext option , maybe we have to skip that one .
68467	0	a	I am not sure .
68468	0	a	I do not think so ,
68469	0	a	but
68470	0	a	Yeah ,
68471	0	a	and it is it is on your comp it is on your television .
68472	0	a	No ,
68473	0	a	and I I think a lot of people use teletext , still use .
68474	0	a	No .
68475	0	a	It is only one button .
68476	0	a	So I do not think it is
68477	1	a	We definitely should use it .
68478	0	a	Yeah .
68479	0	a	Yeah ,
68480	0	a	that is what I told you .
68481	0	a	The remote control should only be used for a television .
68482	0	a	So
68483	0	a	that is maybe easier .
68484	0	a	And the the forty plus people , I already told you .
68485	0	a	Oh
68486	0	a	no ,
68487	0	a	sorry .
68488	0	a	Oh , this is a problem .
68489	0	a	Oh sorry about that .
68490	0	a	The new product should reach a new market with customers are the younger than forty .
68491	1	a	So it should be flashy or just more interesting .
68492	0	a	Okay .
68493	0	a	Oh .
68494	0	a	Okay ,
68495	0	a	that is It changes things .
68496	0	a	I am sorry about that .
68497	0	a	I just I just did not read it well .
68498	0	a	So
68499	0	a	does it make some decision about that ?
68500	0	a	That still stays .
68501	0	a	Changes .
68502	0	a	Well yeah ,
68503	1	a	then we have to make some nice features .
68504	0	a	Yeah .
68505	0	a	That kind of changes the whole situation .
68506	0	a	LCD does not work for twelve and a half Euros I think .
68507	0	a	I think the thing in the dark is a good way , to make it more like a mobile phone .
68508	0	a	Yeah .
68509	0	a	More modern .
68510	0	a	Yeah .
68511	0	a	That is important I think
68512	0	a	and
68513	0	a	And I d I do not do not think it is very usable in a remote control ,
68514	0	a	especially when you only have TV functions on it .
68515	0	a	Oh .
68516	0	a	Yeah .
68517	0	a	I I do not y
68518	0	a	you will use it often ,
68519	0	a	because you can see on the television wh what channel you
68520	0	a	No .
68521	0	a	So
68522	0	a	Yeah , I tho I think that is not usable .
68523	0	a	Oh , I am watching the channel one .
68524	0	a	Okay .
68525	0	a	No , it is not
68526	0	a	But some of you had something to read about speech recognition .
68527	0	a	So ,
68528	0	a	but Yeah .
68529	1	a	What other features can we put in ?
68530	0	a	It is very fashion .
68531	0	a	Yeah .
68532	1	a	I think you you have to make it a bit flashy and and popular .
68533	1	a	And then the usability is not that required ,
68534	0	a	because the Like in the mobile phones , usability is not that good I think .
68535	0	a	About you said one and the television turns on one .
68536	0	a	Is that reachable maybe ?
68537	0	a	That is very That is fancy .
68538	0	a	I did not read I did not read any
68539	0	a	b
68540	0	a	Yeah .
68541	0	a	That is cool .
68542	0	a	Twelve and you have got twelve .
68543	0	a	Yeah okay .
68544	1	a	Only the numbers , only numbers .
68545	0	a	I I know .
68546	1	a	furthermore nothing .
68547	1	a	But only the numbers , one to twenty or something .
68548	0	a	That should be cool .
68549	0	a	Yeah , maybe we have to integrate that as well .
68550	0	a	If it is possible .
68551	0	a	If it is possible ,
68552	0	a	I dunno .
68553	0	a	But
68554	0	a	I do not think it is very expensive actually .
68555	0	a	Yeah ,
68556	0	a	I do not know .
68557	0	a	I did not read it .
68558	0	a	Why should it ?
68559	0	a	You only have a microphone in it .
68560	0	a	if i if i
68561	0	a	I did not have information about that .
68562	0	a	Yeah , I think it is
68563	0	a	What
68564	0	a	But I dunno how that works then .
68565	0	a	Yeah .
68566	0	a	But it has to work .
68567	1	a	And and and does it have to work only in English , or in Dutch too or
68568	0	a	And and w Yeah ?
68569	0	a	Yeah ,
68570	1	a	it is probably my job to figure that out ,
68571	0	a	but
68572	0	a	And and do you have to speak in in like in a thing
68573	0	a	or
68574	0	a	Yeah ,
68575	0	a	I dunno .
68576	0	a	Nah , maybe Maybe maybe it is too hard to to realise that .
68577	0	a	that is a problem ,
68578	0	a	but
68579	1	a	only in English .
68580	1	a	Only in English I think .
68581	0	a	does your
68582	0	a	Does it lie in the centre of the room and can you scream from wherever one to have in channel one ?
68583	0	a	Yeah ,
68584	0	a	I dunno .
68585	0	a	No ,
68586	0	a	that
68587	0	a	Yeah ,
68588	1	a	then th we have to think about that .
68589	0	a	But do do we do it ?
68590	0	a	It is more if we if we do it .
68591	0	a	So ,
68592	0	a	is it very usable ?
68593	0	a	That is what I am looking at .
68594	0	a	Yeah .
68595	0	a	Is
68596	0	a	Yeah well
68597	0	a	It is I d
68598	0	a	Yeah .
68599	0	a	It
68600	0	a	We have short time to to put it on the market ,
68601	0	a	so that
68602	0	a	We have to do a lot of testing before we can do that .
68603	0	a	Okay .
68604	0	a	Yeah , I think so .
68605	1	a	We make make , we can make th th the new remote control very flashy .
68606	0	a	Yeah ,
68607	0	a	and and
68608	0	a	In indeed the languages are a difficult thing .
68609	0	a	because we we have a lot of languages .
68610	0	a	Yeah .
68611	0	a	I do not think it is useful enough to take the effort to design something with speech recognition .
68612	0	a	And and
68613	0	a	Yeah ,
68614	1	a	and also if if you have a good speech speech recognition , you can just throw the the remote away .
68615	0	a	Yeah .
68616	0	a	I think so .
68617	0	a	Yeah .
68618	0	a	A someone says that give me one Coke , and the TV turns to one .
68619	0	a	Yeah ,
68620	0	a	it is not
68621	0	a	Okay ,
68622	0	a	but th that becomes your f
68623	0	a	because that is very hard for speech recognition .
68624	0	a	Yeah .
68625	0	a	Yeah , okay .
68626	0	a	Well yeah ,
68627	0	a	that is the right command .
68628	1	a	And then you have to say TV channel one , or something .
68629	0	a	But
68630	0	a	yeah , TV one .
68631	1	a	Not just one ,
68632	0	a	but
68633	0	a	Well
68634	0	a	I dunno .
68635	0	a	Yeah .
68636	0	a	But I do not think , it just ai not useful enough .
68637	0	a	So
68638	1	a	we have to make some decisions .
68639	0	a	So
68640	0	a	you can see on the
68641	0	a	So
68642	1	a	we have to know what we are going to put on .
68643	0	a	Okay , no speech recognition .
68644	0	a	Do we , do we make a light under the under the n under the numbers and everything ?
68645	0	a	Do
68646	1	a	If you press something , it lights up for a few seconds ,
68647	0	a	so you can see what other but buttons there are ,
68648	0	a	okay ?
68649	0	a	Okay , we just take that one .
68650	0	a	Yeah , I think so .
68651	0	a	Yeah , that is good .
68652	0	a	Yep .
68653	0	a	And what else , we have
68654	0	a	Yeah ,
68655	0	a	but it is
68656	0	a	Oh th I thought would , that that would be the same .
68657	0	a	Also the one in the dark .
68658	0	a	So
68659	0	a	It lights up when it is dark ?
68660	0	a	I did not
68661	0	a	Okay .
68662	1	a	If you push something , it it all lights up .
68663	0	a	Yeah .
68664	0	a	Yeah yeah ,
68665	1	a	it it must not work all the time .
68666	0	a	Yeah ,
68667	0	a	but
68668	0	a	Yes , that is what I mean .
68669	1	a	It it have to work only when you use it .
68670	0	a	So if you
68671	0	a	No ,
68672	1	a	if you use one button , it must turn on for twenty seconds , and then it must turn off .
68673	1	a	Or you can switch it on or something .
68674	0	a	Or maybe when you
68675	0	a	yeah .
68676	1	a	It lights up all .
68677	0	a	Yeah , that is right .
68678	0	a	You have to
68679	0	a	Yeah , that is right .
68680	0	a	That is what I said .
68681	0	a	Okay yeah .
68682	1	a	It is the same as the telephone .
68683	0	a	D
68684	0	a	Yeah , alright .
68685	1	a	Yeah .
68686	0	a	Yeah .
68687	0	a	And do we use a a what is it called ?
68688	0	a	Like a iMac , if you can look through it .
68689	0	a	Or just a normal remote control .
68690	0	a	Maybe just as an option , w like we discussed , like iPod .
68691	0	a	, maybe it is a good idea .
68692	1	a	Different colours , maybe use even different fonts .
68693	0	a	Yeah .
68694	0	a	Oh yeah .
68695	0	a	Like phones .
68696	0	a	Different colours .
68697	0	a	Okay ,
68698	0	a	so y you just make it th through You look through it ?
68699	0	a	Okay .
68700	0	a	A see through .
68701	0	a	, that is cool .
68702	0	a	Yeah .
68703	0	a	as an option maybe .
68704	0	a	And so the buttons we have , this is , yeah , this is normal .
68705	1	a	We put in the the simple buttons on the top , and probably the the the more complicated buttons down there .
68706	0	a	It is the standard
68707	0	a	Yeah ,
68708	0	a	Yeah ,
68709	0	a	we but we do not We do not really have any complicated buttons .
68710	0	a	But you have You had a lot of different buttons .
68711	0	a	Yeah ,
68712	0	a	maybe you have you have to
68713	1	a	when you use teletec teletext , you can press a green or a red button to go to the next one , or to go to the previous one .
68714	0	a	Yeah okay ,
68715	0	a	but
68716	0	a	Yeah , well
68717	0	a	w
68718	0	a	I think the buttons are very easy .
68719	0	a	With just standard buttons we just have so little
68720	0	a	No , I do not need do not need
68721	0	a	teletext options are only four buttons or something .
68722	0	a	O
68723	1	a	but maybe you can put the g the options of teletext on the second level of the remote control .
68724	0	a	Because you ne almost never use it .
68725	0	a	Yeah ,
68726	0	a	but younger people I think more often use the internet and elderly people often use teletext .
68727	0	a	Yeah , that is right .
68728	0	a	So
68729	0	a	I use teletext as well .
68730	0	a	No ,
68731	0	a	I use te teletext every day , I think .
68732	0	a	Okay .
68733	0	a	Yeah .
68734	0	a	For me too , it is .
68735	0	a	So
68736	0	a	we just keep it one level then ?
68737	0	a	Okay .
68738	0	a	Yeah yeah , one level .
68739	0	a	And I think , cause we do not have that many buttons ,
68740	0	a	I think the design is most important .
68741	0	a	Yeah .
68742	1	a	You can d integrate the buttons in the design very much .
68743	0	a	Yeah .
68744	0	a	Cause simple buttons .
68745	1	a	If you put one above it , it is clear .
68746	0	a	Okay .
68747	0	a	Okay .
68748	0	a	So
68749	0	a	that is it for toda for We are going to have a lunch lunch break .
68750	0	a	So yeah ,
68751	0	a	you know what you have to do .
68752	0	a	How long is lunch break ?
68753	0	a	Okay .
68754	0	a	This is this is it .

68770	0	a	I was a bit early .
68771	0	a	Like
68772	0	a	What ?
68773	0	a	No ,
68774	0	a	I just came in .
68775	0	a	Why ?
68776	0	a	Okay .
68777	0	a	normally I was one of them .
68778	0	a	Come on .
68779	0	a	Check check check check .
68780	0	a	Hello .
68781	0	a	Why wo not it wake up ?
68782	0	a	Is it on ?
68783	0	a	But how ?
68784	0	a	there it is .
68785	0	a	Oop .
68786	0	a	The power light does not work .
68787	0	a	You turned it off .
68788	0	a	Okay .
68789	0	a	Okay .
68790	0	a	I received an email with a few possibilities on the materials .
68791	1	a	So I will discuss them with you .
68792	0	a	Okay ,
68793	1	a	we are just going to the later .
68794	0	a	Okay .
68795	0	a	Yeah .
68796	0	a	Yeah ,
68797	0	a	I received an email as well .
68798	0	a	So
68799	0	a	we are going to talk about the conceptual model .
68800	0	a	Oh .
68801	0	a	Which one was mine ?
68802	0	a	The minutes .
68803	0	a	So
68804	0	a	that is me .
68805	0	a	okay .
68806	0	a	So okay .
68807	0	a	Okay , so
68808	1	a	I just show you the m the no the the the the the the minutes , minute .
68809	0	a	What is it called ,
68810	0	a	I dunno .
68811	0	a	Whatever .
68812	0	a	Okay , so
68813	0	a	we just talked about
68814	0	a	Oh you want me to show that there
68815	0	a	or
68816	0	a	Okay ,
68817	0	a	we just talked about it looks .
68818	0	a	Shall I start ?
68819	0	a	No .
68820	0	a	No ,
68821	1	a	just tell us .
68822	0	a	no .
68823	0	a	Has to look nice .
68824	0	a	Usability is very important .
68825	0	a	People do not want to spend money on something that is similar to cheaper ones .
68826	0	a	It has to be very basic , not too many buttons .
68827	0	a	Light switches on if you use a button .
68828	0	a	text TV still has to be a possibility .
68829	0	a	And it has to be easy to learn .
68830	0	a	That were the things I make minutes of .
68831	0	a	And the functions are volume , channel to choose channels , an on off , a mute button , and a text TV button .
68832	0	a	That are the functions .
68833	0	a	That right ?
68834	0	a	Okay .
68835	0	a	Yeah .
68836	0	a	Yes .
68837	0	a	So
68838	1	a	I just want to give you Mike again , the first presentation
68839	0	a	of your
68840	0	a	Yeah .
68841	0	a	Okay well
68842	0	a	I received an email
68843	0	a	Okay .
68844	0	a	I searched the web , and I searched on this d document , recent investigation of the remote control market .
68845	0	a	It has been done in Italy Italy and in another country in Europe , I forget it .
68846	0	a	but they found out the most important aspect for remote controls happens to be a fancy look and feel , instead of the current functional look and feel .
68847	1	a	So it is very important for us to create something new .
68848	0	a	So
68849	0	a	what Michael just said ,
68850	1	a	it must be some very different from ordinary remote controls .
68851	0	a	Fancy stands for an original look and feel of the case and interface .
68852	0	a	this aspect is the most important one .
68853	0	a	it came out of the research .
68854	0	a	It is twice important as the following .
68855	0	a	The second most important aspect is that a remote control should it technological innovative .
68856	0	a	that stands for new technical features .
68857	1	a	And then that This is a point of discussion ,
68858	0	a	because we just decided that we do not make use of LCD or speech recognition .
68859	0	a	But this is the second important aspect ,
68860	1	a	and I think we must use some of the new technology , to be innovative .
68861	0	a	But we already have the flashing flashing light
68862	0	a	on the
68863	0	a	Okay .
68864	1	a	maybe maybe something new .
68865	0	a	Yeah , more .
68866	1	a	We have to discuss about it
68867	0	a	s
68868	0	a	Okay ,
68869	0	a	features not do not exist in current remote controls .
68870	0	a	Well ,
68871	1	a	I will I will get back on it .
68872	0	a	And that is very hard I think .
68873	0	a	the third one is the aspect of the remote control should be easy to use .
68874	0	a	But that was an overall point .
68875	0	a	We already discussed that .
68876	0	a	I have got one picture .
68877	0	a	d our our target group we thought about was young and trendy .
68878	0	a	Yeah .
68879	0	a	So I took that part of the webpage .
68880	0	a	And it says fashion watchers of Pari France and Italy , yeah , have detected the following trends .
68881	0	a	This trends I th trend
68882	0	a	I think it is not that meaningful for us , maybe .
68883	0	a	But it is about clothes and shoes .
68884	0	a	But the the next aspect also in contrast to last year , the feel of material is expe is expected to be spongy .
68885	0	a	Spongy .
68886	0	a	But spongy , what what does spongy says ?
68887	0	a	Spongy .
68888	0	a	Spongy .
68889	0	a	Spongy , like sponge .
68890	0	a	Okay .
68891	0	a	So rubber , kind of .
68892	0	a	soft materials .
68893	0	a	Yeah .
68894	0	a	But maybe th that is al definitely a good idea ,
68895	0	a	because you have you are you drop y your remote control very often on the ground .
68896	0	a	Yeah ,
68897	0	a	but Yeah .
68898	1	a	So it has to be flexible .
68899	0	a	Yeah .
68900	0	a	Yeah ,
68901	0	a	it is something that it stand there .
68902	0	a	But I did not knew knew what it means .
68903	0	a	So spongy means
68904	0	a	y
68905	0	a	Yeah .
68906	0	a	It is like a sponge .
68907	0	a	Soft , sponge .
68908	0	a	So
68909	0	a	it is also a stress ball .
68910	0	a	That is a good That is a good idea .
68911	0	a	Yeah ,
68912	0	a	somewhat like
68913	0	a	Yeah ,
68914	0	a	I have some material information ,
68915	1	a	but I will give you it later in my presentation .
68916	0	a	If it is de like that .
68917	0	a	That is good , a good idea .
68918	0	a	Yeah ,
68919	0	a	but
68920	0	a	Yeah .
68921	1	a	How are you going to make it ?
68922	0	a	Yeah .
68923	0	a	Is it a bit like like the the the the remote control ?
68924	1	a	R soft .
68925	0	a	Okay ?
68926	1	a	What do I think ?
68927	0	a	because a fancy look is the most important thing for remote control control ,
68928	1	a	I think about changeable fronts .
68929	0	a	Okay .
68930	0	a	Yeah .
68931	1	a	maybe a see through one in a a fruit front .
68932	0	a	Because it is it is hot .
68933	1	a	And some basic colour fronts .
68934	1	a	so we can make five different fronts to start with or something .
68935	1	a	maybe an extraordinary shape , like a sponge .
68936	0	a	or , yeah ,
68937	1	a	just another shape than a normal remote control ha has .
68938	1	a	Just something round in it , or maybe not not
68939	0	a	Yeah ,
68940	0	a	I dun dunno .
68941	1	a	We have to discuss about that .
68942	0	a	y
68943	0	a	yeah .
68944	0	a	Main point still is the technolo technological innovative .
68945	0	a	Yeah ,
68946	1	a	how do we do that ?
68947	0	a	Maybe speech ?
68948	1	a	We ma must have some kind of gadget .
68949	0	a	Yeah ,
68950	1	a	I will get back on that .
68951	0	a	So
68952	0	a	Intro
68953	0	a	Yeah .
68954	0	a	It is very difficult to to to do it .
68955	0	a	Because it is only twelve and a half Euros you have to spend on every remote control .
68956	0	a	Yeah , that is the problem .
68957	0	a	Well ,
68958	0	a	I got f also an email from the the technology department .
68959	0	a	That is the main problem .
68960	0	a	So
68961	1	a	Maybe we watch the first the next two presentations .
68962	0	a	They have done research about it , and even more possibilities now with speech .
68963	0	a	So they recommended using it .
68964	0	a	Okay .
68965	0	a	Well
68966	1	a	I will check what they exact mean .
68967	0	a	Okay .
68968	1	a	let is first watch Paul is presentation first then .
68969	0	a	So
68970	0	a	Yeah , th that is the only problem .
68971	0	a	Yeah , well
68972	0	a	actually we have do not have an idea how much it is going to cost .
68973	0	a	But maybe it is cheap and it is easy to implement .
68974	0	a	I d
68975	0	a	They do not say how much it will cost ,
68976	0	a	so but
68977	1	a	if we implement speech recognition , I think it would be better to implement LCD as well .
68978	0	a	Oh .
68979	0	a	It is mass production .
68980	0	a	So you can say , you can
68981	0	a	Yeah .
68982	0	a	Since you have to configure speech thing .
68983	0	a	But that is definitely more expensive
68984	0	a	than
68985	0	a	Yeah ,
68986	0	a	but a telephone
68987	0	a	Okay , yeah .
68988	0	a	Yeah ,
68989	0	a	that is that is something I dunno .
68990	0	a	But how
68991	0	a	we we are going to make many of those .
68992	0	a	So we can start a mass production , and then the cost will still will be .
68993	0	a	But a telephone also have a LCD and and it is about t two hundred Euros .
68994	0	a	Yeah ,
68995	0	a	so
68996	0	a	we gotta de
68997	1	a	We have to decide on that .
68998	0	a	So
68999	0	a	Yeah ,
69000	1	a	just modern modern but still basic .
69001	0	a	Yeah .
69002	0	a	Okay .
69003	0	a	That was this ?
69004	0	a	No , I do not I do not like it .
69005	0	a	LDC does not require Okay .
69006	0	a	Oh
69007	0	a	I got an email
69008	0	a	And it says the chip can be simple , regular or advanced .
69009	0	a	And
69010	0	a	They say a display requires an advanced chip .
69011	0	a	And this is more expensive than all the other chips .
69012	0	a	So
69013	0	a	it is m the most expensive .
69014	0	a	Yeah ,
69015	0	a	it says in the email .
69016	0	a	The display requires an advanced chip .
69017	0	a	And speech recognition ?
69018	0	a	Advanced .
69019	0	a	Yeah , probably too .
69020	0	a	I I have not got anything about speech recognition ,
69021	0	a	but
69022	0	a	Well
69023	0	a	it d
69024	0	a	That is that is the most expensive chip , we need .
69025	0	a	Yeah .
69026	1	a	I will I will give you my design .
69027	0	a	If we are doing if we are doing a display .
69028	0	a	Yeah okay .
69029	0	a	So
69030	0	a	we
69031	0	a	Well
69032	0	a	we can
69033	0	a	I had to make a sort of a design .
69034	0	a	So I did some searching on the internet .
69035	0	a	I watched the old remote controls and news com remote como remote controls .
69036	0	a	I think we should
69037	0	a	This is one of the modern remote controls of the moment .
69038	1	a	I think we should go more to the iPod and MP three players .
69039	1	a	Mobile phones .
69040	0	a	More modern .
69041	0	a	Y yes .
69042	1	a	you probably have to make it a bit bigger and a bit smaller .
69043	0	a	Cause remote con control , you can see it here , you have to bo reach both out both sides .
69044	0	a	And here you just have one , few buttons .
69045	0	a	So that is that is the main difference .
69046	0	a	But looks
69047	0	a	I definitely think we should go like this .
69048	1	a	And then changeable fonts ,
69049	0	a	so
69050	0	a	It is the most important part , I think .
69051	0	a	But
69052	1	a	And the home base is something like that , something simple .
69053	0	a	Well
69054	0	a	and then I just ordered the the buttons a bit .
69055	1	a	basic buttons .
69056	1	a	On off , mute .
69057	1	a	And th maybe two others , I dunno .
69058	0	a	Yeah ,
69059	1	a	maybe the teletext tel
69060	0	a	No .
69061	1	a	Text buttons .
69062	0	a	Yeah , text button ,
69063	1	a	maybe there and there .
69064	1	a	And then the colour buttons , if we want it on .
69065	0	a	I do not find it very usable ,
69066	0	a	but it is
69067	0	a	I do not think it is fits in the the modern theme as well .
69068	0	a	So
69069	0	a	and then yeah
69070	0	a	we saw the the pla display , in the the iPod .
69071	1	a	They can put the basic buttons , one , two , three , four .
69072	1	a	And f above ten .
69073	0	a	And I think
69074	0	a	No no .
69075	0	a	But it
69076	0	a	That is on on the display .
69077	0	a	That th there is no display there .
69078	0	a	But it is on the place of the display .
69079	1	a	And I think we should light this up much more than that part .
69080	0	a	So the focus is on these two parts .
69081	0	a	Yeah .
69082	0	a	Yeah .
69083	0	a	So you do not see all the buttons you else need .
69084	0	a	But it sounds very difficult to use .
69085	0	a	Because the volume and channel is on the on the the bottom of it .
69086	0	a	well
69087	0	a	This is how it is now .
69088	0	a	So you ca not use your thumb for it .
69089	0	a	Here Well we have volume .
69090	0	a	I think it is on on the bottom too .
69091	0	a	Yeah ,
69092	0	a	down there .
69093	0	a	But it is not not the best best .
69094	0	a	Yeah .
69095	0	a	Well
69096	1	a	here we have also side scrolls .
69097	0	a	I dunno if we can use that .
69098	0	a	Yeah , okay .
69099	0	a	Yeah ,
69100	1	a	for volume .
69101	0	a	Do we want to use
69102	0	a	For volume ?
69103	0	a	Well
69104	1	a	then we can even simplify it more .
69105	0	a	Yeah ,
69106	0	a	I have I have got something of that too .
69107	1	a	For volume , or a channel .
69108	0	a	Yeah , why not .
69109	0	a	Scroll .
69110	1	a	By just putting the volume on the side .
69111	1	a	And and just channel buttons here .
69112	0	a	And the channels as well .
69113	0	a	Oh
69114	0	a	yeah .
69115	0	a	Yeah ,
69116	0	a	or maybe
69117	0	a	The channel buttons are often used .
69118	0	a	But I think
69119	0	a	Well .
69120	0	a	And you ca not use them now with your thumb ,
69121	0	a	because the thing is not , it is not easy to control .
69122	0	a	Yeah , well
69123	0	a	it is Basically it is it is here .
69124	0	a	Yeah okay ,
69125	1	a	m maybe we cho should put that on top , and buttons we we do not use on , in the bottom .
69126	0	a	Yeah , that is better .
69127	0	a	They are on top ?
69128	0	a	You mean these to the low ?
69129	0	a	Oh okay .
69130	0	a	Yeah , just th th th other buttons like text TV .
69131	0	a	Put that on the button bottom .
69132	0	a	Because you ca not hold it .
69133	0	a	You ca not hold it th the control and push the buttons .
69134	0	a	Yeah .
69135	1	a	Except from the on off button .
69136	0	a	Well ,
69137	0	a	yeah .
69138	0	a	But I I think w you will use the switch channels buttons more often than the normal channel buttons , like one two three .
69139	1	a	So maybe we can put that on the bottom .
69140	0	a	Maybe .
69141	0	a	I dunno ,
69142	0	a	but yeah
69143	0	a	we will
69144	0	a	Yeah ,
69145	0	a	maybe it is not easy if it is below .
69146	0	a	Like zapping is just switching one channel at a time .
69147	0	a	It is harder to zap .
69148	1	a	So I think it should be should be easy to .
69149	0	a	I think it is pretty standard , these rubber buttons on the top .
69150	0	a	Yeah okay .
69151	0	a	That is that is good ,
69152	0	a	but
69153	0	a	Yeah okay .
69154	0	a	And if you do not light them up , they do not you do not see them very good .
69155	0	a	I think it is modern to light this area up , and to light this area up .
69156	0	a	So the focus gets on these parts and not on there .
69157	0	a	But the position of course can be different .
69158	0	a	It is s
69159	1	a	We have to look what is easy to use , and how it is easier to use .
69160	0	a	Yeah .
69161	0	a	So we can switch these to
69162	0	a	I dunno if it l will look good , if you put those on t on the bottom half .
69163	0	a	No ,
69164	0	a	I think th the the top buttons are okay .
69165	0	a	Okay .
69166	0	a	They sh Those should be on top .
69167	0	a	Yeah ,
69168	0	a	maybe
69169	0	a	Those two , yeah .
69170	1	a	But we we can switch those two ,
69171	0	a	yeah .
69172	0	a	And , yeah ,
69173	0	a	you have to make sure it is easy to
69174	0	a	Yes ,
69175	1	a	it has to be big enough
69176	0	a	so you can hold it ,
69177	0	a	right .
69178	0	a	Okay .
69179	0	a	Well
69180	0	a	that is that is my findings .
69181	0	a	So
69182	1	a	my personal opinion is that we should go more modern look .
69183	1	a	MP three player .
69184	0	a	And well
69185	1	a	if we want to put in speech rec recognition or something , we I do not think we should put it on top then .
69186	1	a	I think that , if we are going to put in more technology , that you need to be able to switch it open .
69187	0	a	Yeah .
69188	0	a	To use
69189	0	a	So
69190	0	a	if you put in speech recognition , you need so more many more buttons .
69191	0	a	Yeah .
69192	0	a	Yeah , that is cool .
69193	0	a	Which wo not look good on the front side I think .
69194	0	a	Okay .
69195	0	a	No .
69196	0	a	So
69197	1	a	that is something we have to decide on .
69198	0	a	Yeah ,
69199	0	a	we have to keep it simple .
69200	0	a	Yeah .
69201	1	a	We have to decide this this lecture , or this this this fifty minutes , yeah , how it is going to look .
69202	0	a	What we are going to do .
69203	0	a	Okay .
69204	0	a	Okay ,
69205	0	a	the component design .
69206	0	a	I looked at some similar devices , and my own common knowledge .
69207	0	a	So
69208	0	a	this was on the web site .
69209	0	a	If you aim at a young public , you should use materials that are soft with primary colours like green , blue , red .
69210	0	a	So flashy kind of colours .
69211	0	a	shapes should be curved , so round shapes .
69212	0	a	Not Nothing square like .
69213	0	a	Okay , so
69214	0	a	, okay .
69215	0	a	Yeah well
69216	0	a	iPod is trendy .
69217	0	a	And it is well curved square .
69218	0	a	Yeah .
69219	0	a	Square .
69220	0	a	Like .
69221	0	a	Yeah , but is has round corners I think .
69222	0	a	Okay .
69223	0	a	So not
69224	0	a	Yeah okay .
69225	0	a	So
69226	0	a	we should not have too square corners and that kind of thing .
69227	0	a	Not the old box look .
69228	0	a	Yeah .
69229	0	a	And sports and gaming device style characteristics .
69230	0	a	I do not know exactly what that means ,
69231	1	a	but it should be , well yeah , popular kind of looking , I think .
69232	0	a	Yeah ,
69233	0	a	we have to put our Real Reaction logo as well on the on the remote control .
69234	0	a	Okay .
69235	0	a	Yeah ,
69236	0	a	it is
69237	0	a	Black yellow control .
69238	0	a	So
69239	0	a	the colours also .
69240	1	a	So we have ha to ma make it in black , black , yellow .
69241	0	a	Yeah .
69242	1	a	Maybe the sides in yellow and the the the top in black .
69243	0	a	Yeah ,
69244	0	a	n Not that weird ,
69245	0	a	because we definitely want to make it kind of flashy , to attract a young public .
69246	0	a	Yeah , but
69247	0	a	I do not think the the colours black and yellow go well together .
69248	0	a	But
69249	0	a	Yeah , okay .
69250	0	a	No , okay .
69251	0	a	We make i
69252	1	a	Maybe you can put yellow on the side and black on the on the front .
69253	0	a	That is a that is a sen
69254	0	a	That is just a matter of tastes ,
69255	0	a	but
69256	1	a	We have to use kind of flashy colours , I think .
69257	0	a	ca not we use different fron fronts , with all with the the logo on it ?
69258	0	a	Can we do that ?
69259	0	a	So
69260	0	a	Yes .
69261	0	a	Yeah .
69262	0	a	Yeah , it is cool .
69263	0	a	Yep .
69264	1	a	Like fronts in in red and yellow and blue
69265	0	a	and
69266	0	a	Okay .
69267	0	a	And still trans
69268	1	a	Still still transparent .
69269	0	a	Oh yeah .
69270	0	a	So
69271	0	a	Yeah .
69272	0	a	But with all with logo on it .
69273	0	a	Okay .
69274	0	a	Well
69275	0	a	this is a remote control , a very old one .
69276	0	a	Then the components .
69277	0	a	The case has just a Here is black .
69278	0	a	Yeah , I dunno .
69279	0	a	Yeah ,
69280	0	a	we make it som
69281	1	a	Maybe we have to make it from soft material .
69282	0	a	I am not sure .
69283	0	a	Yeah .
69284	0	a	Maybe .
69285	1	a	But anyways it should be transparent .
69286	0	a	We decided that ,
69287	0	a	huh ?
69288	0	a	S
69289	0	a	Okay .
69290	0	a	Well
69291	0	a	one of the options .
69292	0	a	You can
69293	1	a	Just like a mobile phone , you can make different fronts on it .
69294	1	a	So you can just replace them I think .
69295	0	a	Yeah , we could do that .
69296	0	a	That was the idea ,
69297	1	a	or just release one .
69298	0	a	Yeah .
69299	1	a	Just give five with them , just in a box .
69300	1	a	Five different
69301	0	a	Yeah .
69302	0	a	Yeah ,
69303	1	a	Or just sell different ones .
69304	0	a	Yeah ,
69305	1	a	but y you could you could make them like blue and transparent .
69306	0	a	So you can still th look through it .
69307	0	a	Yeah .
69308	0	a	Cool .
69309	0	a	Yeah .
69310	1	a	the buttons .
69311	1	a	Normal rubber I think .
69312	1	a	Like normal ordinary buttons .
69313	0	a	Yeah ,
69314	0	a	I I dunno .
69315	1	a	Soft .
69316	0	a	Yeah .
69317	0	a	A more
69318	0	a	Yeah ,
69319	0	a	just
69320	0	a	I think rubber really has an odd look .
69321	1	a	It it could be like a Nokia , like plastic .
69322	0	a	Yeah .
69323	1	a	With the hard hard buttons .
69324	0	a	That is better prob
69325	0	a	Yeah .
69326	0	a	Okay .
69327	0	a	Yeah .
69328	0	a	The the the new new modern remote controls , the buttons are part of the the style , I think is part of the remote control itself .
69329	0	a	Yeah .
69330	0	a	It it is one a one out of one shape .
69331	0	a	it is n does not Is a button
69332	0	a	How do you say it ?
69333	0	a	It it did not it i
69334	0	a	it do not come out of the on the background .
69335	0	a	Yeah ,
69336	0	a	it is it is all on one level .
69337	0	a	Yeah ,
69338	0	a	on one level .
69339	0	a	It is in the c a remote control
69340	0	a	Yeah .
69341	0	a	Yeah .
69342	0	a	Yeah ,
69343	0	a	I know what you mean .
69344	0	a	So
69345	0	a	we have to keep it on the one level .
69346	0	a	Like th the top it is
69347	0	a	Yeah .
69348	0	a	Yeah ,
69349	1	a	like mobile phones .
69350	1	a	Like the iPod .
69351	0	a	just
69352	0	a	I dunno what kind of material it is .
69353	0	a	Yeah , okay .
69354	0	a	Okay ,
69355	0	a	it is chos
69356	1	a	So that should be hard plastic .
69357	0	a	Yeah , that is cool .
69358	1	a	Then the buttons ?
69359	0	a	I think .
69360	0	a	Or maybe
69361	0	a	Yeah .
69362	0	a	But
69363	0	a	Oops .
69364	1	a	But maybe you can m make a round fluff or soft material .
69365	1	a	Just only the basic basic remote control from normal plastic ,
69366	0	a	and
69367	1	a	the rounds of it from softer s
69368	0	a	I dunno .
69369	0	a	Yeah .
69370	0	a	Okay .
69371	0	a	Yeah .
69372	0	a	And Then the LED .
69373	1	a	The normal infrared LED
69374	1	a	I think s sufficient .
69375	1	a	And back light LEDs .
69376	0	a	Y
69377	0	a	Cool .
69378	0	a	So
69379	1	a	But I think we have to make the case transparent ,
69380	0	a	otherwise the back light wo not work .
69381	0	a	Yeah .
69382	0	a	So if you put
69383	0	a	Okay .
69384	0	a	Yeah .
69385	1	a	you can just make them around the buttons
69386	0	a	Yeah .
69387	0	a	Y i if you The numbers could be can be
69388	0	a	Yeah , that is right .
69389	1	a	Or it runs the whole
69390	0	a	Yeah ,
69391	1	a	you can halfs transparent , or just that it is comes out a bit .
69392	0	a	Yeah ,
69393	1	a	but we can still make it transparent .
69394	0	a	So
69395	0	a	Or no
69396	0	a	Yeah okay .
69397	0	a	They can choose .
69398	0	a	Good .
69399	0	a	And in green colour , the back lights
69400	0	a	or
69401	0	a	Yeah ?
69402	0	a	No ,
69403	0	a	but I think there are multiple colour LEDs .
69404	0	a	Different , I think , also .
69405	1	a	Blue .
69406	1	a	Blue or red .
69407	0	a	Yeah .
69408	1	a	Whatever you want it , I think .
69409	0	a	depends on the colour of the
69410	0	a	Yeah , that is true .
69411	0	a	Yeah ,
69412	1	a	but you ca not choo You ca not choose it when you buy it .
69413	0	a	i
69414	0	a	Yeah ,
69415	0	a	but can you change it if you already bought the the remote control ?
69416	0	a	You
69417	0	a	You have to choose Is it
69418	0	a	Okay .
69419	0	a	But
69420	0	a	Yeah , it can .
69421	0	a	So I
69422	0	a	I know I dunno .
69423	0	a	Is
69424	0	a	Maybe it is it is more impor more expensive .
69425	0	a	Cause this a mo mib mobile phone as well .
69426	0	a	Yeah , okay .
69427	1	a	Maybe put some different ones in it .
69428	0	a	Does not matter .
69429	0	a	I think it is
69430	0	a	Yeah ,
69431	0	a	I dunno .
69432	0	a	It is just No , just some LED .
69433	0	a	I have the mo mi
69434	0	a	I have a blinking light on my phone .
69435	0	a	And I can change the colour of it .
69436	0	a	Okay , cool .
69437	1	a	Just make it some different colours .
69438	1	a	Blue , red and green , or something .
69439	0	a	Maybe it is too expensive , but
69440	0	a	it I th
69441	0	a	I do not think so .
69442	0	a	Well ,
69443	0	a	we do not put put in any fancier technology yet .
69444	0	a	So I am sure we can fit in .
69445	0	a	Then some more technical things .
69446	0	a	I do not know what it is ,
69447	1	a	but it should be there I think .
69448	0	a	this is the normal circuit board , like a chip board in in a lot of things .
69449	0	a	Yeah ,
69450	1	a	we have to hurry up a bit ,
69451	0	a	so
69452	0	a	Okay .
69453	0	a	W
69454	0	a	So we d we just need this and this transistors and resonators .
69455	0	a	There is all these kind of things .
69456	0	a	they they basically said that that is almost the same on any remote controls .
69457	0	a	So I guess we j we just need that .
69458	0	a	Yeah .
69459	0	a	I do not know what they do
69460	0	a	or
69461	0	a	Nah ,
69462	0	a	but they just said we need it .
69463	0	a	Okay yeah ,
69464	1	a	you can you can change
69465	0	a	Yeah .
69466	0	a	Yeah okay .
69467	0	a	We just
69468	0	a	Yeah ,
69469	0	a	we have to make sure to
69470	0	a	Yes .
69471	0	a	No .
69472	0	a	the battery contacts , like normal batteries ca you can put in .
69473	0	a	Yeah ,
69474	1	a	a recharger maybe .
69475	0	a	Yeah okay .
69476	0	a	Yeah
69477	0	a	but
69478	0	a	Yeah ,
69479	1	a	but it i We do not want to have a ar an
69480	0	a	How do you call it ?
69481	0	a	Accu .
69482	0	a	We still want to have a recharger , do not we ?
69483	0	a	Is that still the A recha
69484	0	a	Oh no .
69485	0	a	Yes .
69486	0	a	Re recharger .
69487	0	a	Y
69488	1	a	just just batteries , rechargeable batteries .
69489	0	a	Battery .
69490	0	a	Base station .
69491	0	a	It is just a battery .
69492	0	a	Yeah .
69493	0	a	Yeah , batteries .
69494	0	a	Yes , rechargeable batteries , I think is best .
69495	0	a	Okay .
69496	0	a	Not a separate
69497	0	a	Okay .
69498	0	a	No , just rechargeable batteries .
69499	0	a	And a chip , that is this one .
69500	0	a	Then I received some possibilities .
69501	0	a	for the energy source we can use batteries or a kinetic
69502	0	a	Like with the pulse watch .
69503	0	a	So
69504	0	a	it operates on your wrist kind of .
69505	0	a	cool .
69506	0	a	Okay .
69507	0	a	So
69508	0	a	if you hold it , it gets powered .
69509	0	a	If you hold it .
69510	0	a	But normally you put a remote control on the table or on the couch .
69511	0	a	Yeah , I do not think it will work ,
69512	0	a	and
69513	0	a	Or we can also use solar cells .
69514	0	a	But you mostly use it indoors ,
69515	0	a	so
69516	0	a	Yeah ,
69517	0	a	and and we can use the home station kind of thing .
69518	0	a	It is dark in the room .
69519	0	a	No .
69520	1	a	It is just batteries ,
69521	0	a	that is cheaper .
69522	0	a	Yeah .
69523	0	a	cases , flat , so uncurved .
69524	0	a	two D curved is like front to the back .
69525	0	a	And three D curved is also in depth .
69526	0	a	Okay .
69527	0	a	So
69528	0	a	that is possible .
69529	0	a	but with three D curved remote controls , we must use rubber buttons .
69530	0	a	So we ca not use the flat buttons .
69531	0	a	So
69532	0	a	we need two D .
69533	0	a	Yeah , I think .
69534	0	a	Yeah .
69535	0	a	Definitely .
69536	0	a	these kind of materials can be used .
69537	0	a	But it does not really matter ,
69538	1	a	we just make it plastic .
69539	0	a	Yeah .
69540	0	a	Yeah , I think so too .
69541	0	a	The scroll wheels , that is cool .
69542	0	a	That is for the volume .
69543	0	a	Yeah ,
69544	0	a	scroll wheels
69545	0	a	Yeah , that is good .
69546	0	a	Yeah .
69547	1	a	We can use multiple scroll wheels , w if we want to .
69548	0	a	But I think just the volume is enough .
69549	0	a	Yeah .
69550	0	a	For channels it is not handy ,
69551	0	a	because you scroll too fast .
69552	0	a	Okay .
69553	0	a	And the LCD .
69554	0	a	So
69555	0	a	we need the expensive , most expensive chip , if we use an LCD .
69556	1	a	but we have to do something about the trend .
69557	0	a	I do not think that is an opportunity .
69558	1	a	Just skip it .
69559	0	a	Because we do not have time for that to to put it in .
69560	0	a	Okay ,
69561	0	a	then we we use m must use the second most expensive chip .
69562	0	a	So th so the regular chip .
69563	0	a	Because we use scroll wheels .
69564	0	a	Yeah , okay .
69565	0	a	Okay .
69566	0	a	And Yeah ,
69567	0	a	that was it I guess .
69568	0	a	Okay .
69569	0	a	are are we using a a rubber case ,
69570	0	a	or
69571	0	a	We have not decided yet .
69572	0	a	Oh
69573	0	a	just sk
69574	0	a	Maybe you have to skip that one as well .
69575	0	a	It is
69576	0	a	No .
69577	0	a	I do not think a rubber case looks
69578	0	a	Yeah , okay .
69579	0	a	L
69580	0	a	Yeah ,
69581	0	a	i it
69582	0	a	it should be soft .
69583	0	a	You said so ?
69584	0	a	So
69585	0	a	just hard plastic ?
69586	0	a	Okay .
69587	0	a	The trend is spong spongy and fruit or fresh fresh .
69588	0	a	That fruit and veg , or
69589	0	a	Yeah ,
69590	1	a	fruit and veg can be just the covers .
69591	0	a	And now we have nothing about about those those two .
69592	0	a	yeah
69593	0	a	i
69594	0	a	Just Just on front .
69595	0	a	So you can the the spongy
69596	0	a	yeah ,
69597	0	a	I dunno .
69598	0	a	I ca not imagine a soft remote control .
69599	0	a	Neith I do not like it neither .
69600	0	a	No .
69601	0	a	I just ca not imagine it .
69602	0	a	Yeah .
69603	0	a	Yeah , I think .
69604	0	a	Titanium .
69605	0	a	It is mentioned here .
69606	0	a	Titanium , I think it is too expensive .
69607	1	a	But maybe the form has to be a bit different .
69608	1	a	Not the sh the square form .
69609	1	a	Just a bit more rounded .
69610	0	a	Yeah ,
69611	1	a	you can make it curved or round .
69612	1	a	But just in two D , not in depth .
69613	0	a	Yeah .
69614	0	a	Yeah , that is right .
69615	0	a	Okay .
69616	0	a	So
69617	1	a	We have to decide which one we are going to choose from these .
69618	1	a	What exactly .
69619	0	a	Because we have to know it .
69620	0	a	So the energy is the recharger .
69621	0	a	We already know that .
69622	0	a	Yeah .
69623	0	a	Just a normal battery .
69624	0	a	We have batteries .
69625	0	a	Okay .
69626	0	a	The chip on print is a normal one .
69627	0	a	Yeah .
69628	0	a	Regular .
69629	0	a	Okay ,
69630	0	a	the case is just a plastic one .
69631	0	a	Yeah th
69632	0	a	yeah , the chip is the the regular one .
69633	0	a	Yeah , re Yeah , regular .
69634	0	a	You have the simple one , regular and advanced .
69635	0	a	Yeah , okay .
69636	0	a	So it is b should be regular the second .
69637	0	a	Yeah , regular .
69638	0	a	Okay .
69639	1	a	I think I will just check it .
69640	0	a	And we need a plastic case , with a scroll wheel .
69641	0	a	Yes .
69642	0	a	That is pretty much it .
69643	0	a	Yeah .
69644	0	a	User interface concept .
69645	0	a	And a flashy light .
69646	0	a	So
69647	0	a	I am not sure .
69648	0	a	But we do I do not know if we expected to draw on this one at this moment .
69649	0	a	But
69650	0	a	Yeah .
69651	0	a	I dunno either .
69652	0	a	Or should we do it in the next meeting ?
69653	0	a	So we should did it here ?
69654	0	a	Or should we do it in the next meeting ?
69655	0	a	Okay .
69656	0	a	ID and UID work together on prototype drawing on smart board .
69657	0	a	That is for the next one .
69658	0	a	So we are staying here ?
69659	0	a	Okay ,
69660	0	a	so
69661	0	a	now we are ka thirty minutes alone again ?
69662	0	a	Yeah ,
69663	0	a	I dunno .
69664	0	a	That is for th
69665	0	a	that I think that is the next next meeting .
69666	0	a	But you definitely get a specific instruction .
69667	0	a	Yeah .
69668	1	a	But th think about something that is more rounded .
69669	0	a	Just And more It has to be
69670	1	a	a bit .
69671	0	a	But the iPod and etcetera , MP three players , mobile phones .
69672	1	a	Just just on the top or on the bottom .
69673	0	a	Just a bit
69674	0	a	cur
69675	0	a	Okay ,
69676	1	a	I will see if I can see any of those .
69677	1	a	Maybe the wheel can be like like this .
69678	0	a	O if you draw it like this , you get a
69679	0	a	What the fuck is it ?
69680	0	a	Okay .
69681	0	a	Does not work .
69682	0	a	You see what I mean ?
69683	0	a	If I draw here It draws about four centimetres lower
69684	0	a	than
69685	0	a	Nah okay .
69686	0	a	What ?
69687	0	a	Oh .
69688	0	a	Okay .
69689	0	a	Just .
69690	1	a	Maybe you can make it like this .
69691	1	a	And this is all the wheel for volume .
69692	0	a	So that you just
69693	1	a	It is all rounded ,
69694	0	a	so you can do turn this one .
69695	0	a	Like a very big scroll wheel .
69696	0	a	Yeah ,
69697	1	a	but just not on the top , but on the side of it .
69698	0	a	Okay .
69699	0	a	Maybe , I dunno .
69700	0	a	Okay , so
69701	0	a	we have this at the moment .
69702	0	a	I think you will get a a lot of volume changing when it is not wanted .
69703	0	a	Yeah ,
69704	0	a	you
69705	0	a	Yeah .
69706	0	a	Okay , so
69707	0	a	we would have this .
69708	0	a	Is that okay ?
69709	0	a	And
69710	0	a	Like this .
69711	0	a	Yeah .
69712	0	a	Yeah ,
69713	0	a	that is a little problem , of course , as well .
69714	0	a	I think it is probably better .
69715	0	a	Yeah ,
69716	1	a	but maybe we can make a a plastic , so that you i if you like drop it , it wo not change the volume .
69717	0	a	Yeah ,
69718	1	a	maybe you just have to make it
69719	1	a	That is not scrollable too easy .
69720	1	a	Only if you use your finger .
69721	1	a	And what is the channel choose ?
69722	1	a	Where do we put that ?
69723	0	a	Still on the bottom
69724	0	a	or
69725	0	a	That is the numbers .
69726	1	a	I think in middle .
69727	0	a	wh what is the middle part ?
69728	0	a	Numbers , okay .
69729	1	a	I think th the numbers should be in the bottom , and and the switch channel in the middle .
69730	0	a	Yeah , I agree as well .
69731	0	a	Use the dz
69732	0	a	Yeah , that is right .
69733	1	a	It does not make a difference , if you put the s the switch channels on side of each other or on top of each other .
69734	0	a	Because you already have the volume here ,
69735	0	a	so
69736	1	a	You can also put it here one butt and the other one there .
69737	1	a	Next to each other .
69738	1	a	back and forth .
69739	1	a	So you can also can put it all on the top , and this , you keep this empty .
69740	0	a	Because you have to hold it as well .
69741	1	a	Or you could do the switch channel up button above the the numbers and switch channel down button below .
69742	0	a	But that is not
69743	0	a	want to zap very quick ,
69744	0	a	so
69745	0	a	Yeah ?
69746	0	a	Is this a opportunity ,
69747	1	a	or you do not want
69748	1	a	a different
69749	0	a	Why ?
69750	0	a	But still the next It is still the next one .
69751	0	a	Yeah ,
69752	0	a	I think zapping is the highest priority .
69753	0	a	Yeah , okay .
69754	0	a	And then you use those
69755	0	a	Yeah , of course .
69756	1	a	but I think we we should bu put them on top of each other ,
69757	0	a	so
69758	0	a	Because then it is it is easy to know m if I push the the the up
69759	0	a	Yeah ,
69760	0	a	but the top the top button is is like you switch channel up ,
69761	0	a	and down button is If you put them
69762	0	a	But but I I think left to right is more often associated with volume , and top down is more with channel changing .
69763	0	a	Does not make
69764	0	a	Yeah ,
69765	0	a	but fo from left to right is exactly the same .
69766	0	a	Yeah .
69767	0	a	It ma it does not make a big difference .
69768	0	a	I I think it is
69769	0	a	It is it is obvious , I think .
69770	0	a	Yeah ,
69771	0	a	that is not not It is not al always the same .
69772	0	a	But it is exactly th
69773	0	a	I dunno .
69774	0	a	In On most on most remote controls .
69775	0	a	Every remote control is different .
69776	0	a	Yeah ,
69777	0	a	I think
69778	0	a	No ,
69779	0	a	I think
69780	0	a	Yeah .
69781	0	a	So so if we use that , they will probably have a long learning time .
69782	0	a	I
69783	0	a	You already have the volume on the side , so you ca not make it you ca not ma make a mistake .
69784	0	a	So it is
69785	0	a	So
69786	0	a	but that is for that is for you ,
69787	0	a	cause it is
69788	0	a	Okay , so .
69789	0	a	I think it is s so simple
69790	0	a	you just
69791	1	a	Yeah , okay I will d I will take a look at it .
69792	0	a	I dunno .
69793	0	a	Okay .
69794	1	a	What did What else we have to discuss about ?
69795	0	a	I dunno .
69796	0	a	Think we need to work thirty minutes again ?
69797	0	a	No ,
69798	0	a	you have It is
69799	0	a	the current controllers are all black and plastic .
69800	0	a	Yeah ,
69801	1	a	we have to care that it r looks really new .
69802	0	a	Because we still hold on to the ordinary square remote control .
69803	0	a	Yeah .
69804	0	a	Cause wha what I see the only difference
69805	0	a	i
69806	0	a	i i in fact is that we use a scroll wheel on the outside .
69807	0	a	And the LED .
69808	0	a	Yeah ,
69809	0	a	but i i it should be round in in shape .
69810	0	a	So
69811	0	a	No ,
69812	0	a	tha that will be
69813	0	a	Yeah ,
69814	1	a	so top down .
69815	1	a	You have to look at that image of the iPod .
69816	0	a	Yes .
69817	1	a	More that kind of style .
69818	0	a	Okay .
69819	0	a	And a bit
69820	1	a	Some some kind of bling bling can we have
69821	1	a	and how many fronts fronts do we put on the market then ?
69822	0	a	five or something ?
69823	0	a	Or more
69824	0	a	or And
69825	1	a	buy the product .
69826	1	a	Not not the old grey black
69827	0	a	Where you can put a ve we have
69828	1	a	If we do it like that we have below have we a lot of room to put a nice logo .
69829	0	a	Yeah .
69830	0	a	Yeah .
69831	0	a	the logo was has to be on there .
69832	0	a	Yeah , that is right .
69833	0	a	Yeah , five .
69834	0	a	Let is give five .
69835	1	a	Maybe you can buy separate ones
69836	0	a	and
69837	0	a	Yeah .
69838	1	a	You buy , you get one .
69839	1	a	And basic .
69840	1	a	Or you can choose one if you buy the project .
69841	0	a	I think
69842	0	a	Yeah .
69843	0	a	That is your choice , I think huh .
69844	0	a	So
69845	1	a	y you can put the bottom of the remote control in recharger ?
69846	0	a	Is that is that a good good opportunity ?
69847	0	a	So
69848	1	a	you could put it like that ,
69849	0	a	okay .
69850	0	a	Yes .
69851	0	a	Do we have to design that w as well ?
69852	0	a	The docking station ?
69853	0	a	Yeah ,
69854	1	a	you sl you let it slide in the docking station .
69855	0	a	Yeah .
69856	0	a	I am not sure .
69857	0	a	Yeah , I think so .
69858	0	a	Yeah ,
69859	0	a	we can b
69860	1	a	It c it could be just just a square , just a packet .
69861	1	a	But th Yeah , that can be very simple .
69862	1	a	Least .
69863	0	a	Yeah ,
69864	0	a	just a recharger .
69865	0	a	Yeah ,
69866	0	a	just where you are around something .
69867	0	a	Li
69868	0	a	Yeah ,
69869	0	a	we had one example .
69870	1	a	But we have to make contacts on the on the remote control and the recharger as well .
69871	0	a	Yeah ,
69872	0	a	but that is a round one .
69873	0	a	Which w
69874	0	a	Here you see one that is very round .
69875	1	a	Maybe we can choose then .
69876	0	a	Oh yeah , okay .
69877	0	a	So
69878	1	a	I think that can be all kind of shapes .
69879	1	a	But maybe you can just round up the corners a bit .
69880	0	a	Of the remote control ?
69881	0	a	Yeah
69882	0	a	Yeah .
69883	0	a	That is all .
69884	0	a	Yeah .
69885	0	a	Yeah .
69886	1	a	Just round it up .
69887	0	a	Yeah , so
69888	0	a	y you do not want this like the iPod .
69889	0	a	But More rounded .
69890	0	a	No .
69891	0	a	Yeah .
69892	0	a	Yeah .
69893	0	a	Yeah ,
69894	0	a	I think it will just look like more like this one .
69895	0	a	Since it is
69896	0	a	This is also rounded .
69897	0	a	No ,
69898	1	a	just just the corners .
69899	0	a	I think i
69900	0	a	Yeah okay ,
69901	0	a	tho those are al already a bit cornered .
69902	0	a	Yeah okay ,
69903	1	a	but then we have to think of something totally new .
69904	0	a	Okay .
69905	0	a	Yeah ,
69906	0	a	but we can we can do all kinds of
69907	1	a	As long as it isn is in two D we can use all kind of round shapes .
69908	0	a	Shapes .
69909	1	a	Not in depth .
69910	0	a	Yeah ,
69911	0	a	but Yeah , if if we want to make it kind of , yeah , new .
69912	0	a	I have I had a lot of picture of old ones .
69913	0	a	And all curves have already been done .
69914	0	a	It is a bit annoying ,
69915	0	a	is not it ?
69916	0	a	So
69917	1	a	we have to make a decision ,
69918	1	a	what kind of form it is going to have t going to have .
69919	0	a	Yeah .
69920	0	a	What do we do wrong ?
69921	1	a	Just just more like this and not a square .
69922	0	a	Yeah okay ,
69923	0	a	yeah
69924	0	a	well Yeah .
69925	0	a	Okay .
69926	0	a	Yeah ,
69927	1	a	but we could do a lot of , lot more curving .
69928	1	a	I would do it Like in this kind of shape
69929	0	a	or
69930	0	a	I dunno .
69931	0	a	I know we can do a lot more ,
69932	0	a	but
69933	0	a	I think it will only look more like the old remote controls .
69934	0	a	Yeah , it
69935	0	a	it is very annoying .
69936	0	a	Okay .
69937	0	a	I dunno if it is handy .
69938	0	a	Yeah .
69939	0	a	This ?
69940	0	a	The olden the olden ones had looked like just a square thing .
69941	0	a	Yeah .
69942	0	a	Yeah okay .
69943	0	a	But I had a lot of pictures
69944	1	a	Oh I can show you here what the old ones look like .
69945	0	a	Curves , curves .
69946	0	a	Yeah .
69947	0	a	You have more there as well .
69948	0	a	Yeah , okay .
69949	0	a	It was not very small one .
69950	0	a	Yeah .
69951	0	a	very simple .
69952	0	a	That is for elderly .
69953	0	a	Yeah ,
69954	0	a	I do not know .
69955	1	a	I think if w My opinion .
69956	1	a	If we just take the iPod , and the same look .
69957	0	a	Yeah .
69958	1	a	So light or just whatever colour , but the same light colours .
69959	0	a	And just with together with the back lights b look will look very new .
69960	1	a	No rubber buttons or something .
69961	0	a	Just together with the back lights you will get a totally new look .
69962	0	a	More like the MP three player M P M P three player .
69963	0	a	Yeah .
69964	1	a	And you have the scroll button inside .
69965	0	a	Yes .
69966	0	a	Okay .
69967	0	a	Just a simple scrollb Does not have to be .
69968	0	a	Yeah .
69969	0	a	But why do we have to round it on the t bottom then ?
69970	0	a	Of
69971	1	a	Skip that one as well .
69972	0	a	Okay .
69973	0	a	Yeah , it is cool .
69974	0	a	Yeah ,
69975	0	a	though that is a trend .
69976	0	a	If we want to make it .
69977	0	a	But yeah ,
69978	0	a	I am not a Trendwatcher , you are .
69979	0	a	So
69980	0	a	Spongeball kind of .
69981	0	a	the t the trend is spongy and fruity .
69982	0	a	Rubber spongy .
69983	0	a	But yeah .
69984	0	a	Yeah .
69985	0	a	No .
69986	0	a	Spongy
69987	0	a	and
69988	0	a	It is not not a lot of trends
69989	0	a	I
69990	0	a	I found
69991	0	a	It
69992	0	a	The th th
69993	0	a	Yeah .
69994	0	a	Okay , so
69995	0	a	we have s still one minute left .
69996	0	a	So just
69997	0	a	I think it is okay if you just keep it a bit square .
69998	0	a	Okay .
69999	0	a	Yeah ,
70000	0	a	I d I do not know n something about ergonomic kind of fits in the hand stuff .
70001	0	a	No .
70002	0	a	But I I think it is still for older people .
70003	0	a	You j still have older people .
70004	0	a	It is only annoying if it if it is like that f formed like that ,
70005	0	a	like f
70006	0	a	Whatever .
70007	0	a	Just you have a normal
70008	0	a	But i it is it is it is already fancy .
70009	0	a	There is one
70010	0	a	There is just one overall important aspect is that we must make it fancy
70011	0	a	and it looks original ,
70012	1	a	and I hope we can make it look not like the iPod itself .
70013	0	a	Yeah ,
70014	0	a	but we are we are aiming at a young public .
70015	1	a	It must have a very different
70016	0	a	Yeah , they are all the same .
70017	0	a	Yeah , idea .
70018	0	a	But you are
70019	0	a	If you look at the way remote controls are now
70020	0	a	And if you make it look like the iPod
70021	0	a	Yeah okay .
70022	0	a	Because of the lights on the bottom of it .
70023	0	a	That is already fancy .
70024	0	a	So
70025	0	a	that is already a very big change
70026	0	a	compared to
70027	0	a	yeah .
70028	1	a	maybe maybe make the the the wha what is it called scroll wheel .
70029	1	a	Make it in in yellow or something .
70030	1	a	Just like the colours of Real Reaction .
70031	0	a	Well
70032	0	a	Could .
70033	0	a	Yeah , we could do that .
70034	0	a	yeah ,
70035	0	a	but if you the f front , the scroll wheel will still be yellow .
70036	0	a	Yeah .
70037	0	a	No ,
70038	0	a	I think Oh .
70039	0	a	It is right .
70040	0	a	Think the scroll wheel wo not be very big .
70041	0	a	Since if you put it somewhere , the chances that it will scroll are too big .
70042	0	a	Yeah .
70043	0	a	So it will just be a small small scroll wheel .
70044	0	a	So it wo not stick out much .
70045	0	a	Yeah .
70046	0	a	Maybe the ones we are going to draw there .
70047	1	a	Maybe we have to ask to the the to her if it has if it can work better than this .
70048	0	a	Because it does not work properly .
70049	0	a	No .
70050	1	a	So maybe you have to ask her .
70051	0	a	Yeah okay .
70052	0	a	Well ,
70053	1	a	maybe we can just open images there ,
70054	1	a	and I will paint and paint .
70055	0	a	Okay .
70056	0	a	I will be able to do a better job .
70057	0	a	Yeah .
70058	0	a	That is probably
70059	0	a	Okay , so
70060	1	a	just finish it .
70061	0	a	If you set the pen
70062	0	a	yeah , he will draw here .
70063	0	a	Does not work .
70064	1	a	So we make it a bit like m that one probably .
70065	0	a	Yeah , I will see it .
70066	0	a	Yeah .
70067	0	a	Is that okay ?
70068	0	a	Okay ,
70069	0	a	only the colour and the flashy light
70070	0	a	and the
70071	0	a	We just we just skip the the the voca or was it the the speech recognition .
70072	0	a	Bu
70073	0	a	Yeah , I agree more like iPod .
70074	0	a	Yeah .
70075	0	a	Yes .
70076	0	a	Just a
70077	0	a	Speech .
70078	0	a	Yeah ,
70079	0	a	do we s keep that ?
70080	0	a	Yeah , I think
70081	0	a	Well
70082	0	a	then it w
70083	0	a	Well
70084	0	a	that is very easy .
70085	0	a	Or keep that ?
70086	0	a	It is okay .
70087	0	a	But you would definitely need a advanced chip .
70088	0	a	S
70089	0	a	yeah ,
70090	0	a	I do not know .
70091	0	a	No .
70092	0	a	Yeah , I think so .
70093	1	a	And we we have to build in a microphone
70094	0	a	and
70095	0	a	Yeah ,
70096	0	a	and I do I do not know anything about that .
70097	0	a	We already have the beeping of the home station ,
70098	0	a	so
70099	0	a	strange that I received the information about that .
70100	0	a	I d I did not receive any information on speech recognition ,
70101	0	a	so
70102	0	a	Fine .
70103	0	a	Oh
70104	0	a	that is hard .
70105	0	a	But
70106	0	a	the ma the main points
70107	0	a	I
70108	0	a	I
70109	0	a	I just said .
70110	0	a	So
70111	1	a	Can we just put it speech recognition in it as well ,
70112	0	a	okay ?
70113	0	a	Yeah .
70114	0	a	We have to be original and technological innovative .
70115	0	a	Becau
70116	0	a	Yeah .
70117	0	a	But Ma
70118	0	a	But we do not have any f information about the cost .
70119	0	a	So
70120	0	a	shall we it open then ?
70121	0	a	So we can put all the
70122	0	a	Okay .
70123	0	a	The function of that in there .
70124	0	a	Yeah .
70125	0	a	And we need a
70126	0	a	Probably we need a advanced chip then .
70127	0	a	Yeah , we probably do .
70128	0	a	But it does not say anything about it ,
70129	0	a	does it ?
70130	1	a	It does not has to say anything .
70131	0	a	Yeah .
70132	0	a	No .
70133	0	a	Oh yeah ,
70134	0	a	I
70135	0	a	No .
70136	0	a	We started with information about the cost was now th
70137	0	a	And how much is the chip ?
70138	0	a	The the the
70139	0	a	And how how does it work ?
70140	0	a	Is it
70141	0	a	No .
70142	0	a	I just I just received the
70143	0	a	Yeah .
70144	0	a	Yeah , I have I have some some information about the cost .
70145	0	a	But just a about the chip .
70146	0	a	I do not know how much ,
70147	0	a	but Just in inexpensive or
70148	0	a	But i it is a separate chip .
70149	0	a	Yeah ,
70150	0	a	our division has developed a new speech recognition feature , the integrated programmable sample sensor simple speaker u unit .
70151	0	a	This is a very small electronic unit , will give a standard answer after it recognise a question .
70152	0	a	Does not say .
70153	0	a	Just You say record , followed by your question sample , and after a few seconds the answer sample .
70154	0	a	Because
70155	0	a	So
70156	0	a	it works like good morning remote control , and then the remote control says good morning .
70157	1	a	Just You have to just talk to
70158	0	a	Okay ,
70159	1	a	we have to stop it now .
70160	0	a	Does it say does it say something back ?
70161	0	a	Okay .
70162	0	a	Yeah
70163	0	a	th that is just It is a
70164	0	a	No .
70165	0	a	So just
70166	0	a	Okay ,
70167	0	a	that is a r
70168	0	a	That is that is
70169	0	a	a advanced
70170	0	a	Yeah ,
70171	1	a	we just decide not to put it in ,
70172	0	a	because it is too difficult .
70173	0	a	Yeah ,
70174	0	a	it
70175	0	a	Well
70176	0	a	that is integrated in the chip , so if you use the speech recognition , that is in it .
70177	0	a	I dunno , but if we use speech recognition , that will be in it as well .
70178	0	a	Yeah ,
70179	0	a	I do not know anything about this ,
70180	0	a	but Nah .
70181	0	a	Yeah .
70182	0	a	Well
70183	0	a	it it would be would be a good feature feature .
70184	1	a	Okay , we just put it in ,
70185	0	a	because it is a good feature .
70186	0	a	Okay .
70187	0	a	No no worries about the cost , etcetera .
70188	1	a	We have to stop now .
70189	0	a	Okay ,
70190	0	a	just
70191	0	a	And there is a chip in it
70192	0	a	that will
70193	0	a	 
70194	0	a	Oh .
70195	0	a	It is not saved yet .
70196	0	a	Okay .
70197	0	a	So
70198	0	a	Our beautiful drawing .
70199	0	a	Okay .
70200	0	a	So just f
70201	0	a	So this is our agenda .
70202	0	a	You are
70203	0	a	F You are going to show your pr prototype presentation after me .
70204	0	a	Oops .
70205	0	a	Okay .
70206	0	a	I did not
70207	0	a	Oh yeah .
70208	0	a	So these are the
70209	0	a	So these are the last notes we I made .
70210	0	a	Oh , okay .
70211	0	a	Yeah .
70212	1	a	If anything does not look right , just say it to me then .
70213	0	a	I do not have to put it in the report .
70214	1	a	Are we doing the the speech recognition ?
70215	0	a	Because we did not have enough time to de design the inside as well .
70216	0	a	Okay , but it is still possible financially .
70217	0	a	So if you want to , it is okay .
70218	1	a	Okay yeah .
70219	1	a	Well then then we are going to put it in .
70220	1	a	Okay , just
70221	0	a	Slide open is quite usable for remote controls .
70222	1	a	Yeah , just we have to design the inside then ,
70223	0	a	but it should be
70224	0	a	It is may maybe a bit stronger as well .
70225	0	a	Yeah , and
70226	1	a	Or are we making a slide open , like underneath ?
70227	1	a	Or fold open ?
70228	0	a	I do not know .
70229	0	a	It is probably better .
70230	0	a	Yeah , s Like underneath
70231	0	a	you can slide it open and you other functions .
70232	0	a	Maybe that is better .
70233	0	a	Yeah .
70234	0	a	Yeah , that is that is a very good point .
70235	0	a	Okay , so when you have a lot of room inside .
70236	0	a	Think that is better .
70237	0	a	So you can make it very easy to use .
70238	0	a	Cause you can write a lot of comments besides it .
70239	0	a	Yeah .
70240	0	a	Okay .
70241	0	a	So this is okay ?
70242	0	a	Okay ,
70243	0	a	so that is
70244	1	a	I will just have a look how much that is .
70245	0	a	No .
70246	0	a	Yeah , we are going to use the advanced chip then .
70247	0	a	The
70248	0	a	Yeah , I I think so .
70249	0	a	But Okay , for the Okay .
70250	0	a	Advanced chip was for spee
70251	0	a	Yeah .
70252	0	a	I do not know .
70253	0	a	No , you have a different chip for speech recognition .
70254	0	a	So So I already calculated that and it is still in the budget .
70255	0	a	Okay .
70256	0	a	okay .
70257	0	a	So it is okay .
70258	0	a	Good .
70259	1	a	So you can show your prototype if you want to .
70260	1	a	Yeah .
70261	1	a	Together ?
70262	1	a	I will give comments .
70263	0	a	Yeah , it is Let is do it together .
70264	0	a	Okay .
70265	0	a	Yeah , we just made a Word file with the basic elements .
70266	0	a	the look and feel model .
70267	0	a	well the form , the case as drawn there .
70268	0	a	Simply a square with round corners .
70269	0	a	So that is basically it .
70270	1	a	the material should be hard plastic .
70271	1	a	colour changeable , and also transparent .
70272	1	a	And colour and transparent , or just transparent ,
70273	0	a	I do not know .
70274	0	a	then the elements .
70275	0	a	we have
70276	0	a	The functions are just basic .
70277	0	a	Like I have pointed them here .
70278	0	a	Mute function , on off function , text functions .
70279	0	a	This switch channel .
70280	0	a	Okay , cool .
70281	0	a	And this is the the num pad .
70282	0	a	And the logo is over here , and the mic .
70283	0	a	Okay .
70284	0	a	And the scrollwheel , no ?
70285	0	a	You operate that with your pointing finger .
70286	0	a	Means
70287	0	a	Okay .
70288	0	a	So you hold it like this in your right hand
70289	0	a	and I dunno .
70290	0	a	So how many functions do you need for for the microphone ?
70291	0	a	Yeah , speech recognition .
70292	0	a	Speech recognition .
70293	0	a	Just
70294	0	a	Only one button to say it is on or off .
70295	0	a	I did not have a specification of that .
70296	0	a	But I can imagine that you have to input your voice or something .
70297	0	a	so I have
70298	0	a	Yes , you need options to configure it , and after that you do not need them anymore .
70299	0	a	Yeah , maybe maybe you have to configure it .
70300	1	a	So you can put it on the back as well if you want to .
70301	0	a	Yeah , you can put them all on the back .
70302	0	a	Yeah , or or on the slide function , I do not know .
70303	0	a	That is for sure .
70304	0	a	Okay .
70305	0	a	That is
70306	0	a	We also do not know how many buttons are required , or what kind of buttons .
70307	0	a	Well we have not had time to design that , the slide pad .
70308	0	a	But
70309	0	a	You have a lot of room if you can slide it open .
70310	1	a	Yeah , you can put it separate .
70311	0	a	You
70312	0	a	Yeah I know .
70313	0	a	I can imagine you need at least four buttons or something .
70314	0	a	So But it is enough room .
70315	0	a	Yeah .
70316	0	a	the position ?
70317	0	a	Yeah , you write
70318	0	a	You wrote this , so .
70319	0	a	well
70320	0	a	Well the main , the main zap buttons are most central .
70321	0	a	That was the the most important thing .
70322	0	a	So the best place ,
70323	0	a	the best reach place on off buttons , text buttons , mute buttons are together and at a place they easily are , easy to find .
70324	0	a	the on off button is a bit bigger , so it stands out .
70325	0	a	That way you do not have to make it red , cause it is will will show up .
70326	0	a	scrollwheel is on the left side .
70327	0	a	It is basically the be standard place for scrollwheel , as far as I know .
70328	0	a	Yeah .
70329	0	a	But it is not impossible to use it , if you are left handed .
70330	0	a	So y Because you can use your thumb then .
70331	0	a	Yeah .
70332	1	a	Just just one thing now .
70333	0	a	y you need to have more one two th
70334	0	a	You have got one
70335	0	a	two three four five
70336	0	a	six seven eight nine .
70337	0	a	Okay yeah ,
70338	0	a	they
70339	0	a	Yeah okay .
70340	0	a	But you missed the no the zero and the two stripes .
70341	0	a	yeah .
70342	0	a	That is that is below that then .
70343	0	a	Yeah , okay .
70344	0	a	It is twelve buttons .
70345	0	a	just so you get that .
70346	0	a	Okay ,
70347	0	a	but It is rather important .
70348	0	a	Yeah okay , just we just missed that .
70349	0	a	Yeah .
70350	0	a	But I will just
70351	1	a	I will get back to later .
70352	0	a	F the form
70353	0	a	well , we have taken that from the iPod , other popular technical device .
70354	0	a	So should be popular .
70355	0	a	The f the buttons creating ?
70356	1	a	if you
70357	0	a	That or all round shapes , not rounded corners .
70358	0	a	Okay .
70359	0	a	So that , you know , you get a bit round feeling .
70360	0	a	we will use hard plastic .
70361	0	a	Since that allows us to use two D buttons , non rubber buttons .
70362	0	a	Colour changeable .
70363	0	a	Well and the backlight thing , the thing that lights up .
70364	0	a	We have decided in the the channel buttons , there is a little colour around it .
70365	0	a	Okay .
70366	0	a	And also in the num pads , there is also colour light behind it .
70367	0	a	And do you still can , do you still can choose what colour , kind of colour you want ?
70368	1	a	How do you want to implement that ?
70369	0	a	Just on the
70370	1	a	Maybe on the second level as well ?
70371	1	a	Okay , just draw draw the second level , because we need that as well .
70372	0	a	So when you pre
70373	0	a	Yeah .
70374	0	a	We are going to implement .
70375	0	a	Yeah .
70376	0	a	just a little
70377	0	a	Yeah .
70378	0	a	Yeah , these are just basic functions , so All the non basic are in
70379	1	a	Okay .
70380	1	a	Okay , maybe we use this button for the
70381	0	a	Yeah .
70382	0	a	Okay , there is one function I use daily , and it is not on the basic functions .
70383	0	a	It is to switch to your Scart .
70384	0	a	Play Station or DVD player .
70385	0	a	That function must be
70386	0	a	Yeah , maybe
70387	1	a	Or you can i lay it beneath in the other functions .
70388	0	a	Yeah ,
70389	0	a	I
70390	0	a	To your video device .
70391	0	a	Yeah , as well .
70392	0	a	Just make make a
70393	1	a	Just just draw a second level one and say all options that are still left or something .
70394	0	a	A second level ?
70395	0	a	Like a a new blank one or Or just here ?
70396	0	a	Okay .
70397	0	a	Yeah .
70398	0	a	Yeah .
70399	0	a	No no , just on Down there .
70400	0	a	Is i okay .
70401	0	a	So Just if you s
70402	0	a	Yeah , y Maybe , yeah .
70403	0	a	Yeah .
70404	0	a	And h how does the second level come out ?
70405	0	a	it slides along ?
70406	0	a	From from the beneath ?
70407	1	a	Menu ?
70408	1	a	Scart ?
70409	0	a	yeah .
70410	0	a	slides I think .
70411	0	a	It is
70412	0	a	You can do it that it claps open ,
70413	0	a	but I think that is not solid enough .
70414	0	a	For the bottom .
70415	0	a	No , you gotta slide it .
70416	0	a	If that breaks then you are screwed .
70417	0	a	Yeah , it is right .
70418	0	a	So it do does not even have to slide all the way open .
70419	1	a	i the the speech functions buttons .
70420	1	a	So what do we need ?
70421	0	a	Yeah ,
70422	0	a	just
70423	0	a	God damn it .
70424	0	a	Menu button .
70425	1	a	With maybe arrows .
70426	0	a	So you can scroll in the , navigate the menu .
70427	0	a	I think we can even put a
70428	0	a	We have one for the zero and one for the for the more digit channels .
70429	0	a	And so y you keep you keep one , you have one left .
70430	0	a	So you have one left for the Right , the video channel , Play Station , etcetera .
70431	0	a	Yes .
70432	0	a	So this is the
70433	0	a	Extern or something .
70434	0	a	That is used pretty often .
70435	0	a	Yeah .
70436	0	a	If you have a Play Station , you use it every day .
70437	0	a	It is a f basic
70438	0	a	Yeah , to navigate .
70439	0	a	Yeah .
70440	1	a	You want to save that file as well ?
70441	1	a	The drawing ?
70442	0	a	Does not really matter .
70443	0	a	That was it .
70444	0	a	So here are multiple speech buttons , I do not know how many .
70445	0	a	It does not really matter .
70446	0	a	I do not know the functions .
70447	0	a	Just just
70448	0	a	Yeah .
70449	0	a	That is
70450	0	a	Yeah well we do not have any
70451	0	a	What else ?
70452	0	a	menu buttons with arrows .
70453	0	a	Okay .
70454	0	a	What else ?
70455	0	a	What else ?
70456	0	a	menu .
70457	0	a	With arrows .
70458	0	a	S Just like
70459	0	a	I think it is best if we do .
70460	0	a	where do we have
70461	1	a	Or there .
70462	0	a	Like a normal Yeah , with in the middle a menu button .
70463	0	a	Like on the normal Like this .
70464	0	a	The menu button , yes .
70465	0	a	Okay .
70466	0	a	Well we do not have any , anything on how many buttons speech requires .
70467	0	a	So you ca not redesign it .
70468	0	a	okay .
70469	1	a	Maybe one button to switch the colour of your LEDs ?
70470	0	a	and and you can hold it ,
70471	1	a	you can hold it , and then the colours switch or multiple multiple buttons .
70472	0	a	Yeah .
70473	0	a	Yep .
70474	0	a	Yeah .
70475	1	a	Just press it once , the colour should switch .
70476	1	a	Press again , the colour switch again maybe ?
70477	0	a	Yep .
70478	0	a	okay .
70479	1	a	Or we just make it three buttons , all the colours on it .
70480	1	a	Just red , yel red , green and
70481	0	a	That is that is very easy , yeah .
70482	0	a	Okay , yeah .
70483	0	a	Th Yeah .
70484	1	a	If we have enough place , then we can do that .
70485	0	a	Yeah , okay .
70486	1	a	We can put those here .
70487	0	a	Colour buttons .
70488	1	a	And then we choose green , blue and red or
70489	0	a	Okay .
70490	0	a	Yeah .
70491	0	a	Okay .
70492	0	a	Okay .
70493	0	a	That is It
70494	1	a	Some text buttons .
70495	1	a	So did we miss anything ?
70496	0	a	Okay .
70497	1	a	Yeah , maybe some some text next to the scroll wheel , that it is volume .
70498	0	a	Yeah .
70499	0	a	Yeah , but
70500	0	a	there is one there is one text button
70501	0	a	I
70502	0	a	There is one text button I prefer .
70503	0	a	I just The volume logo .
70504	0	a	No , ma on on o on the on the
70505	0	a	Yeah .
70506	0	a	Oh wh Here ?
70507	0	a	Okay .
70508	0	a	Yeah .
70509	1	a	Just make it
70510	1	a	Yeah , just put it on those extra f extra function as well .
70511	0	a	Yeah , or th or the
70512	0	a	Yeah .
70513	0	a	That is the one that you use if you search for a page , like seven hundred , and it is counting from one hundred to two hundred , you will switch to your television and back to text .
70514	0	a	Yeah , we have that on the the text button .
70515	0	a	Do you do you
70516	0	a	Did you think of that ?
70517	0	a	Ex Yeah .
70518	0	a	Yep .
70519	0	a	Yeah , but then you can switch back to normal telete teletext .
70520	0	a	You just switch it off and then
70521	1	a	Well w we thought of a text button .
70522	0	a	why not ?
70523	0	a	No
70524	0	a	Whoa
70525	0	a	I think
70526	0	a	Yeah , the three stages .
70527	0	a	Yeah .
70528	0	a	And if you press it again , you get the the the through view .
70529	0	a	The sta the state you
70530	0	a	Yeah .
70531	0	a	Oh just three stages ,
70532	0	a	you
70533	0	a	Yeah , that is okay .
70534	0	a	Yeah , b
70535	0	a	but but if you are in the second stage , the third stage is switch teletext off .
70536	0	a	Yes .
70537	0	a	So you can switch back from second to w first .
70538	0	a	No , it does not have to turn it off .
70539	0	a	No .
70540	0	a	Just do not
70541	0	a	Yeah .
70542	0	a	Just remember where it was .
70543	0	a	It it does not clear the the page .
70544	0	a	If you if you turn teletext on , you you set the seven hundred , and you turn it off , then the next time you turn it on , it still stays on seven hundred ?
70545	0	a	But maybe it is not the way
70546	0	a	Yes , that is to remember .
70547	0	a	Okay , okay .
70548	0	a	Yeah , but that is that is
70549	0	a	That is a functionality for the television .
70550	0	a	I dunno
70551	0	a	if Yeah , I think as well ,
70552	0	a	but yeah .
70553	1	a	That is maybe one thing we can discuss about .
70554	0	a	Yeah nee
70555	0	a	No ,
70556	0	a	if i
70557	0	a	the remote can send like the the code for seven hundred , page seven hundred to the television .
70558	0	a	Yeah ,
70559	0	a	in thi the the remote control in the the chip .
70560	0	a	Th th th if you switch it on .
70561	0	a	Okay .
70562	0	a	Yeah , but you have to search every time again .
70563	0	a	Th i
70564	0	a	Yeah , I dunno .
70565	0	a	That is what what happening if you do it like that .
70566	0	a	Yeah , that is true .
70567	0	a	But it is still the television that has to do that .
70568	0	a	Okay .
70569	0	a	So yeah .
70570	0	a	do we need to fix that or
70571	0	a	Just like your telephone , hard plastic .
70572	0	a	most new TVs do collect all the pages .
70573	0	a	No , that is what the television does .
70574	0	a	Yeah , those memory functions .
70575	0	a	But not not every every television , so
70576	1	a	Yeah , I I thought about one thing .
70577	0	a	Yeah .
70578	0	a	Okay , it is cool .
70579	0	a	Was this logo for volume ?
70580	0	a	Okay .
70581	0	a	Yeah , that is fine .
70582	0	a	So that is it ?
70583	0	a	Is this prich pretty much it , yeah ?
70584	0	a	It is too expensive to make it from a different material anyway .
70585	0	a	the buttons ?
70586	0	a	from which material are they now ?
70587	0	a	Okay .
70588	0	a	No no
70589	0	a	Yeah .
70590	0	a	Just hard plastic .
70591	0	a	So
70592	0	a	I think just Yeah , but
70593	0	a	I think you have that problem more often with rubber buttons .
70594	0	a	Because if you use it a couple of years , some sometimes the numbers on the on the buttons are slide away ,
70595	0	a	are
70596	1	a	And maybe we can write the numbers below or above ?
70597	0	a	Or shall we just turn it on on the buttons ?
70598	0	a	Well yeah .
70599	1	a	I think just on the buttons .
70600	0	a	If you do it abo above or below , it takes more space .
70601	0	a	That is too much place .
70602	0	a	Okay , just leave it .
70603	0	a	I do not think the space is worth it .
70604	0	a	Just leave it .
70605	0	a	Yeah , and i The most time
70606	0	a	Yeah , with rubber buttons .
70607	0	a	Yeah , okay .
70608	0	a	Okay .
70609	0	a	Fine .
70610	0	a	Yeah ?
70611	0	a	Okay , cool .
70612	0	a	Yeah , I do not know what this means .
70613	0	a	But I think we just evela evaluated this one .
70614	0	a	Yeah , I made some criteria , so we can ev evaluate our model .
70615	0	a	Oh okay , you made some criteria .
70616	0	a	Okay , cool .
70617	0	a	Okay .
70618	0	a	I d d d I do not think if it is right .
70619	1	a	That shall show it .
70620	0	a	You have some usability criteria or
70621	0	a	Okay .
70622	1	a	no , all criterias we just argue about .
70623	0	a	Oh .
70624	0	a	In the bottom .
70625	0	a	Yeah .
70626	0	a	Look and feel ?
70627	0	a	Okay .
70628	0	a	Evaluation crit Yeah , evaluation presentation .
70629	0	a	No , evaluation is
70630	0	a	Yeah
70631	0	a	beautiful is is also a matter of taste .
70632	0	a	It is not in .
70633	0	a	d it does not matter
70634	0	a	It only had two pages or something .
70635	0	a	well I looked in the reports from the marketing strategy , or of the the the the the the new needs and the market .
70636	0	a	The Italians , how they think about it .
70637	0	a	And
70638	0	a	The research about the the comp the the the users and that kind of stuff .
70639	0	a	I made some criteria ,
70640	1	a	and we have to test the criteria from one to zero .
70641	1	a	We sh we
70642	1	a	we we can give it a number , and then we can give ourself an average for our model .
70643	0	a	And this
70644	0	a	These are all I I I found , or I wrote down .
70645	0	a	Okay .
70646	1	a	And we have to discuss about , if we give it a one or a seven .
70647	0	a	Yes .
70648	0	a	I think if you have a kind of iPod idea .
70649	0	a	It quite beautiful .
70650	0	a	It is We are actu
70651	0	a	We are the
70652	0	a	Flashy .
70653	0	a	Yeah , the the the difference be between beautiful and fancy look and feel is the the the outside beautiful like the iPod or something .
70654	0	a	And fancy is more like the f the flashing lights and the colours and and that kind of stuff .
70655	0	a	Okay .
70656	0	a	Well I think we do
70657	0	a	If it is really , if you can if you can get the iPod look , then it is beautiful , I think .
70658	0	a	The LEDs .
70659	0	a	Yes .
70660	1	a	And and what ki what kind of what kind of basic colours were you thought of ?
70661	1	a	The basic colours are black or green or yellow ?
70662	0	a	Or you have not thought about
70663	0	a	Ho how do we make
70664	0	a	Black and yellow .
70665	0	a	But
70666	0	a	It is black .
70667	0	a	basic colours ,
70668	0	a	yeah .
70669	0	a	Well you did not say .
70670	1	a	Maybe company colours ?
70671	0	a	Black .
70672	1	a	Yeah , yellow light .
70673	1	a	A bit a bit of yellow .
70674	0	a	Can
70675	1	a	Black white , maybe ?
70676	0	a	Because
70677	0	a	Okay , so what number do we give a beautiful ?
70678	0	a	Beautiful is really subjective , because it has to do lots with the colours .
70679	0	a	Do we have yellow light ?
70680	0	a	No , not really ,
70681	0	a	but it is possible .
70682	0	a	Not not not yellow , but just a bit of light yellow .
70683	0	a	It is
70684	1	a	Yeah , different colours .
70685	0	a	Like white , also ni or always nice .
70686	1	a	And what colours should the buttons be ?
70687	0	a	But can you change those too , with the switch ?
70688	0	a	Okay .
70689	0	a	This is
70690	1	a	Oh , the same as th th the cover .
70691	0	a	Just
70692	0	a	Yes .
70693	1	a	But also th the light behind it .
70694	0	a	No , no .
70695	0	a	Make them
70696	1	a	No , just make them black or grey or something .
70697	0	a	Yeah , grey .
70698	0	a	Just dark grey I think .
70699	0	a	Yeah .
70700	0	a	Well we have changeable fronts , so
70701	0	a	So
70702	0	a	Yeah .
70703	0	a	Changeable fronts , so ev for everyone for everyone it is something beautiful .
70704	0	a	Yeah ,
70705	1	a	just give it a one .
70706	1	a	It is okay .
70707	0	a	It is perfect .
70708	0	a	I think it is just what you want .
70709	0	a	Or not ?
70710	1	a	Okay , just give it a two .
70711	0	a	It is hard to decide for us , but
70712	0	a	yeah .
70713	0	a	Yeah .
70714	0	a	It is ju so subjective .
70715	0	a	It it is
70716	0	a	At least it is a lot better than current remote controls .
70717	0	a	Yeah .
70718	0	a	A two .
70719	0	a	Okay .
70720	0	a	The fancy look and feel .
70721	0	a	That is about our flashing lights and the background lights from from from the buttons .
70722	0	a	Yeah .
70723	0	a	Okay .
70724	0	a	And we can change the colours , so that is really fancy
70725	0	a	I think .
70726	0	a	Yeah .
70727	1	a	One more thing .
70728	0	a	So
70729	0	a	Slide panel ?
70730	0	a	Oh , you mean th this here ?
70731	0	a	It is pretty cool .
70732	0	a	Are w are we changing
70733	1	a	Or are they there backlights on the slide panel too ?
70734	1	a	Or n no back light ?
70735	0	a	Yeah ?
70736	1	a	And and the switch channel is There is a back light too ?
70737	0	a	Yeah .
70738	1	a	No .
70739	0	a	Not needed .
70740	1	a	No , it is only on the number , behind the numbers
70741	0	a	and
70742	0	a	That as well , yeah .
70743	0	a	Yeah , not needed I think .
70744	0	a	Yeah .
70745	0	a	Yeah , but that is unnecessary .
70746	0	a	What do I think is necessary necessary item ?
70747	0	a	Of course it is reachable .
70748	0	a	If you slide it open , it lights up .
70749	0	a	That is that is really fancy , but I do not know if it is reachable .
70750	0	a	Yeah .
70751	0	a	It does not make
70752	0	a	No .
70753	1	a	Then we do it .
70754	1	a	Okay , maybe just some light to to light it all up .
70755	0	a	So you can see what is really there .
70756	1	a	Not just not re on the buttons or something .
70757	0	a	Yeah .
70758	1	a	Just a green light or some blue light .
70759	0	a	To light it all up .
70760	0	a	Yeah ,
70761	0	a	but
70762	0	a	Okay .
70763	0	a	But Yeah .
70764	0	a	Mayb Okay .
70765	0	a	Yeah , just backlight .
70766	1	a	Not not the buttons .
70767	1	a	And th and the the normal backlights also not the buttons , but behind the buttons .
70768	0	a	Yeah .
70769	1	a	So the buttons are just grey .
70770	0	a	Well yeah .
70771	0	a	semi transparent .
70772	0	a	Yeah , just only Yeah , that is right .
70773	0	a	Okay .
70774	0	a	Okay , fine .
70775	0	a	So
70776	0	a	Yeah , that is how I think .
70777	0	a	So I I think it is very fancy .
70778	0	a	So I will give it a
70779	0	a	Yeah , and you can also choose your light , so
70780	0	a	I think it is one .
70781	0	a	Yeah , w we have done a a lot of detail in light , so
70782	0	a	Yeah .
70783	0	a	Yeah , this It is a one .
70784	0	a	It is okay .
70785	0	a	It is cool .
70786	0	a	Okay , next .
70787	0	a	This is a difficult one , because we we do not
70788	0	a	Yeah , we do not know it about the
70789	0	a	it is it is very easy to use , but the second layer is not easy to use .
70790	0	a	Learnable ?
70791	0	a	Easy to use ?
70792	1	a	Yeah , we shall test it
70793	0	a	But
70794	0	a	Yeah .
70795	0	a	Yeah .
70796	0	a	It is That is
70797	0	a	No .
70798	0	a	No , but you do not have to use that .
70799	0	a	And you on do not have to pay attention to that second layer .
70800	0	a	That is th that is the main thing that is so good about it .
70801	0	a	So I think it is easy to use ,
70802	0	a	but
70803	0	a	And learnable is a bit
70804	0	a	Well y just f
70805	0	a	Yeah , I think it is very clear what it all does .
70806	0	a	Learnable ?
70807	0	a	It is not not as fast as a usual remote control .
70808	0	a	Well , I think it is .
70809	0	a	Because because I think I think the scroll wheel , it is very handy , but the first time you get this thing in your hands , it is not to use the scroll wheel .
70810	0	a	I think you must seek for it , and up or down or
70811	0	a	then the re
70812	0	a	Yeah .
70813	0	a	But the rest of it is very easy ,
70814	0	a	because there are so so n
70815	0	a	So it is learnable
70816	0	a	f
70817	0	a	i i
70818	0	a	In the first place it is very easy to use .
70819	0	a	So so few information that you can easily decide what buttons w for what function .
70820	0	a	Yes .
70821	0	a	Okay .
70822	0	a	But the second parts , like speech , etcetera , that will be harder to learn .
70823	0	a	Okay .
70824	0	a	But
70825	0	a	Yeah .
70826	0	a	It is Yeah it is
70827	0	a	Device .
70828	0	a	And I think its scrollwheel is u easy to use as well , if you have ever used a different kind of of device .
70829	0	a	But we we have got the two so two two or three new things , huh ?
70830	0	a	And maybe we maybe learnable is in compare of old fashion remote controls .
70831	0	a	So we h we have speech , the scroll wheel , and the the the slide .
70832	0	a	You must slide it .
70833	0	a	And that is not normal at the normal remote controls .
70834	0	a	Cause I think learnable is a l a less than easy to use .
70835	0	a	But
70836	0	a	yeah .
70837	0	a	Because easy to use comes after learnable .
70838	0	a	Okay .
70839	0	a	Okay , just Easy to use is very cool ,
70840	1	a	so just give it a two .
70841	0	a	I
70842	0	a	I think it a three or something .
70843	0	a	Maybe three then .
70844	0	a	Learnable is
70845	0	a	Yeah okay .
70846	0	a	No , but definitely better , much better than than than avera average , yeah .
70847	0	a	The normal .
70848	0	a	Yeah .
70849	0	a	And the one you showed is just all buttons and you do not know
70850	0	a	Yeah .
70851	0	a	Yep , true .
70852	0	a	Then a two .
70853	0	a	Oh .
70854	0	a	Okay .
70855	0	a	Okay .
70856	0	a	New features .
70857	0	a	Techno technological innovative ?
70858	0	a	The speech function is new .
70859	0	a	The speech function and the colour .
70860	0	a	And the scrollwheel , backlights , slide .
70861	0	a	Colour .
70862	0	a	The scrollwheel and the slide .
70863	0	a	I think the slide is pretty new .
70864	0	a	Slide is not n is is not new .
70865	0	a	No .
70866	0	a	I already have a
70867	0	a	I already have a VCR and it is about from nineteen eighty eight .
70868	0	a	I only saw it in a telephone , not in an remote control .
70869	0	a	Okay .
70870	0	a	And they all have a slide in it .
70871	0	a	So that is not new .
70872	0	a	But also slide that buttons come out , as well ?
70873	0	a	Okay .
70874	0	a	Yeah .
70875	0	a	Okay , and the the the lightning ?
70876	0	a	Is that new ?
70877	0	a	The lighting is new .
70878	0	a	That is cool .
70879	0	a	Yeah
70880	0	a	for a for a f
70881	0	a	There are no games on it , that is that is It is not a one , it is a two again .
70882	0	a	it is pretty new , I think .
70883	0	a	Yes .
70884	0	a	Scrollwheel .
70885	0	a	Speech ?
70886	0	a	Yeah , different fronts for a remote control ,
70887	0	a	I think that is new too .
70888	0	a	Speech is new .
70889	0	a	Different colours , so
70890	0	a	Yeah .
70891	0	a	Yeah .
70892	0	a	So we have a pretty new
70893	0	a	It is it is it is not not LCD or something .
70894	0	a	That would And we did not
70895	0	a	But then we also have the the home station .
70896	0	a	If you have
70897	0	a	Yeah .
70898	0	a	We are forgetting about that now , but
70899	0	a	We do not recharge .
70900	0	a	Uh oh .
70901	0	a	Oh yeah , that is right .
70902	0	a	Home station .
70903	0	a	Rechargeable .
70904	0	a	Yeah , we did not draw that too , but
70905	0	a	Yeah , that is just a normal th s simple thing .
70906	0	a	But that is more like now .
70907	1	a	Yeah , just draw it afterwards .
70908	0	a	I do not know .
70909	0	a	If you
70910	1	a	Can you save it on the same , in the same map as the other ones ?
70911	1	a	In the the project map ?
70912	0	a	Yeah .
70913	0	a	Just save , save as ?
70914	0	a	Okay .
70915	0	a	save as ?
70916	0	a	No , that is not in the project .
70917	0	a	Well it is a already in the folder .
70918	0	a	L like number seven .
70919	0	a	Oh yeah , okay .
70920	0	a	Yeah .
70921	0	a	Smart board .
70922	0	a	Yeah , but this one .
70923	0	a	This one is not yet in the
70924	0	a	Oh oh .
70925	0	a	I think it is .
70926	0	a	Yeah , it is .
70927	0	a	No , I think it is .
70928	0	a	untitled ?
70929	0	a	Yeah , it does not matter .
70930	0	a	Save .
70931	0	a	Okay .
70932	0	a	all the the seven , all the seven .
70933	1	a	But you still have to draw the resi the recharger .
70934	0	a	Okay .
70935	0	a	And new features , so we give it a two or also again a one ?
70936	0	a	No , I think i if you have games on it , then then you give you have a one .
70937	0	a	No , we are not extraordinary new or something .
70938	0	a	But not
70939	0	a	No , just so it is still a two .
70940	0	a	Tha tha that
70941	0	a	No ,
70942	0	a	we we we searched for a young group , audience , beneath f forty .
70943	0	a	two , I think .
70944	0	a	N
70945	0	a	Targeted audience .
70946	0	a	we are the targeted audience ?
70947	0	a	Do we like it ?
70948	0	a	Yeah , but l younger than forty .
70949	0	a	Yes .
70950	0	a	So we we are exactly the targeted group .
70951	0	a	Yeah , but did we reach , with our style , the targeted audience ?
70952	0	a	Th that is my question .
70953	0	a	I think so , yeah .
70954	0	a	You get the fancy things for younger people .
70955	0	a	And you get the the aesthetic things for older people .
70956	0	a	Yeah .
70957	0	a	We have got a one for fancy look and feel , and that is what attracts the young audience .
70958	0	a	So you want
70959	0	a	Yeah , you get different colours .
70960	0	a	Yeah .
70961	0	a	So think that is a two or a one .
70962	0	a	Yeah .
70963	0	a	the only point is that we do not have That is that is That is this question .
70964	0	a	Yeah ,
70965	0	a	but s it
70966	0	a	That is basically not not handy .
70967	0	a	And I do not thi
70968	0	a	I do not see
70969	0	a	Yeah .
70970	0	a	Yeah , this .
70971	0	a	So we targeted it ?
70972	0	a	But we did not follow the latest trends .
70973	0	a	Yeah .
70974	0	a	No .
70975	1	a	Yeah , you could make a a front a front that is that is like like a banana , or something .
70976	0	a	I think we followed the latest trends .
70977	0	a	Tha these are the only latest trends I get on my computer .
70978	0	a	Oh right .
70979	0	a	Well fruit and vegetables , yeah .
70980	0	a	You can different front
70981	0	a	This is a a power indicator .
70982	0	a	yeah , th
70983	0	a	So we had we have a fruit
70984	0	a	Oh yeah .
70985	0	a	So
70986	0	a	Oh .
70987	1	a	Like a a f banana kind of front .
70988	0	a	But spongy will never be .
70989	0	a	No .
70990	1	a	So we give ourself a three or something .
70991	0	a	Yeah .
70992	0	a	Okay .
70993	0	a	So that is eleven .
70994	0	a	That is
70995	0	a	What is the average ?
70996	0	a	A perfect score .
70997	0	a	Eleven divided by six .
70998	0	a	It is
70999	0	a	Yeah , it is one point eight three .
71000	0	a	No , I do not know .
71001	0	a	We are not too hard on ourselves .
71002	0	a	Okay .
71003	0	a	So you can see how far it is charged up .
71004	1	a	And and you need n a button to call it , to let it beep .
71005	0	a	Okay .
71006	0	a	To call .
71007	0	a	Okay .
71008	0	a	Oh yeah , that is still
71009	1	a	Yeah , maybe we have to skip that one .
71010	0	a	Call That is
71011	0	a	Yeah ,
71012	0	a	but it
71013	0	a	No , we need that .
71014	0	a	Yeah , but we have to make a speaker then too .
71015	0	a	If you want to make it beep .
71016	0	a	No no , I want that in .
71017	1	a	But we can we can do it underneath the logo .
71018	0	a	That is usable .
71019	0	a	If you do
71020	0	a	Yeah , okay .
71021	0	a	That is really usable .
71022	0	a	Okay .
71023	0	a	Yeah , th the speaker is very small as well ,
71024	0	a	right ?
71025	0	a	Yes .
71026	0	a	It is
71027	0	a	Yeah .
71028	1	a	So I just got a financial
71029	0	a	You s saved it or
71030	0	a	No .
71031	0	a	I did save it .
71032	1	a	Okay , let is have a look at this one here , the production cost of it .
71033	1	a	If I forgot anything , just say it to me .
71034	0	a	It just is a battery .
71035	0	a	Yeah , there are some that they did not mention , because recharge is not on the list .
71036	0	a	But okay .
71037	0	a	So I think we are pretty much in the right direction , because it is twelve point three Euros .
71038	0	a	okay .
71039	0	a	But is
71040	0	a	Okay .
71041	0	a	That is fine .
71042	0	a	So this is a regular chip incl and and a sample speaker .
71043	0	a	So that is both .
71044	0	a	Come on , it is perfect .
71045	0	a	twelve point three point three .
71046	0	a	Yeah , and single curved curved .
71047	0	a	But but is it inc
71048	0	a	Does it include a a homestation or Can we make that for h twenty cents ?
71049	0	a	Yeah .
71050	0	a	No , that is not on the list .
71051	0	a	But that should not be .
71052	0	a	Yeah , we can different fronts , but standard front wo not be , yeah .
71053	0	a	Probably .
71054	0	a	I just
71055	0	a	The b the button supplements , I did not I
71056	0	a	d I was wondering if this special colour maybe was
71057	0	a	I am not sure .
71058	0	a	See it is
71059	0	a	I think it is okay like this .
71060	0	a	Special form , yeah .
71061	0	a	It is hard to say .
71062	0	a	But maybe we have to
71063	0	a	Yeah , okay .
71064	0	a	Special colour , you can skip this one , because it is all quite normal .
71065	0	a	Yeah .
71066	0	a	We get different ones , that is all .
71067	0	a	So you can put a recharger in it as well .
71068	0	a	But this is expensive , the sample speaker .
71069	0	a	This ?
71070	0	a	Oh , them .
71071	0	a	Yeah .
71072	0	a	Yeah , it is four .
71073	0	a	Four .
71074	0	a	It is four Euros .
71075	0	a	Is that included ?
71076	0	a	In the twelve Euro or
71077	0	a	Okay , then we then we need to use it .
71078	0	a	Yeah .
71079	0	a	So we are
71080	0	a	Okay .
71081	0	a	Yeah , that is included .
71082	0	a	It is kind of weird that we we get this information now , afterwards .
71083	0	a	Because
71084	0	a	Sure .
71085	0	a	Yeah , no .
71086	0	a	Yeah .
71087	0	a	Okay , so this is pretty much it this .
71088	0	a	Damn , solar cells are expensive .
71089	0	a	So I just want you
71090	0	a	Yeah , we just made it .
71091	1	a	So we can do the project evalu evaluation now for for everything together .
71092	0	a	Okay .
71093	1	a	We can do some discussion about this .
71094	0	a	Was there room for creativity ?
71095	0	a	Paul , was there room for crea creativity ?
71096	0	a	Yeah .
71097	0	a	Yes .
71098	0	a	Okay .
71099	0	a	Beautiful .
71100	0	a	i
71101	0	a	Yeah , I think so .
71102	0	a	I think everyone already .
71103	0	a	So I think we discussed a lot of things about it .
71104	0	a	Yeah m If we got a high mark for innovativeness or innovativity then there we probably have been creative .
71105	0	a	Or a different style .
71106	0	a	So Of course there was .
71107	0	a	Yeah .
71108	0	a	Yeah .
71109	0	a	We could make a lot of different remote controls .
71110	0	a	Yeah .
71111	0	a	So it is creativity .
71112	0	a	Huh .
71113	0	a	Okay , so the leadership
71114	0	a	Was there a leadership and
71115	0	a	Okay .
71116	0	a	What do you have to say about that ?
71117	0	a	I dunno .
71118	0	a	No , I think
71119	0	a	Yeah .
71120	0	a	Who was the leader ?
71121	0	a	Yeah yeah .
71122	0	a	Just normal discussion , I think .
71123	0	a	Not one leader or something .
71124	0	a	Yeah .
71125	0	a	One leader to check the time , etcetera .
71126	0	a	Yeah .
71127	0	a	And make notes .
71128	0	a	Yeah , I know .
71129	0	a	So more like a secretary .
71130	0	a	Yeah .
71131	0	a	Okay , next one .
71132	0	a	team work
71133	0	a	The
71134	0	a	the third meeting I think that one was pretty hard .
71135	0	a	We were not all We were not agree with every not agree with .
71136	0	a	We were not finished .
71137	0	a	Yeah , w we had so much information , that we get through email and just
71138	0	a	Yeah .
71139	0	a	We are not finished .
71140	0	a	I think we we got wrong information at the wrong time .
71141	0	a	I think that was the m biggest problem .
71142	0	a	Yeah .
71143	0	a	Like the prices .
71144	0	a	If we knew that before , we could have had discussion really s really quicker .
71145	0	a	Yeah , th that is weird .
71146	0	a	Yeah , because the prices could be twenty Euros or something now .
71147	0	a	Yeah , and if you had fifteen Euros , then we would it .
71148	0	a	And then
71149	0	a	Yeah .
71150	0	a	We had to
71151	0	a	Yeah .
71152	0	a	yeah .
71153	0	a	Yeah , finance .
71154	0	a	So we are bacal basically just lucky to get the price right .
71155	0	a	But the teamwork was okay .
71156	0	a	Yeah , everybody could speak their opinion .
71157	0	a	And
71158	0	a	Yeah .
71159	0	a	I think everyone listen to each other .
71160	0	a	Yeah .
71161	0	a	Like marketing said things and then we had to i include them in the design .
71162	0	a	Yeah .
71163	0	a	Kay .
71164	1	a	Yeah , what I have to say about means .
71165	0	a	The smart board is okay .
71166	0	a	Digital pen is horrible .
71167	0	a	I dunno if you use it .
71168	0	a	But if you want to download it to your computer , it is does not work .
71169	0	a	It was
71170	0	a	Just does not work .
71171	0	a	No .
71172	0	a	Well smart board would be very nice to work with , if it worked really well .
71173	0	a	Digital pen or
71174	0	a	Yeah , the drawings are are hard to make , I think .
71175	0	a	Yeah .
71176	0	a	Yeah , i if if it would be faster , it would be great .
71177	0	a	Just not work too slow .
71178	0	a	Yeah , more accurate .
71179	0	a	Yeah , it is i
71180	0	a	It should be more accurate .
71181	0	a	Precise .
71182	0	a	Yeah .
71183	0	a	And I think it would be great if you could edit it from , just with a mouse , from where you are sitting .
71184	0	a	Yeah .
71185	0	a	Not just pointing out on it .
71186	0	a	It is the same for the presenta for the presentations .
71187	0	a	You can do it from here .
71188	0	a	That is much easier than standing there .
71189	0	a	Yeah .
71190	0	a	And so you have
71191	0	a	Yeah .
71192	0	a	Yeah , and p just point with a mouse .
71193	0	a	No use to draw on the board itself .
71194	0	a	It is just slows down .
71195	0	a	Yeah .
71196	0	a	Just old fashioned kind of blackboard style .
71197	0	a	Yeah .
71198	0	a	But you might as well do it in normal computer style .
71199	0	a	Yeah ,
71200	0	a	like .
71201	0	a	Yeah , even harder to draw like this than black board style .
71202	0	a	Yeah .
71203	0	a	Yeah .
71204	0	a	And it is far too slow this way .
71205	0	a	Yeah .
71206	0	a	Okay .
71207	0	a	You cou You could draw on it , but not as main function .
71208	0	a	No .
71209	0	a	I think
71210	0	a	Yeah , okay .
71211	0	a	Digital pen .
71212	0	a	So we made it in time .
71213	0	a	And we made a remote control .
71214	0	a	We did it .
71215	0	a	In the budget , yeah .
71216	0	a	New ideas found .
71217	0	a	New ideas .
71218	0	a	What is that ?
71219	0	a	Oh
71220	0	a	I just think if we
71221	0	a	I dunno .
71222	0	a	For for for
71223	0	a	To gather , or to work together , or new ideas for
71224	0	a	No , for the prototype .
71225	0	a	I do not know what it mean .
71226	0	a	Just
71227	0	a	For remote control probably .
71228	0	a	No , for the project .
71229	0	a	For remote control , a favourite for your text .
71230	0	a	New ideas .
71231	0	a	Yeah , but still , you could not make a fancy a f you could not make a a prototype out of this .
71232	0	a	Because we do not have any sizes and Yeah , but
71233	0	a	it
71234	0	a	You ca not possibly do that in such a short time , I think .
71235	0	a	Yeah .
71236	0	a	But it is for the next team .
71237	0	a	We do not have to do that .
71238	0	a	That is for .
71239	0	a	Yeah , this this is just the idea phase ,
71240	0	a	the
71241	0	a	Yeah .
71242	0	a	Yeah , just brainstorming basically .
71243	0	a	Details
71244	0	a	Quite early .
71245	0	a	So are we finished ?
71246	0	a	Okay .
71247	0	a	Yes ,
71248	1	a	I think just I just write a final report .
71249	0	a	Yeah .
71250	0	a	No ,
71251	0	a	we have only four minutes left .
71252	0	a	it is okay .
71253	0	a	Oh okay .
71254	0	a	Oh , what do we have to do now .
71255	0	a	Do we
71256	0	a	I thought we were done at four o'clock ?
71257	0	a	Yep .
71258	0	a	It is now quarter past three .
71259	0	a	So
71260	0	a	Yeah .
71261	1	a	I should take some pictures .
71262	0	a	Okay .
71263	1	a	we can do it afterwards , so
71264	0	a	Yeah .
71265	0	a	Yes .
71266	1	a	Let is play minesweeper .
71267	0	a	I found it as well .
71268	0	a	Ti din ti din .
71269	0	a	One two three four five six seven cameras .
71270	0	a	not bad .
71271	0	a	So that was it .
71272	1	a	Now we can look at this .
71273	0	a	This is
71274	0	a	The old versions .
71275	0	a	We are probably not supposed to look at this , but
71276	0	a	Yeah , from the previous group .
71277	0	a	They went for for a universal device .
71278	0	a	The touchscreen , yeah .
71279	0	a	Yeah , but also a different device .
71280	0	a	Yeah .
71281	0	a	Then an LCD would be handy .
71282	0	a	Here are the basic functions in here , the selecting dev devices .
71283	0	a	Yeah , and touch screens for all our stuff ,
71284	0	a	yeah .
71285	0	a	I do agree with that .
71286	0	a	Yeah , tu dum .
71287	0	a	English is not so hard by the way .
71288	0	a	No .
71289	0	a	I am breaking a world record here .
71290	0	a	Well , leader ?
71291	0	a	Project Manager ?
71292	0	a	You do ?
71293	1	a	Yeah , you have to make a choice .
71294	0	a	Oh shit .
71295	0	a	We have got a problem , Paul .
71296	0	a	Yes .
71297	0	a	No it is your choice .
71298	0	a	Wow , that is pretty quick .
71299	0	a	Tu dum .
71300	1	a	You have to decide .
71301	1	a	Just pick one .
71302	0	a	It is the lower one .

71318	0	a	Yeah , this one .
71319	0	a	I challenge you .
71320	0	a	No , that does not work .
71321	0	a	No , you gotta use the magic pen .
71322	0	a	What if I put one there ?
71323	0	a	We will see .
71324	0	a	That is stupid .

71335	0	a	It is a difficult choice , either here or there .
71336	0	a	No one wins .
71337	0	a	This is a very interesting design .
71338	0	a	Ugly .

71374	0	a	It is a
71375	0	a	Okay , that makes it easier .
71376	0	a	It is very hard to draw .
71377	0	a	I think I know .
71378	0	a	No , wrong .

71446	0	a	I would like to welcome you to our first meeting .
71447	0	a	I have prepared a little presentation .
71448	0	a	My name is
71449	1	a	and I hope you will introduce yourself in a few minutes ,
71450	1	a	as will I .
71451	0	a	I am the Project Manager of this project ,
71452	0	a	and , well
71453	1	a	I will tell you on what actually is the project .
71454	0	a	This is the agenda for our first meeting .
71455	0	a	this is the opening ,
71456	0	a	then we will get
71457	0	a	I will hope we will get acquainted to each other .
71458	0	a	We will do a little tool training with these two things .
71459	0	a	We will take a look at the project plan .
71460	0	a	there will be time for discussion .
71461	0	a	Actually we have to discuss because we have to create a product .
71462	0	a	And then we will close this session .
71463	1	a	but first of all we I would like to introduce you to this room .
71464	0	a	as you probably have noticed there are little black fields on the table .
71465	0	a	you have to put your laptop exactly in that field so the little cameras can see your face .
71466	0	a	there are cameras everywhere around the room especially here for your face , of course ,
71467	0	a	and this is not a pie ,
71468	0	a	it is a a set of microphones and there are microphones here also .
71469	0	a	But please do not be afraid of them .
71470	0	a	They wo not hurt you .
71471	0	a	Well
71472	0	a	Well
71473	0	a	I am and my function is User Interface Design , I think .
71474	0	a	well
71475	0	a	I said I am the Project Manager
71476	0	a	and I am hoping for a good project
71477	1	a	and I would like to hear who you are and what your functions are on this project .
71478	1	a	Let is start with the ladies .
71479	0	a	So
71480	0	a	that is me .
71481	0	a	Okay ,
71482	0	a	I am I am the Industrial Designer
71483	0	a	and I hope to look forward to a very pleasing end of this project .
71484	0	a	Okay ,
71485	0	a	so I .
71486	0	a	Me too .
71487	0	a	My name is .
71488	0	a	I am Marketing Expert .
71489	0	a	My job is in the company to promote company or promote products to the customers .
71490	0	a	So
71491	0	a	I also h hope we have a pleasant working with with each other .
71492	0	a	Okay , well
71493	0	a	we have some expertise from different pieces of the of the company .
71494	0	a	That is good .
71495	0	a	well
71496	0	a	I said we are working on a project and the aim for the project is to to create a to design a new remote control which has to be original , trendy and of course , user friendly .
71497	0	a	And I hope we have the expertise to create such a project such a product .
71498	0	a	the way we hope to achieve that is the following methods .
71499	0	a	It consists of three phases , namely the functional design , conceptual design and detailed design .
71500	0	a	As you can see , all of these phases consists of two parts , namely individual work part and a meeting where we will discuss our work so far .
71501	0	a	Okay .
71502	1	a	But first I will tell you something about the tools we have here .
71503	0	a	I already talked about the cameras and microphones ,
71504	0	a	but they are not of much use to us .
71505	1	a	we will have to take advantage of these two things .
71506	0	a	They are smart boards .
71507	0	a	As you can see , you can give a presentation on them .
71508	0	a	And this one here is a white board .
71509	1	a	I will instruct you about that soon .
71510	0	a	as you also noticed this presentation document is in our project folder and every document you put in this folder is it is possible to show that here in our meeting room .
71511	0	a	and yeah there are available on both smart boards
71512	0	a	but I think we will mainly use this one for the documents in the shared folder .
71513	0	a	As you can see , this is the same tool bar as is located here .
71514	0	a	the most functions we will use will be to to add a new page , to go back and forward between pages , and of course to save it every now and then .
71515	0	a	and this is the pen with which you can draw on the board , for instance like this if everything is okay , but I first have to put it on the pen ,
71516	0	a	you see I am new to it too .
71517	0	a	and then you can write things like test or whatever you want .
71518	0	a	Oh .
71519	1	a	As you can see you have to move it a little bit slow ,
71520	0	a	it is not such a fast board ,
71521	0	a	it is a smart board but also a slow board .
71522	0	a	but you can write things and of course you can also , when you click here , erase things , so we have est left .
71523	0	a	And you can also delete an entire page ,
71524	1	a	but we ask you not to do that .
71525	1	a	Just simply create a new one and start all over
71526	0	a	because we want to save all the results .
71527	0	a	does everyone understand this nice application ?
71528	0	a	Well
71529	0	a	you can erase it with the eraser ,
71530	1	a	but you should not delete an entire page , but just create a new blank one .
71531	0	a	So we ca not erase anything .
71532	0	a	Yeah .
71533	0	a	Right .
71534	0	a	S
71535	0	a	Good .
71536	1	a	I will delete this one now
71537	0	a	because we do not use it yet .
71538	0	a	Alright .
71539	0	a	But you can of course erase when you make a mistake ,
71540	1	a	but do not delete entire pages .
71541	0	a	And you can also let is see I think it is here change the colour of your pen , for instance take a blue one and change the line width like to five .
71542	0	a	that is what you will need for our first exercise ,
71543	1	a	because I am going to ask you to draw your favourite animal .
71544	0	a	It is also to gets to know each other
71545	1	a	because I am asking three things , for that drawing , to do it on a blank sheet , with different colours
71546	0	a	and I just showed you how to pick a colour ,
71547	1	a	and also with different pen widths
71548	0	a	which I also showed you .
71549	0	a	Okay .
71550	0	a	and a favourite characteristic can be just one word .
71551	0	a	Well
71552	0	a	I am not very good at drawing ,
71553	1	a	but I will go first and try to draw
71554	1	a	Or maybe you should guess what I am drawing , eh .
71555	0	a	No .
71556	0	a	It is a sheep .
71557	0	a	Dinos
71558	0	a	Dinosaur .
71559	0	a	Seal , a seal .
71560	0	a	Beaver .
71561	0	a	A be
71562	0	a	A beaver .
71563	0	a	Well it
71564	0	a	could be everything .
71565	0	a	It is weird .
71566	0	a	With a tail and a mouth .
71567	0	a	Maybe when I put on this thing it could be a turtle , or a snail , But a turtle has .
71568	0	a	It has wings ?
71569	0	a	Well
71570	0	a	the snail does not have legs .
71571	0	a	Turtle .
71572	0	a	Snail .
71573	0	a	Okay .
71574	0	a	And those are slow .
71575	0	a	And I hope our project group will not be slow , but we will work to a good result and do it as fast as we can .
71576	0	a	Okay ,
71577	1	a	time for another animal .
71578	1	a	Would you like to go next ?
71579	0	a	Sure .
71580	0	a	No problem .
71581	0	a	No problem .
71582	0	a	Oh right .
71583	0	a	It was four months ?
71584	0	a	Nice , okay .
71585	0	a	Well .
71586	0	a	The hell .
71587	1	a	To make it a little bit easier .
71588	0	a	It is a giraffe .
71589	1	a	Make that cute .
71590	0	a	Or a dinosaur .
71591	0	a	No , it is a giraffe .
71592	0	a	Kay .
71593	0	a	I think it is easy to r to recognise as a giraffe .
71594	0	a	Yes .
71595	0	a	Giraffe .
71596	0	a	Yeah ,
71597	0	a	the favourite charis characteristic is that the long neck , it can reach everything .
71598	0	a	And I hope I can also reach a lot with this project .
71599	0	a	So
71600	0	a	that is my favourite animal .
71601	0	a	Okay .
71602	0	a	Anything else you need to know ?
71603	0	a	Oh , Tall .
71604	1	a	Could you write the words , underneath it ?
71605	1	a	Or more words .
71606	0	a	Tall .
71607	0	a	So ,
71608	0	a	kay .
71609	1	a	Should I

71625	0	a	It is a rabbit .
71626	0	a	Little rabbits .
71627	0	a	And well
71628	0	a	it is quick , I guess .
71629	0	a	That is my favourite animal .

71638	0	a	I draw I
71639	0	a	I have drawn a dolphin because of its intelligence .
71640	0	a	One of the most intelligent animals in our world .
71641	0	a	Right .
71642	0	a	Well .
71643	0	a	Yeah intelligent .
71644	0	a	With an E .
71645	0	a	I have I have
71646	0	a	Eraser .
71647	1	a	You can try out the eraser now .
71648	0	a	Pen .
71649	0	a	Well not perfect , but okay .
71650	0	a	Okay , well
71651	0	a	thank you very much .
71652	0	a	I can see we have some drawing talent in this group ,
71653	0	a	huh ?
71654	0	a	Well ,
71655	0	a	nice animals , nice words .
71656	0	a	Not really .
71657	0	a	Sounds good .
71658	0	a	back to business , back to the money part .
71659	0	a	from the finance department I have learned that we are aiming for a selling price of twenty five Euros .
71660	0	a	And we are hoping for a aim of fifty million Euros and we are hoping to achieve that by aiming for an international market .
71661	0	a	And the production cost will be twelve Euro fifty max .
71662	0	a	Okay , well
71663	1	a	it is time for some discussion .
71664	0	a	I have wrote down some examples here of what we can can speak about .
71665	0	a	what is your experience with remote controls ,
71666	1	a	what kind of ideas do you have to design a new remote control , maybe for which market segments should we aim , or should we aim for all segments .
71667	0	a	well
71668	1	a	actually I would like to hand the word back to you .
71669	0	a	What is your experience with remote control ?
71670	0	a	A lot of buttons .
71671	0	a	I always lose them .
71672	0	a	Yeah .
71673	0	a	And you always lose them .
71674	0	a	Yes .
71675	0	a	A lot of buttons which you do not use
71676	0	a	or who you do not use
71677	0	a	Complex .
71678	0	a	Yeah .
71679	0	a	Complex .
71680	0	a	Yeah .
71681	0	a	Not user friendly .
71682	0	a	No .
71683	0	a	search for the buttons , which one is which
71684	0	a	and
71685	0	a	Well .
71686	0	a	No .
71687	0	a	Boring .
71688	0	a	Boring , it is not fun to use a remote .
71689	0	a	No .
71690	0	a	Black , all black .
71691	0	a	So ,
71692	0	a	yeah .
71693	0	a	Black colours .
71694	0	a	Well
71695	1	a	maybe we should try to make it fun .
71696	0	a	They use batteries
71697	0	a	and batteries
71698	0	a	and poor signal .
71699	0	a	Yeah .
71700	0	a	The
71701	0	a	the angle you have to use .
71702	0	a	Perhaps that you have a lot of road remotes r road con remote controls .
71703	0	a	You had different remote controls for different devices .
71704	0	a	Yeah ,
71705	0	a	different remote controls ,
71706	0	a	yeah .
71707	0	a	Yes ,
71708	1	a	perhaps you can integrate them or something .
71709	0	a	Yes .
71710	0	a	for the use of different devices .
71711	0	a	Yes .
71712	0	a	Yeah .
71713	0	a	Your stereo and your TV
71714	0	a	and .
71715	0	a	Perhaps that is an idea .
71716	0	a	Yeah
71717	0	a	but then again you you still have a lot of buttons ,
71718	0	a	so
71719	0	a	Flap
71720	0	a	yeah .
71721	0	a	Yeah , that is right .
71722	0	a	Yeah
71723	0	a	but you could I thin
71724	1	a	there is a possibility to g to to put those buttons behind some kind of protection
71725	0	a	so that if y y you only get to see them when you need them .
71726	0	a	And which you do not use .
71727	0	a	Right .
71728	0	a	Yeah , okay , that is possible , but it will get very big the the remote control .
71729	0	a	That is possible ,
71730	0	a	so that you only get the
71731	0	a	No n n no ,
71732	0	a	just
71733	1	a	for example you got th the same size remote control you use everyday , but the usual buttons such as zapping as you call it in Dutch .
71734	0	a	Yeah .
71735	0	a	You should just give it to .
71736	1	a	and the volume control are only the only possible buttons to use directly .
71737	0	a	Changing channel .
71738	0	a	Or the numbers , of course .
71739	0	a	numbers .
71740	1	a	But not the buttons used to search on the the channels on your television .
71741	0	a	On and off .
71742	0	a	You only use those the first time ,
71743	0	a	or .
71744	0	a	Yeah ,
71745	0	a	play , pause , stop .
71746	0	a	So .
71747	0	a	So
71748	0	a	maybe a a minimalist design , the least possible amount of buttons .
71749	0	a	Yeah , I think so , yeah .
71750	0	a	Yes .
71751	1	a	But you should make sure that you have every button they need on it .
71752	0	a	, of course .
71753	0	a	Because things for teletext , I dunno , w
71754	0	a	what is the name ?
71755	0	a	Yeah .
71756	0	a	Yeah , teletext .
71757	0	a	think so .
71758	0	a	Okay .
71759	0	a	So
71760	0	a	you do not want to bother people with loads of buttons , but on the other hand they need many buttons so they do not have to get out of their seat .
71761	0	a	No .
71762	0	a	Yeah .
71763	0	a	But But if if it is if it is international you should look in
71764	0	a	think in Britain they have different things they can do with the TV , or so that you can choose what you want to see .
71765	0	a	Right .
71766	0	a	Because I think a market will be all kind of people .
71767	0	a	Elderly p el elderly , young people , so .
71768	0	a	I dunno if you should take that in consideration , or that you just should aim for the normal TVs
71769	0	a	that And the BBC .
71770	0	a	Yeah I think that is the better one ,
71771	0	a	because
71772	0	a	I think if you you are going to target a lot of people and the whole world and only Britain then I think the cost will rise higher than the twelve fifty , I think .
71773	0	a	Yeah I I understand .
71774	0	a	Yes .
71775	0	a	No .
71776	0	a	Yeah ,
71777	0	a	I do not know if the they have that anywhere else , though .
71778	0	a	I think the aim is better to use the whole world and Britain , yeah .
71779	0	a	Yeah .
71780	0	a	Yeah , we can leave that .
71781	0	a	When I think of it
71782	0	a	I think the main idea of this remote remote control is to make it user friendly .
71783	0	a	Not that much .
71784	0	a	So
71785	0	a	I think when p when the customers will buy this remote control , they already have the remote control which companies with the the standards remote control with which comes with the television .
71786	0	a	Yeah .
71787	0	a	Standard deliver .
71788	0	a	So
71789	1	a	it only has to have the most used buttons .
71790	1	a	You do not have to integrate the buttons to search the channels on your television .
71791	0	a	In those in that
71792	0	a	Yeah
71793	0	a	but I
71794	0	a	but it is impossible to to accommodate accommodate all the buttons on the s on the difference different televisions sets on one remote control .
71795	0	a	No
71796	0	a	but
71797	0	a	Yeah .
71798	0	a	Well
71799	0	a	but
71800	0	a	but then you have to to find your other remote control if you want to search .
71801	0	a	Yeah ,
71802	0	a	th it
71803	0	a	it is
71804	0	a	I think that is not
71805	0	a	Yeah , okay .
71806	0	a	That is not
71807	0	a	Yeah , that is right .
71808	0	a	It is impossible .
71809	0	a	Because for example Sony television has the opportunity to s to make to make it possible for to see on one side of the screen teletext , and on the other side just n regular television .
71810	0	a	No .
71811	0	a	Yeah that is .
71812	0	a	Yeah ,
71813	0	a	but they do not use the same signal , on remote control .
71814	0	a	I think n m n most televisions nowadays do this .
71815	0	a	Well not everywhere .
71816	0	a	So I think numerals .
71817	0	a	Because you ca not use a Panasonic remote control on a on a Philips television .
71818	0	a	Yeah ,
71819	0	a	but then you have to choose the
71820	0	a	always with r universal remotes you have to choose the code .
71821	0	a	Yeah ,
71822	0	a	you can choose the code .
71823	0	a	You can use which which type of television you have .
71824	0	a	Okay .
71825	0	a	Okay .
71826	0	a	That is no problem .
71827	0	a	Okay .
71828	0	a	But I think like the two pages on the same screen , like teletext and normal television , that is that is nowadays standard , I think .
71829	0	a	Okay ,
71830	0	a	but I think that most people th will buy the remote control because because the first they lost the one they lost first one or the first one is broken , so perhaps they have a got a an older television , so that option is not optional for those people .
71831	0	a	Simplicity .
71832	0	a	Yeah .
71833	0	a	Yeah ,
71834	0	a	yeah .
71835	0	a	Yeah .
71836	0	a	Yeah
71837	0	a	g
71838	0	a	available .
71839	0	a	But the people have a new television , and c if you look into the future , then they want will want the button , if their thing is broke .
71840	0	a	True .
71841	0	a	Yeah ,
71842	0	a	yeah .
71843	0	a	Yeah .
71844	0	a	So we should take that in consideration .
71845	0	a	Yeah .
71846	0	a	Okay , well
71847	1	a	any more ideas ?
71848	0	a	No ?
71849	0	a	Okay ,
71850	0	a	yeah
71851	0	a	well
71852	0	a	we have some time .
71853	0	a	Oh ,
71854	0	a	no .
71855	0	a	Of course .
71856	0	a	Guess not .
71857	0	a	Things will come up .
71858	0	a	Yeah .
71859	1	a	Let is see what more I have to tell you .
71860	0	a	I do not think there is much left .
71861	0	a	Nope .
71862	0	a	We are starting to close .
71863	0	a	our next meeting will start well we are a little bit early , but our next meeting will start in in thirty minutes .
71864	0	a	In the meantime there is time for some individual actions .
71865	0	a	, as you can see , the different roles have different tasks .
71866	0	a	And there is a ping .
71867	0	a	Is it my laptop ?
71868	0	a	Yep .
71869	0	a	Yeah .
71870	0	a	Stop the meeting now .
71871	0	a	well
71872	0	a	that is good ,
71873	0	a	five minutes and the meeting is over , right on schedule .
71874	0	a	Yeah
71875	0	a	meeting will close in five minutes .
71876	0	a	Okay .
71877	0	a	the Marketing Expert will will take a look at the user requirement specification .
71878	0	a	The User Interface Designer will work out the technical functions design .
71879	0	a	And this was the Interface Designer ?
71880	0	a	Or the Interaction Designer .
71881	0	a	Or what was it , ID ?
71882	0	a	Interface Designer , okay ,
71883	0	a	first guess was right .
71884	0	a	No interface .
71885	0	a	No ?
71886	0	a	No ,
71887	0	a	the Industrial Designer will take a look at the working design ,
71888	0	a	and the in usability interaction
71889	0	a	Yeah , okay .
71890	0	a	Interface .
71891	0	a	will take a look at the the working design .
71892	0	a	No
71893	0	a	the
71894	0	a	Yeah .
71895	0	a	Industrial Designer , okay ,
71896	0	a	sorry .
71897	0	a	Okay .
71898	1	a	Let is just use the acronyms .
71899	0	a	So
71900	0	a	So
71901	0	a	I should look at what you should be able to do with the remote ,
71902	0	a	or , or how I do not really
71903	0	a	Right .
71904	0	a	and of course specific instructions will be sent to you through your personal coach .
71905	0	a	well those instructions will be in the email you will receive shortly , I hope .
71906	0	a	Alright .
71907	0	a	Me too .
71908	0	a	And of course you have your own expertise .
71909	0	a	Well that was what I had to say .
71910	0	a	Uh huh .
71911	0	a	are there any more questions ?
71912	0	a	No ?
71913	0	a	Okay well
71914	1	a	I think then we have to head back to our offices and start working .
71915	0	a	Okay .
71916	0	a	No .
71917	0	a	No .
71918	1	a	I have one question .
71919	0	a	Okay .
71920	0	a	Okay ,
71921	0	a	one question ?
71922	0	a	Okay
71923	0	a	we are still going .
71924	0	a	Oh .
71925	0	a	Where does it says we have to make a remote ,
71926	0	a	because I presumed
71927	0	a	She did not know who .
71928	0	a	Okay ,
71929	0	a	no ,
71930	0	a	no problem .
71931	0	a	No problem .
71932	0	a	No problem .
71933	0	a	Okay , well
71934	0	a	I expect everything will be much clearer with the instructions we will receive shortly .
71935	0	a	Okay .
71936	0	a	Yeah .
71937	0	a	Alright .
71938	0	a	Okay well
71939	1	a	see you all in about thirty minutes , then .
71940	0	a	Alrighty .
71941	0	a	Yeah .
71942	0	a	Yeah .
71943	0	a	 
71944	0	a	Good morning , again .
71945	0	a	One question .
71946	0	a	Yeah .
71947	0	a	Choose a number ?
71948	0	a	Yes .
71949	0	a	Send .
71950	0	a	Submit .
71951	0	a	Yep
71952	0	a	yep
71953	0	a	yep yep .
71954	0	a	All set ?
71955	0	a	Good .
71956	0	a	Yeah .
71957	0	a	Okay .
71958	0	a	Let is see what we can find here .
71959	0	a	Okay .
71960	0	a	A very warm welcome again to everyone .
71961	0	a	here we are already at our functional design meeting .
71962	0	a	and this is what we are going to do .
71963	0	a	The opening , which we are doing now , and the special note , I am project manager but on the meetings I am also the secretary ,
71964	1	a	which means I will make minutes
71965	0	a	as I did of the previous meeting .
71966	0	a	And I also put these as fast as possible in the project folder , so you can see them and review what we have discussed .
71967	0	a	if I am right , there are three presentations ,
71968	0	a	I guess each one of you has prepared one ?
71969	0	a	Good .
71970	0	a	And we will also take a look at new project requirements , if you have not heard about them yet .
71971	0	a	And then of course we have to take a decision on the remote control functions and we have some more time , forty minutes .
71972	0	a	But I think we will need it .
71973	1	a	well I do not know who wants to go first with his presentation .
71974	1	a	I will go first .
71975	1	a	Okay .
71976	0	a	Yeah .
71977	1	a	I will go first yeah .
71978	0	a	Well .
71979	0	a	You can go first , okay .
71980	0	a	Well ,
71981	1	a	shall I go first with the users ?
71982	0	a	I think
71983	0	a	well
71984	0	a	okay no problem .
71985	0	a	Well
71986	0	a	everybody already has his presentation ,
71987	1	a	so you can adjust it .
71988	0	a	Is there an order ?
71989	0	a	I have not
71990	1	a	And one question ,
71991	0	a	your name Denni , is it with a
71992	0	a	IE EIE , okay .
71993	0	a	Ja precies , ja precies , ja precies
71994	0	a	EIE .
71995	0	a	So .
71996	0	a	Huh ?
71997	0	a	Okay ,
71998	0	a	Okay ,
71999	1	a	I wanted to explain the working design of the remote control .
72000	0	a	Thank you .
72001	0	a	It is possibly very handy if you want to design one of those .
72002	0	a	well so
72003	0	a	it basically works as I r wrote down in this little summary .
72004	0	a	when you press a button , that is when you do pr for example when you want to turn up the volume , a little connection is made the the rubber button just presses on a on a little print plate which makes a connection that gives the chips , which is mounted beneath those that plastic of a rubber button .
72005	0	a	Sorry .
72006	0	a	senses that a connection has been made ,
72007	0	a	and know
72008	0	a	and knows what button you pressed , becau for example the the volume up or volume down button .
72009	0	a	the the chip makes a Morse code like signal which then is si signalled to several transistors
72010	0	a	which makes
72011	0	a	which sends the signal to a little let .
72012	0	a	You know what a let is ?
72013	0	a	Okay .
72014	0	a	Yeah .
72015	0	a	And that makes the the infra red lights signal which is sent to the television set .
72016	0	a	which has a sensor in it to sense the signal of the infra red .
72017	0	a	That is basically how it works .
72018	0	a	the findings that I found searching up some detailed information about the remote controls , are that they are very easy to produce ,
72019	0	a	it is pis
72020	0	a	it is possible to make them in mass production because it is as eas
72021	0	a	it is as easy as printing a page ,
72022	0	a	just fibreglass plate is b is covered with some coatings and and chips .
72023	0	a	and the technology is already available , we do not have to find out how remote controls have to work or how that how to make some chips that are possible to to to transmit those signals .
72024	0	a	I made a little animation of about how a tran our remote controller works .
72025	0	a	Oh right .
72026	0	a	Animation .
72027	0	a	we tel
72028	0	a	There .
72029	0	a	There is something turning .
72030	0	a	Yeah ,
72031	0	a	it is a little bug it is in the in the smart board .
72032	0	a	Okay .
72033	0	a	well
72034	0	a	the sub component , I suppose that you understand what a sub component is , is f in this example it is the button .
72035	0	a	when it is pressed down , , the switch is ter is is switched on , so with the wire is sent to the to the chip in co operation with the battery of course , because to make a a signal possible you have to have some sort of li
72036	0	a	a d ad electronic
72037	0	a	Yes ,
72038	0	a	, okay .
72039	0	a	Infrared light .
72040	0	a	w
72041	0	a	after it is being composed by the chip the signal is transported to the infra red bulb , and from there it signals a Morse code like signal to the to the b to the bulb in in the television set .
72042	0	a	Okay .
72043	0	a	S
72044	0	a	I wrote down some personal preferences about the remote control .
72045	0	a	Of course it is very handy if the remote control is hand held ,
72046	0	a	so you do not have to wind it up or something , or just is it is it is very light to to make to use it .
72047	1	a	I personally pref prefer that it would be p come available in the various colours , and easy to use buttons .
72048	0	a	But I suppose that the one of the other team members thought of that too .
72049	0	a	Yeah ,
72050	0	a	I have got it there too .
72051	0	a	And it is possible for several designs and easy to use b sorry , easy to use buttons .
72052	1	a	Perhaps soft touch , touch screen buttons
72053	0	a	because the rubber buttons are always they slightly they can be slightly damaged , so the numbers on the buttons are not possible to read anymore .
72054	1	a	And well as I said before th we can make several designs .
72055	0	a	Yeah .
72056	0	a	Okay , well ,
72057	0	a	that is my contribution to this meeting ,
72058	0	a	and two of these this meeting .
72059	0	a	To this meeting .
72060	0	a	Okay ,
72061	0	a	thank you .
72062	1	a	Shall I go next ?
72063	0	a	Kay .
72064	0	a	Yep .
72065	0	a	So .
72066	0	a	Please .
72067	0	a	So .
72068	0	a	Smoking .
72069	0	a	Well ,
72070	0	a	my name is , and I looked at technical functions design of the remote .
72071	0	a	I did this by looking at examples of other remote controls , of how they they look , and information from the web that I found .
72072	0	a	well what I found was that th the actual use of the remote control is to send messages to television set ,
72073	0	a	how you d
72074	0	a	what you described just early .
72075	0	a	And this can be all sorts of medsa messages , turn it on , turn it off , change the channel , adjust volume , that kind of thing .
72076	0	a	play video , teletext , but also t play CD if you use it your CD player the remote control will that one .
72077	0	a	There are some examples of remote controls .
72078	0	a	You can see they are very different .
72079	0	a	The one has got all the functions that you could possibly need and an lot of buttons etcetera .
72080	0	a	And the other is more user friendly , little with big buttons .
72081	0	a	And not n all the the the the stuff you can do with it , but the the essential stuff is there .
72082	1	a	I guess you could better y you should look at a a user centred approach ,
72083	0	a	because the customers have to use them
72084	0	a	and
72085	0	a	and if they do not think it is usable they wo not buy it .
72086	0	a	A lot of buttons they may think from I do not need s as much as that .
72087	0	a	, well
72088	0	a	perf
72089	1	a	personal preferences is is a simple remote , with the basic functions that you can need that you could use .
72090	1	a	But keep in mind the new functions of TV what we discussed earlier ,
72091	0	a	split screen and is that a function that you should have ?
72092	0	a	Because all the TVs will have them .
72093	0	a	Or because of only a few and is not really necessary .
72094	1	a	And then make it I would make so that you can could use it on more than one appliance .
72095	0	a	If you have one that does with the vi the the video , it could also work with with the stereo , because play is play and stop stop and that sort of thing .
72096	0	a	The shu c
72097	1	a	you could reuse the buttons
72098	0	a	so that you do not have to have a lot of buttons for anything .
72099	1	a	And it should be a user friendly , clear buttons , and not too much .
72100	0	a	And that is my presentation .
72101	0	a	Okay ,
72102	0	a	thank you .
72103	0	a	Okay .
72104	0	a	Kay .
72105	0	a	Check .
72106	1	a	You must still have it open .
72107	0	a	Kijke
72108	0	a	Kay , so .
72109	0	a	We are going to j discuss the functional requirements of the remote ,
72110	0	a	that m
72111	0	a	that means that functions user n want to have on the remote control ,
72112	0	a	or just
72113	0	a	Yeah , and the users , actually .
72114	0	a	The methods I I prefer is we are going to look which section of the users we are going to focus a l on more .
72115	0	a	Are the younger people going to buy the remote control or the elderly people ?
72116	1	a	And then tho that section we are going to focus and adjust the remote more to that section than the whole user section .
72117	0	a	Okay .
72118	0	a	Some data .
72119	0	a	Younger people , from sixteen to thir forty five years are more interested in fj features like LCD screens , speech recognition e etcetera .
72120	0	a	And we possess about two third of the market from in that range of age .
72121	0	a	The elderly people , from forty five years to sixty five years are not that much interested in features , and we possess less than two third , that is two fifth , of the market share in that area .
72122	0	a	Goed so .
72123	0	a	Kay .
72124	0	a	Findings .
72125	0	a	Fifty percent of the users lose their remote often .
72126	1	a	So we do not have to make it very small , like like a mobile phone or something , but
72127	1	a	some somewhat bi bigger than small ,
72128	0	a	so you do not lose it that much anymore .
72129	0	a	Yeah .
72130	0	a	Seventy five percent of the users also find it ugly , and fif seventy five of the users zap a lot ,
72131	1	a	so the buttons sh should be that small , or should not be that complex
72132	0	a	because we have to search for the buttons , which one are you going to use .
72133	0	a	Next .
72134	0	a	Important issues about the remote .
72135	0	a	I think it would be better with a personal reference , but okay .
72136	1	a	Remote control has to have to have a low power usage ,
72137	0	a	because s w seventy five percent of the users only zap one time an hour , so the power usage is also one one time an hour , or so , with a high power usage we would use a lot of but batteries .
72138	0	a	The volume button and the channel buttons are the two most important buttons on the remote control ,
72139	1	a	so those they those have to h be find very easily .
72140	1	a	And have to be somewhat like bigger etcetera .
72141	1	a	It has also be have to find easily when the label is gone .
72142	0	a	My colleague also announced it that labels should be scratched off
72143	0	a	or would be s senden
72144	0	a	okay .
72145	0	a	So
72146	1	a	if that is k if that is the problem , you also have to find it easily on the remote .
72147	1	a	Buttons .
72148	1	a	Like what all colleagues said , have to have to be minimalized .
72149	1	a	or should be covered , or in LCD screen .
72150	0	a	LCD screen is easy
72151	0	a	because we have the LCD screen , we have the various options .
72152	0	a	Put one option
72153	0	a	and then you have the all the buttons of that options , so the other options would be gone .
72154	0	a	And you do not see the buttons .
72155	0	a	So LCD screens should be easy , but an LCD screen , the problem with the L sc LCD screen is that elderly people fr from forty five to for sixty five years do not use the LCD screen a lot .
72156	1	a	So we have to that keep that in mind that if you are going to implement LCD screen , you do not have to make it that hard to learn or to use .
72157	0	a	LCD screen as in touch screen ?
72158	0	a	Okay .
72159	0	a	Yeah , touch screen , yeah .
72160	0	a	The last but not least , younger people are more critical about the features .
72161	0	a	Because they use the remote control often more often , and are more technical than the ol older people .
72162	0	a	And the older people spend more money , and easily on a remote control .
72163	0	a	Kay .
72164	1	a	So we have to keep in mind to to focus not a lot not that much on the younger pep younger people , but also somewhat on the elderly people .
72165	0	a	And on my personal preferences , I do not have any mo more time to come with that ,
72166	0	a	but like I said , LCD screen is easily to use
72167	0	a	because you have you can implement a lot of buttons in one remote with not that much buttons .
72168	1	a	And it should be easy to use .
72169	1	a	Especially the volume buttons , the channel buttes buttons and the number buttons to zap through the channels .
72170	0	a	And that is it .
72171	0	a	Okay .
72172	0	a	Okay ,
72173	0	a	thank you .
72174	0	a	Oh right .
72175	0	a	, well
72176	0	a	thank you all , huh .
72177	0	a	I dunno did everyone receive an email with the new project requirements ?
72178	0	a	No ?
72179	0	a	Well ,
72180	0	a	then I think it is a good thing that I made a separate slide of them
72181	0	a	so you can all read them .
72182	0	a	No .
72183	0	a	Res I did not .
72184	0	a	No .
72185	0	a	Perhaps the rest ?
72186	0	a	Oh .
72187	0	a	Ja , Be
72188	0	a	television .
72189	0	a	Oh , well not in this presentation .
72190	0	a	Should be in there .
72191	0	a	Well ,
72192	1	a	I can tell you them from my laptop .
72193	0	a	teletext does has become outdated since the popularity of the internet .
72194	0	a	So that is the first thing we I think we should pay less attention to teletext .
72195	0	a	the remote control should only be used for the television ,
72196	0	a	otherwise the project becomes more complex ,
72197	0	a	which endangers the time to market ,
72198	0	a	and of course would make it more costly , I think .
72199	0	a	our current customers are within the age group of forty plus , and new product should reach a new market with customers that are younger than forty , and you talked about that before .
72200	0	a	And a last point , but also very important , our corporate image should stay recognisable in our products , which means that our corporate colour and slogan must be implemented in the new design .
72201	1	a	So we have to keep that in mind .
72202	0	a	well
72203	1	a	according to our agenda it is then time to take a decision on the remote control functions .
72204	0	a	So ,
72205	1	a	who has any idea about what should be on it , and what should not ?
72206	0	a	Yeah .
72207	0	a	Well
72208	0	a	you said it should only work with one appliance ?
72209	0	a	Or with one d che only the TV ?
72210	0	a	And the video also , or not ?
72211	0	a	Oh .
72212	0	a	Yeah .
72213	0	a	Only be used for television .
72214	0	a	Only the television .
72215	0	a	Well
72216	0	a	it says only for television here , huh .
72217	0	a	Alright .
72218	0	a	Okay .
72219	0	a	Makes it a lot easier ,
72220	0	a	huh ?
72221	0	a	Yeah .
72222	0	a	So
72223	0	a	yeah , then you can
72224	0	a	yeah .
72225	1	a	Requirements ,
72226	0	a	no ?
72227	1	a	Functions .
72228	1	a	Then it should have on , off ,
72229	0	a	and
72230	0	a	Yeah .
72231	0	a	Yeah
72232	0	a	for Standby options ,
72233	0	a	yeah ?
72234	0	a	yeah .
72235	0	a	Yeah ,
72236	1	a	the basics then by a volume , channel , one till two zero numbers on it ,
72237	0	a	oh teletext does not have to be ?
72238	1	a	other functions .
72239	0	a	And per perhaps
72240	0	a	No .
72241	0	a	Well
72242	0	a	yes yes s sh
72243	1	a	A button where you can change from one number to two numbers .
72244	0	a	Yeah
72245	0	a	I had
72246	0	a	Yeah ,
72247	0	a	yeah .
72248	0	a	Two s two
72249	0	a	two digits ,
72250	0	a	oh okay .
72251	0	a	Can you
72252	0	a	Do not know if that is got a name ,
72253	0	a	but
72254	0	a	Yeah .
72255	0	a	Yeah
72256	0	a	I understand what you mean .
72257	0	a	I think it is
72258	0	a	I think it is easy to implement a button with a s s what which especially do that ,
72259	0	a	because some TVs , if you press the t one and then the two , it be between five secs it make twelve ,
72260	0	a	and that is that is not relaxed to user .
72261	0	a	Yeah .
72262	0	a	It makes it twelve , yeah .
72263	0	a	Indeed .
72264	0	a	S
72265	0	a	Yeah .
72266	0	a	Okay .
72267	0	a	Well ,
72268	0	a	not really
72269	0	a	And
72270	0	a	and there are some models that do not accommodate that function .
72271	0	a	So
72272	0	a	d wh
72273	0	a	the Philip is television makes it possible in that indeed to press one and then two to make the tj to reach channel twelve .
72274	0	a	Yeah .
72275	0	a	So that it easy and fast .
72276	0	a	But all the television makes use of those button where you first press that button and then press two digits to to get
72277	0	a	yeah , think so .
72278	0	a	Yeah .
72279	0	a	Yeah .
72280	0	a	Yeah ,
72281	1	a	so you should have that one on .
72282	0	a	Our main targets' age are ? were ?
72283	0	a	Forty five plus , or ?
72284	0	a	Forties , okay
72285	0	a	because because younger people as
72286	0	a	younger people have now , sixteen till to twenty five age , are f eighty one percent interested in LCD screen .
72287	1	a	Mute misschien also .
72288	0	a	well
72289	0	a	new product should reach a market with customers that are younger than forty , and now we have current customers of forty plus .
72290	0	a	From twenty six to thirty five have sixty six percent , and thirty six to forty five , fifty five percent ,
72291	0	a	so I think to
72292	0	a	Because on most recog remote controls the print plate will be broken how much , two years .
72293	0	a	You have to press h very hard to go to the next channel .
72294	0	a	With the LCD screen it is easier
72295	0	a	because you only have to wipe the screen to for fingerprint , and then you can use it again .
72296	0	a	Yeah ,
72297	0	a	we
72298	0	a	we could
72299	0	a	yeah .
72300	0	a	But I think that that collides with our mission to make it very cheap .
72301	0	a	Because LCD screens are very expensive .
72302	0	a	Yeah , okay .
72303	0	a	Yeah
72304	0	a	but a
72305	0	a	you do not know
72306	0	a	True .
72307	0	a	A touch screen probably even more .
72308	0	a	An
72309	0	a	But ,
72310	0	a	do you
72311	0	a	But if you would do an LCD screen do we have don do not you have any buttons ?
72312	0	a	Or because if it only directs at the TV , then you only have I do not know what you want to do with the LCD screen .
72313	0	a	So ,
72314	0	a	true , true .
72315	0	a	But
72316	0	a	Well
72317	0	a	is it possible to make an LCD screen , how was the information ?
72318	0	a	So
72319	1	a	perhaps we should we should focus on that LCD screen .
72320	0	a	Yeah ,
72321	0	a	it only says that this perce percentage like LCD screen .
72322	0	a	Because , yeah
72323	0	a	and it says that younger age between sixteen and forty five highly interesting features more critical .
72324	0	a	And if the only f
72325	0	a	Yeah ,
72326	0	a	because our target is sixteen to forty five .
72327	0	a	Yeah
72328	0	a	but will we not exceed our our production
72329	0	a	Is it possible to find out , anyway ?
72330	0	a	You know ?
72331	0	a	No ,
72332	0	a	an LCD screen is just like like a drawn here .
72333	0	a	Yeah
72334	0	a	you do not know how much it costs .
72335	0	a	Yeah ,
72336	0	a	you do not know how much it costs , the LCD screen .
72337	0	a	No , I do not have any costs here , I only have percentages .
72338	0	a	Yeah .
72339	0	a	just displays several buttons , for example if you wanted the minimal use b buttons , such as channel and volume , you just h displays four buttons on the screen and it is possible to p press them down , just like a touch screen .
72340	0	a	Yeah ?
72341	0	a	Oh right ,
72342	0	a	so you can
72343	0	a	Oh , yeah alright .
72344	0	a	So
72345	0	a	you can adjust which buttons you want on that
72346	0	a	s screen .
72347	0	a	Yeah , if you want to adjust , like for example , adjust the audio settings , you press audio on the touchscreen
72348	0	a	and you get the buttons for audio settings , so the other buttons are gone .
72349	0	a	Yeah , we can make it possible to do that , yeah .
72350	0	a	Yeah yeah .
72351	0	a	Yeah alright , oh right .
72352	0	a	Yeah .
72353	0	a	Yeah ,
72354	0	a	yeah .
72355	0	a	So
72356	0	a	we are going for an LCD screen ?
72357	0	a	And hoping that when we produce a lot it wo not be too expensive .
72358	0	a	Yeah .
72359	0	a	I think it is the most easier thing ,
72360	0	a	yeah .
72361	0	a	Would be yeah .
72362	0	a	That is my
72363	0	a	Yeah .
72364	0	a	No .
72365	0	a	Well
72366	0	a	Yeah .
72367	0	a	Twelve fifty .
72368	0	a	we had twelve fifty ,
72369	0	a	I guess , for production ?
72370	0	a	Any guesses ?
72371	0	a	Yeah .
72372	0	a	Well
72373	0	a	I suppose wi if the mar if our if the i
72374	1	a	if the young people are interested in LCD screens , we should make them .
72375	0	a	Highly .
72376	0	a	And if that is our d market share to and our goal to deliver those remote controls
72377	0	a	Yeah .
72378	0	a	But
72379	0	a	But he also said that we should not only focus on the younger people , but also on the older ,
72380	0	a	and will they use it if it only has an LCD screen ?
72381	0	a	Oh ,
72382	0	a	so still a little bit people
72383	0	a	Yeah that is right .
72384	0	a	Yeah ,
72385	0	a	but
72386	0	a	s
72387	0	a	forty six to forty five , thirty three percent , and sixty fifty six to sixty five twelve percent .
72388	0	a	But our our our what is it , project requirements are the new products should be reached for new markets , to customers that are younger than forty .
72389	1	a	But you do not want to alienate the other
72390	0	a	But if they also buy it then it is alright .
72391	0	a	No , that not now ,
72392	0	a	but , so
72393	0	a	Yeah ,
72394	0	a	but market share fro for for forty years and younger is higher than that of sixty five and younger .
72395	0	a	I guess .
72396	0	a	Yeah .
72397	0	a	Yeah .
72398	0	a	Alright .
72399	0	a	Okay , so
72400	0	a	LCD it is ?
72401	0	a	Okay .
72402	0	a	An
72403	0	a	Yes .
72404	0	a	It is treasure .
72405	1	a	And what else ?
72406	0	a	Yeah , okay .
72407	0	a	I hope we h and
72408	0	a	let is hope to reach those those sales .
72409	0	a	Yeah ,
72410	0	a	i i if it
72411	0	a	Yeah ,
72412	1	a	if it costs gets too much , too expensive , then yeah , we should be sticking to rubber buttons .
72413	0	a	Yeah .
72414	0	a	Yeah ,
72415	0	a	can you s
72416	0	a	I think that that they will send you some information about the cost of LCD screens .
72417	0	a	N
72418	0	a	nothing , no costs at all .
72419	0	a	Yeah .
72420	0	a	so if you
72421	0	a	Yeah , so
72422	1	a	if you you receive an email about that , can you post it in the
72423	0	a	or should not we post that in our projects mail folder .
72424	0	a	But perhaps later ,
72425	0	a	so
72426	0	a	Yeah .
72427	0	a	Yeah ,
72428	0	a	in I think that should
72429	0	a	yeah
72430	0	a	I think we all get the costs of everything .
72431	0	a	I do not
72432	0	a	Well
72433	1	a	perhaps we should have a backup plan that we would use buttons if it is too expensive .
72434	0	a	Because you are the the Marketing Expert .
72435	0	a	Yeah , okay , I will I will post it .
72436	0	a	I
72437	0	a	Yeah sure , sure .
72438	0	a	Yeah .
72439	0	a	But for now it is LCD .
72440	0	a	Okay , LCD
72441	0	a	, yeah .
72442	0	a	Yeah .
72443	0	a	Okay .
72444	0	a	Then you have the seventy five percent of users find it r ugly .
72445	0	a	The LCD ?
72446	0	a	Oh that is a bit of a problem .
72447	0	a	Yeah , and eighty percent of the users would spend more money with a when a remote would look fancy .
72448	0	a	Oh , that is a bit of a problem .
72449	0	a	Tha i
72450	0	a	l
72451	0	a	i
72452	0	a	it will look fancy with LCD screen .
72453	0	a	It is looks fancy one
72454	0	a	yeah , of LCD screen .
72455	0	a	Yeah ,
72456	0	a	but they do not they do not like it .
72457	0	a	Yeah .
72458	0	a	Yeah .
72459	0	a	They think it is ugly .
72460	0	a	When it has an LCD screen .
72461	0	a	Yeah ,
72462	0	a	just a the plain remotes , not not specific LCD remotes .
72463	0	a	Oh , alright ,
72464	0	a	I thought that you said that .
72465	0	a	So
72466	0	a	Yeah ,
72467	1	a	and maybe you can make something fancy out of an LCD remote ,
72468	0	a	because it is new , as far as I know .
72469	0	a	Yeah .
72470	0	a	Yeah , of course .
72471	0	a	yeah .
72472	0	a	And then you have the other thing , that seventy five percent zap a lot , but that is not a f question with the LCD screen .
72473	0	a	And then not yeah .
72474	0	a	Only thing you have to do is wipe the screen off once each time , to get all the fingerprints off it .
72475	0	a	Yeah .
72476	0	a	Yeah .
72477	0	a	Okay ?
72478	0	a	Yeah .
72479	0	a	Okay ,
72480	1	a	what else does our remote need ?
72481	0	a	Mute button .
72482	1	a	A mute button .
72483	0	a	I think .
72484	0	a	The most important things on a f on an on an remote control are channel selection , volume con selection , and power s power usage .
72485	0	a	And
72486	0	a	Yeah .
72487	0	a	And a teletext , but that is not of the question .
72488	0	a	But
72489	0	a	But should not you put a button of for teletext on the for the people who want to use it ?
72490	0	a	Remembering we have got a big remote that you have to fill .
72491	0	a	Other things are
72492	0	a	Sorry ?
72493	0	a	Yeah , it could be .
72494	0	a	Yeah .
72495	0	a	Yeah ,
72496	1	a	and we could make an a a separate menu on the LCD screen for teletext .
72497	0	a	Yeah , teletext .
72498	0	a	Yeah .
72499	0	a	Yeah .
72500	0	a	And there is also a A sh
72501	1	a	but in a sub sub menu or something like that .
72502	0	a	And other other less important things are screen settings , audio settings , and channel settings , Less important .
72503	0	a	Yeah ,
72504	0	a	they are less important ,
72505	1	a	but I think they should be there ,
72506	0	a	or not ?
72507	0	a	Like with a with a mouse , you have not , yeah .
72508	0	a	Yeah , should be there ,
72509	0	a	but not press
72510	0	a	Yeah , sub menu , yeah .
72511	1	a	I think it is also important to make it possible to how do you call it in English , , to not use batteries ,
72512	0	a	and use ac bat batteries to to be
72513	0	a	yeah
72514	0	a	yeah sure .
72515	0	a	Indeed .
72516	0	a	So you can mount the the the the remote control to to refill the
72517	0	a	Yeah .
72518	0	a	Yeah ,
72519	0	a	in a breath it is Charted .
72520	1	a	We should think of the twelve fifty we have
72521	0	a	but I do not know how much that is going to
72522	0	a	Yeah .
72523	0	a	Yeah ,
72524	0	a	but we do not we do not have any costs now ,
72525	0	a	so Yeah .
72526	0	a	Okay ,
72527	0	a	because i when you get an LCD screen , you run it on batteries , the batteries will be empty very soon , very fast .
72528	0	a	Yeah
72529	0	a	e e
72530	0	a	power supply is one of the most important things .
72531	0	a	You should
72532	1	a	Perhaps you should be able to to switch the control off .
72533	0	a	Yeah .
72534	0	a	If you have an LCD screen that is burns all the time I dunno .
72535	0	a	Yeah ,
72536	0	a	yeah .
72537	0	a	Yeah .
72538	0	a	You should not on and off
72539	0	a	because that is ver extra , that you have t first
72540	0	a	you have to turn the remote on ,
72541	0	a	and then you can
72542	0	a	I do not know .
72543	1	a	And go to standby mode when you do not use it ,
72544	0	a	so that
72545	0	a	Yeah , automatically .
72546	0	a	Yeah ,
72547	0	a	I think it is it is not that easy
72548	0	a	because I do not think people will like it who who that you have to turn it on first and then use it ,
72549	1	a	so I think it is better when th the TV shuts down , the remote shuts down .
72550	0	a	Nee that is that is
72551	0	a	yeah .
72552	0	a	But then you ca not
72553	0	a	Yeah .
72554	0	a	Yeah .
72555	0	a	Yeah yeah
72556	0	a	au
72557	0	a	automac matically ,
72558	0	a	that it
72559	0	a	yeah .
72560	0	a	Yeah .
72561	1	a	After two minutes or three minutes , something like that .
72562	1	a	After two minutes ,
72563	0	a	yeah two three minutes ,
72564	0	a	yeah .
72565	0	a	Yeah .
72566	0	a	Yeah .
72567	1	a	And maybe a low battery indicator ?
72568	1	a	On the screen .
72569	0	a	Yeah .
72570	0	a	Sure .
72571	0	a	Yeah .
72572	0	a	And then b that
72573	1	a	before an hour when its get again gets empty .
72574	0	a	Yeah .
72575	0	a	Then you have plenty of time to recharge it , of put it in a recharger .
72576	0	a	Charger .
72577	0	a	So we are going for the for the recharger .
72578	0	a	Yeah .
72579	0	a	Yeah ,
72580	0	a	if it is .
72581	0	a	Okay .
72582	0	a	If it is sensible .
72583	0	a	Yeah ,
72584	0	a	because when you are watching TV , you are zapping and you have to put it in a recharger ,
72585	0	a	and I do not think it
72586	0	a	Yeah ,
72587	0	a	okay ,
72588	1	a	but then we have to be sure that the the the the batteries go hours , six hours , five , six hours , then .
72589	0	a	Yeah .
72590	0	a	Yeah ,
72591	0	a	b when the batteries are low
72592	0	a	But you will also forget to put it in , because you throw it on the couch and you do not remember .
72593	0	a	No ,
72594	0	a	when you
72595	0	a	when you are done with s w watching your television , you have to put it
72596	0	a	Yeah sure , of course .
72597	0	a	Yeah , then you have a problem .
72598	0	a	Yeah ,
72599	0	a	but
72600	0	a	But you also forget to buy batteries , and then you can you ca not use it ,
72601	0	a	so I
72602	0	a	Yeah .
72603	0	a	Yeah .
72604	0	a	That is right .
72605	0	a	Yeah .
72606	1	a	Or we have to be sure that the batteries last couple of days when they are recharged .
72607	0	a	So .
72608	0	a	Well
72609	1	a	I think the batteries should should w should work a lot longer than a couple of days ,
72610	0	a	or not ?
72611	0	a	Cause
72612	0	a	Yeah , that is right ,
72613	0	a	but
72614	0	a	Yeah .
72615	0	a	Yeah
72616	0	a	because you have b
72617	0	a	but you have LCD screen .
72618	0	a	High power usage .
72619	0	a	High power user cell , i
72620	1	a	it should be a standard move to to put your remote control in the charger when you are done watching television ,
72621	0	a	that is also a a a great advantage
72622	0	a	because you ca not lose it anymore .
72623	0	a	Yes .
72624	0	a	Because you are obliged to put it in the charger and not to leave it in a couch between some cushions .
72625	0	a	True .
72626	0	a	Yeah .
72627	0	a	Yeah .
72628	0	a	True .
72629	0	a	Right .
72630	0	a	Yeah ,
72631	0	a	you made a point there .
72632	0	a	Okay .
72633	1	a	But then you also have to s have somewhere where you can put a remo recharger near your couch
72634	0	a	because otherwise you have to walk a long way when you twoft want to turn on the TV .
72635	0	a	Yeah ,
72636	0	a	also .
72637	0	a	Yeah ,
72638	0	a	otherwise all your yeah .
72639	1	a	Just a small device .
72640	0	a	Yeah .
72641	0	a	Yeah
72642	0	a	it has not
72643	1	a	It does not have to be big .
72644	1	a	Plug it in , that is it .
72645	0	a	I think everything has it for
72646	0	a	and I guess .
72647	0	a	Yeah ,
72648	1	a	like a like telephone charger or something .
72649	0	a	Yeah
72650	0	a	just
72651	1	a	just a cable , or a even a a a a a charger where you can mount it on .
72652	0	a	Yeah .
72653	0	a	Yeah .
72654	1	a	Something like that ,
72655	0	a	just u
72656	0	a	Okay .
72657	0	a	Yeah .
72658	0	a	Alright .
72659	0	a	Okay , well
72660	0	a	I have
72661	0	a	Yeah ,
72662	0	a	you have some more points .
72663	0	a	It has to be easy to use also , or things .
72664	0	a	market share , speaker re speech recognition .
72665	0	a	I think .
72666	1	a	Functional designs for the elderly you could make it possible to enlarge the screen , so make it possible to not display a button at ten points
72667	0	a	, or
72668	0	a	Yeah
72669	0	a	but it is one of the functions you have to specify .
72670	0	a	Also .
72671	0	a	Well
72672	1	a	I think that this should be standard .
72673	1	a	Large button large buttons .
72674	0	a	Yeah ?
72675	0	a	Okay .
72676	0	a	Because we can look at perhaps forty buttons at a screen , but the elderly only look at two buttons .
72677	0	a	Okay .
72678	0	a	And you said something about speech recognition ?
72679	0	a	Even bigger than for LCD .
72680	0	a	Yeah ,
72681	0	a	it says also
72682	0	a	Yeah .
72683	0	a	Speech recognition ?
72684	0	a	Hello .
72685	0	a	Twelve Euro
72686	0	a	twelve Euro fifty .
72687	0	a	Yeah ,
72688	0	a	twelve fifty , twelve fifty .
72689	0	a	Twelve .
72690	0	a	That is an
72691	0	a	also ninety one percent sixteen to twenty five , twenty six to thirty five years , seventy six percent , and thirty six to forty five , thirty five percent .
72692	0	a	So it is pretty big .
72693	0	a	Well ,
72694	1	a	spread it by a big market .
72695	0	a	But then I I
72696	0	a	I
72697	0	a	Yeah .
72698	0	a	Yeah .
72699	0	a	W
72700	0	a	I know let is do a speech .
72701	0	a	Well
72702	0	a	let is leave out all the remote controls and just put a microphone on top of the television to
72703	0	a	Yeah
72704	0	a	Yeah .
72705	0	a	Yeah .
72706	0	a	Yeah .
72707	0	a	Yeah .
72708	0	a	Ninety .
72709	0	a	Twenty five .
72710	1	a	You can clap or something .
72711	0	a	channel .
72712	0	a	Turn volume up .
72713	0	a	Yeah .
72714	0	a	Hey ,
72715	0	a	that
72716	0	a	that is an idea .
72717	1	a	Now you should not say the wrong thing , I dunno .
72718	0	a	Yeah .
72719	0	a	Okay , well
72720	0	a	that should
72721	1	a	it has to be remote control ,
72722	0	a	not
72723	0	a	Yeah .
72724	0	a	Yeah ,
72725	0	a	twelve .
72726	0	a	But they want to talk into the remo remote control , or something ,
72727	0	a	or ?
72728	0	a	Oh ,
72729	0	a	but do we want to implement that ,
72730	0	a	or ?
72731	0	a	Yeah .
72732	0	a	Yeah .
72733	0	a	Sure why not why not
72734	0	a	Yeah , .
72735	0	a	Is this only would you
72736	0	a	would you pay more for speech recognition in a remote control .
72737	0	a	It is the only thing it says .
72738	1	a	I think an LCD screen should be suf sufficient .
72739	0	a	Yeah .
72740	0	a	But when you look at the percentages Speech recognition scores even higher , huh ?
72741	0	a	Yeah , well ,
72742	0	a	maybe because of the cost , but nobody knows how much it will cost .
72743	0	a	Yeah ,
72744	0	a	it says a lot ,
72745	0	a	but
72746	0	a	No
72747	0	a	I think I think it is better to have L LCD screen ,
72748	0	a	because in the area of tw thirty six to forty five , we have about thirty percent of the market share in in our hands , and fifty five of those people want LCD screen and thirty five want speech recognition .
72749	0	a	Perhaps the options should be
72750	0	a	Why not ?
72751	0	a	Why not ?
72752	0	a	Let is hope to have some d
72753	0	a	We should do it .
72754	0	a	I know
72755	0	a	So I think it is better to keep it with LCD screen .
72756	0	a	But would it be useful to imple implement both ?
72757	0	a	On one remote ?
72758	0	a	Or
72759	0	a	Yeah , I dunno .
72760	0	a	Yeah , if the costs al allow it .
72761	0	a	Well
72762	0	a	I do not know if that can be done with the cost of twelve fifty .
72763	0	a	Nee .
72764	0	a	With that
72765	0	a	Yeah ,
72766	1	a	but how would you like to implement that ,
72767	0	a	that you say volume up , and then it goes up ,
72768	0	a	or ?
72769	0	a	If it should be done ,
72770	0	a	if it could be done , I wo not matter .
72771	0	a	Yeah .
72772	0	a	Yeah .
72773	0	a	Sure .
72774	0	a	Yeah .
72775	0	a	Yeah .
72776	0	a	Certain systems already exist , I think .
72777	0	a	Then you also have to have different languages if we go international .
72778	0	a	Then it is y it is yours to do a French and Dutch and English
72779	0	a	Yeah , that is right .
72780	0	a	True .
72781	0	a	True , yeah .
72782	0	a	Yeah .
72783	0	a	True .
72784	0	a	Yeah .
72785	0	a	But that should also be with f should be also with LCD screen .
72786	1	a	This should be accommodated with some software ,
72787	0	a	Yeah .
72788	0	a	Because then I think in Chinese is different written , volume is different written than Swahili or something .
72789	0	a	Yeah .
72790	0	a	Right .
72791	0	a	Swahili .
72792	0	a	Yeah
72793	1	a	you can use icons
72794	0	a	for the a speaker and
72795	0	a	But if that is better than language for the for the remote .
72796	0	a	Swahili .
72797	0	a	Yeah .
72798	0	a	Ja , well possible .
72799	0	a	Indeed .
72800	0	a	Yeah ,
72801	0	a	yeah
72802	0	a	yeah yeah
72803	0	a	Yeah .
72804	0	a	So we want to
72805	0	a	yeah
72806	0	a	it is international
72807	0	a	okay .
72808	0	a	Then it is Yeah .
72809	1	a	Okay .
72810	0	a	Kay ,
72811	1	a	what else ?
72812	0	a	Yeah ,
72813	0	a	we have to keep Yeah .
72814	0	a	So ,
72815	0	a	no speech recognition ?
72816	0	a	Or
72817	0	a	Yeah ,
72818	0	a	and then we have different languages .
72819	0	a	Well ,
72820	0	a	if it could be done , we
72821	0	a	Yeah .
72822	0	a	Y
72823	0	a	it should be done .
72824	0	a	If it could be done , should be done .
72825	0	a	Yeah ,
72826	0	a	that should be anything matters .
72827	0	a	That is not so difficult at all ,
72828	0	a	because I already use on several voice operated systems ,
72829	0	a	and they are all possible to not all , but
72830	0	a	Yeah , sure , indeed .
72831	0	a	Okay ,
72832	1	a	just make a separate remote for each
72833	0	a	Okay ,
72834	0	a	so we only do this when we have enough money left .
72835	0	a	Well ,
72836	1	a	you sh you should to adjust the thing .
72837	0	a	I think it is difficult .
72838	0	a	Every language of dialects
72839	0	a	I think it is very differen difficult .
72840	0	a	Yeah .
72841	0	a	And you have to speak the so that it can understand .
72842	0	a	Yeah .
72843	0	a	I think it ca not be implemented ,
72844	0	a	but maybe
72845	0	a	Yeah , is an option , yes .
72846	1	a	You could use that
72847	1	a	n as an option , if you have money left , or something .
72848	0	a	Fifty Euro cents .
72849	0	a	Yeah .
72850	0	a	Let is do speech .
72851	0	a	Yeah .
72852	0	a	For speech recognition .
72853	0	a	Yeah .
72854	0	a	Okay .
72855	0	a	Well
72856	0	a	I have written down an an on or off button , volume selection , channel selection , the digits from one to zero , huh .
72857	0	a	or from zero to nine .
72858	0	a	a digits button to switch between one and two digits , mute button , a separate menu for teletext , a battery indicator .
72859	0	a	we are going to use a docking station and probably LCD and if there is enough money , speech recognition .
72860	0	a	And the possibility to enlarge buttons or to have large buttons in general .
72861	0	a	, yes .
72862	0	a	Yeah .
72863	0	a	I
72864	0	a	With teletext if it was not ver very important ,
72865	0	a	it was but
72866	0	a	You also now have colours .
72867	0	a	No ,
72868	0	a	but
72869	0	a	Curved ?
72870	0	a	I do not know if we should implement that .
72871	0	a	Yeah ,
72872	0	a	when you press the red button , you go to page one hundred two ,
72873	0	a	and when you press the
72874	0	a	I do not know if we should implement that ,
72875	0	a	because it says that teletext not really important ,
72876	0	a	but yeah , the shortcut ,
72877	0	a	and you ca not go to sport .
72878	0	a	yeah .
72879	0	a	S
72880	0	a	Shortcuts .
72881	0	a	I think we should we could that
72882	1	a	we could also implement a audio settings , screen settings and channel settings , but as sub menus .
72883	0	a	Yeah .
72884	0	a	D
72885	1	a	Mainly if you turn the remote control on , you have to u you have to see from one till zero , channel and volume .
72886	1	a	And if you want to use teletext screen or audio , then you can press it .
72887	0	a	Sh
72888	0	a	Yeah ,
72889	0	a	just
72890	1	a	just sub menu .
72891	1	a	It should be available
72892	0	a	but not not
72893	0	a	Yeah .
72894	1	a	Yeah .
72895	1	a	Cause it should be there .
72896	0	a	Not directly available .
72897	0	a	Yeah .
72898	0	a	Okay .
72899	0	a	Okay ,
72900	0	a	so not too much teletext support , but in a separate menu ,
72901	0	a	and
72902	0	a	Okay ,
72903	1	a	but no more buttons or functions ,
72904	0	a	or ?
72905	0	a	Are not we forgetting something very important ?
72906	0	a	Ping .
72907	0	a	Yeah .
72908	0	a	So actually it is there
72909	0	a	but it is just not
72910	0	a	r ready there .
72911	0	a	Yeah ,
72912	0	a	but s
72913	0	a	Yeah .
72914	0	a	Directly available .
72915	0	a	So does it confuse the user ?
72916	0	a	You will have to search for it .
72917	1	a	They would have to be easy to use .
72918	0	a	I will search .
72919	1	a	If you want to use teletext , you can push the teletext button and then the options become available .
72920	0	a	Yeah .
72921	0	a	Yeah ,
72922	0	a	that is a
72923	0	a	I guess not .
72924	0	a	The sign of it .
72925	0	a	no .
72926	0	a	No .
72927	0	a	What else can you do with a television ?
72928	0	a	play , pause , does not n need to be there .
72929	0	a	We have got anon
72930	0	a	Have got got two examples here , but I do not think there is anything we are missing .
72931	0	a	Well ,
72932	0	a	we do not have the video orders
72933	0	a	Yeah ,
72934	1	a	you could look here
72935	0	a	all the the th th th th
72936	0	a	I do not know , technical functions .
72937	0	a	Yes ,
72938	0	a	so
72939	0	a	this is your presentation .
72940	1	a	We could check the other remote controls with technical functions .
72941	0	a	Which ones were yours ?
72942	0	a	Techni
72943	0	a	Ja ja ja ja ja .
72944	0	a	They are a bit small , you can we should stretch them ,
72945	0	a	because
72946	0	a	I guess we have got them all .
72947	0	a	Technical functions .
72948	0	a	Yeah okay .
72949	0	a	I think I go to have volume , mute
72950	0	a	but I
72951	0	a	Yeah .
72952	0	a	Very slow .
72953	0	a	Yeah ,
72954	0	a	the zoom buttons .
72955	0	a	And for a TV ?
72956	0	a	Can you zoom in a TV ?
72957	0	a	Or that you can put them on on on wide and
72958	0	a	yeah .
72959	0	a	Yeah ,
72960	0	a	b
72961	0	a	wide screen , high screen , different things you have ,
72962	0	a	yeah
72963	0	a	different
72964	0	a	Yeah .
72965	1	a	But that should also be a sub then , a sub menu thing .
72966	0	a	Menu .
72967	0	a	Yeah
72968	1	a	it should be available , but then in separate screen settings or something .
72969	0	a	Yeah ,
72970	0	a	so we should also implement se screen settings .
72971	0	a	Yeah , screen settings , audio settings , teletext settings you have .
72972	0	a	Oh right .
72973	0	a	Yeah .
72974	0	a	Channel settings .
72975	0	a	Yeah ,
72976	0	a	so you can program the
72977	0	a	Yeah ,
72978	0	a	so the first you see the main ,
72979	0	a	and the other ones you can go to
72980	0	a	Yeah .
72981	0	a	So those four , and of course the main .
72982	0	a	Yeah .
72983	0	a	Yeah .
72984	0	a	Like tap screens or something
72985	0	a	or , I dunno .
72986	0	a	I hope we can do this .
72987	0	a	Something
72988	0	a	Yeah ,
72989	0	a	if
72990	0	a	No ,
72991	0	a	you do not yu a
72992	0	a	no
72993	0	a	you then you do not no ni do not
72994	0	a	then you do not use it .
72995	0	a	There are a lot of options depending on what kind of television you got .
72996	0	a	Cause if you do not got a wide screen television you do not need the the screen settings
72997	0	a	for
72998	0	a	Yeah
72999	0	a	and if the television does not support such operations
73000	0	a	Yeah .
73001	1	a	We do not have to use that top .
73002	1	a	Yeah .
73003	0	a	Yeah .
73004	1	a	So you leave it alone .
73005	0	a	Yeah .
73006	0	a	Yeah .
73007	1	a	Or it could be possible to have a a standard version of the remote , an expanded version .
73008	0	a	Yeah .
73009	0	a	And do we want them in different colours ,
73010	0	a	or And
73011	0	a	and the buttons , should they have colours ?
73012	0	a	Oh
73013	0	a	but we do not have any buttons .
73014	0	a	Yeah .
73015	0	a	Colours .
73016	0	a	Yeah .
73017	0	a	Colours I think the main colour of the remote control is the colour of the LCD screen .
73018	0	a	Yeah .
73019	0	a	I Because we do not want a lot a devi
73020	0	a	yeah
73021	0	a	a device self s
73022	0	a	g
73023	0	a	Okay ,
73024	0	a	so use very lot of peo
73025	0	a	Adjust with phones , yes
73026	0	a	Okay .
73027	0	a	Yeah .
73028	0	a	Yeah ,
73029	0	a	then defines itself .
73030	0	a	Because how many percent ?
73031	0	a	Eighty percent ?
73032	0	a	Would spend more money if it looks fancy .
73033	0	a	They think it is ugly ,
73034	0	a	right ?
73035	1	a	Perhaps you can make adjustable fronts , like with the telephones .
73036	0	a	You can
73037	0	a	But I do not think that
73038	0	a	Yeah .
73039	0	a	Twelve Euro fifty .
73040	0	a	Well ,
73041	0	a	make it available in different colours , you mean ?
73042	0	a	Sure .
73043	0	a	Yeah .
73044	1	a	Red , white , blue , black .
73045	0	a	Rasta colours .
73046	0	a	And a see through
73047	0	a	Okay , well
73048	0	a	that is the signal for las final five minutes .
73049	1	a	Grey .
73050	0	a	Yeah sea view , yes , Simpson is versions and Leave .
73051	0	a	Yeah .
73052	0	a	Yeah ,
73053	0	a	see through version .
73054	0	a	Yeah .
73055	0	a	If you press a button , it turns green .
73056	0	a	Yeah .
73057	0	a	A disco version .
73058	0	a	Five minutes ?
73059	0	a	Oh yeah , right .
73060	0	a	so
73061	0	a	I have the things I just read .
73062	0	a	then we have separate menus for teletext , screen settings , audio settings ,
73063	0	a	and what else ?
73064	0	a	Channel settings .
73065	0	a	Yeah .
73066	0	a	Channel settings ?
73067	0	a	Yeah .
73068	0	a	So you can program the TV .
73069	0	a	Okay .
73070	1	a	Perhaps you should you would throw them on on in one pile .
73071	1	a	So , options , and then you sub them .
73072	0	a	Yeah .
73073	0	a	Otherwise you have all those teletext , perhaps teletext not ,
73074	0	a	but
73075	0	a	Yeah ,
73076	0	a	but I
73077	0	a	Yeah .
73078	0	a	Could be possible .
73079	0	a	Or like you have a menu button , you press
73080	0	a	Yeah ,
73081	1	a	or otherwise you have a menu button , press menu then you have main menu search all the all the settings .
73082	0	a	No ,
73083	0	a	we said teletext also a separate menu .
73084	0	a	Yeah .
73085	0	a	Okay ,
73086	1	a	but we can work that out later , I guess .
73087	0	a	But
73088	0	a	I do not know .
73089	0	a	Yeah , no problem .
73090	0	a	So
73091	0	a	we are having a a general menu with the most used functions , teletext , screen settings , audio settings , channel settings ,
73092	1	a	and maybe there are options for the remote itself ?
73093	1	a	Like large icons or small icons
73094	0	a	and
73095	0	a	I do not know what else ,
73096	0	a	but
73097	0	a	Yeah ,
73098	0	a	but on the LCD ,
73099	0	a	huh ?
73100	0	a	Right ,
73101	0	a	yeah ,
73102	0	a	okay .
73103	0	a	Yep .
73104	0	a	I think b
73105	0	a	because we do not have a lot of buttons on the one screen ,
73106	0	a	I think the buttons
73107	0	a	Yeah ,
73108	0	a	but but or like you have
73109	0	a	you only have channel button or volume button .
73110	0	a	No .
73111	0	a	Or do we have any buttons ?
73112	0	a	On the remote .
73113	0	a	Which one ?
73114	0	a	But that is also in the LCD ,
73115	0	a	right ?
73116	0	a	So we do not have any normal buttons
73117	0	a	that
73118	0	a	No , alright .
73119	0	a	Those buttons you can you can
73120	0	a	Yeah .
73121	0	a	Yeah ,
73122	0	a	th
73123	0	a	No , no normal buttons , yeah .
73124	1	a	Maybe only the on and o on and off button .
73125	0	a	Yet on and off is p is perhaps you kno
73126	0	a	No , no .
73127	0	a	But we do not need a special
73128	1	a	we do not need a special options menu for the remote itself .
73129	0	a	not button
73130	0	a	Yeah sure , of course you need a settings button , or a settings option for the remote control .
73131	0	a	But I do not think
73132	0	a	no .
73133	0	a	Okay .
73134	0	a	Oh well ,
73135	1	a	you should be able to set which TV you have .
73136	0	a	If you have if you have
73137	0	a	Yeah .
73138	0	a	But is not idea to use what you said , normal on and off button for the TV ,
73139	0	a	that you do not have to use a
73140	0	a	Yeah
73141	0	a	but
73142	0	a	but not for the remote but for the TV ,
73143	0	a	that you use
73144	1	a	But a not as normal button , in the LCD ,
73145	0	a	yeah .
73146	0	a	No no no ,
73147	0	a	because we we discussed that you could charge it , otherwise is it it jumps to stand by mode automatically .
73148	0	a	Yeah ,
73149	1	a	but a TV of course , th that is the I think that is a best thing
73150	1	a	is that to implement that one in the menu with the volume and channel .
73151	0	a	No .
73152	0	a	Well
73153	1	a	maybe there should be a separate button apart from the LCD ,
73154	0	a	because you ca not turn it on when the LCD is off .
73155	0	a	So how do you turn the thing on ?
73156	1	a	There has to be a on button on the remote ,
73157	0	a	huh ?
73158	0	a	Tap the thing .
73159	0	a	No
73160	0	a	you just tap I think .
73161	0	a	Yeah , you tap .
73162	0	a	Just tap it .
73163	0	a	Touch screen ,
73164	0	a	yeah
73165	0	a	then it is turn turn off , turn on .
73166	0	a	Okay .
73167	0	a	And then the television is on also , or just the remote ?
73168	0	a	No , just the remote .
73169	0	a	A television do not have to be on ,
73170	1	a	that one you can press on ,
73171	0	a	yeah stand by ,
73172	1	a	then press on remote , press on and then TV should be available .
73173	0	a	But
73174	0	a	Yeah a
73175	0	a	yeah .
73176	0	a	Yeah ,
73177	1	a	it should be in standby mode ,
73178	0	a	but A A
73179	0	a	A normal button on the remote control ,
73180	0	a	or norm ?
73181	0	a	Yeah ,
73182	1	a	because when you touch the LCD screen when it is in standby mode , it should pop on .
73183	1	a	Or not .
73184	1	a	I do not know whether it is handy to have a n a normal on button , a r just rubber for for TV ,
73185	0	a	so you can turn it on and then you can choose the channel .
73186	0	a	Separate .
73187	0	a	Otherwise you I do not know whether
73188	0	a	or not that is
73189	0	a	Yeah ,
73190	0	a	yeah .
73191	0	a	To turn it on .
73192	0	a	Of
73193	1	a	or you should put it in the LCD screen .
73194	0	a	Yeah ,
73195	0	a	I have ,
73196	0	a	yeah .
73197	0	a	Okay ,
73198	0	a	well Yeah .
73199	0	a	Wh
73200	0	a	why would it be a a need to have a normal button ?
73201	0	a	Well
73202	0	a	I
73203	0	a	I guess if you use the LCD screen , you first have to search where is the on button ,
73204	0	a	then you you you
73205	0	a	then turn it , and then the TV goes on .
73206	0	a	But if you have a normal on button on the on the remote , then you do the on , and then you search the channel which you want .
73207	0	a	Yeah ,
73208	1	a	but I think the re the remote control , if you press tap the screen , it always should jump to the screen which has the volume button , channel button , and of course of also the on and off button .
73209	0	a	Oh right .
73210	0	a	I think it looks a lot more fancy if you use if you do not have any buttons on the s on on remote control .
73211	0	a	Yeah , I think so too .
73212	0	a	Otherwise y wet e k Yeah .
73213	0	a	Yeah .
73214	0	a	So actually we are going to create a a button less remote .
73215	0	a	Yeah .
73216	0	a	No buttons at all .
73217	0	a	Okay , well
73218	1	a	that is might be a unique selling point , huh for a remote .
73219	0	a	If we can afford it .
73220	0	a	Okay , well
73221	1	a	I guess we have to postpone further discussion to our next meeting ,
73222	0	a	because we are running out of time .
73223	0	a	Yeah , if we can afford it .
73224	0	a	Yeah .
73225	0	a	Oh , okay
73226	0	a	Oh .
73227	0	a	for now , we are having a lunch break , and then there will be half an hour for the next share of individual work .
73228	1	a	I will write minutes , if I can create them out of this .
73229	1	a	And put them in the the project documents folder .
73230	0	a	And here are the individual actions for the for the other roles .
73231	0	a	And of course specific instructions will be sent to you again by your personal coach .
73232	0	a	Alright .
73233	0	a	Luckily as we are .
73234	0	a	Okay , well
73235	0	a	Lunch .
73236	0	a	Okay .
73237	0	a	Food .
73238	0	a	Should we put this back in our rooms ,
73239	0	a	or ?
73240	0	a	 
73241	0	a	Okay ,
73242	0	a	welcome everyone to our next meeting .
73243	0	a	I am busy writing and busy leading the meeting , but I have prepared a little presentation once again or at least an agenda
73244	0	a	I think the biggest part of the presentation will be on your side .
73245	0	a	we are here at the conceptual design meeting , which is hereby opened .
73246	0	a	once again I will try to write some minutes
73247	0	a	which I just from the previous meeting placed inside our project folder , which was quite some typing .
73248	0	a	today we once again have three presentations , if I am right , and after that we will take a decision on the remote control concepts .
73249	0	a	And just as the last time we have forty minutes to accomplish that .
73250	0	a	Okay , well
73251	1	a	I would say let is start with the first presentation .
73252	0	a	Kay .
73253	0	a	in the same order as last time ?
73254	0	a	Okay .
73255	0	a	W
73256	0	a	sure .
73257	0	a	Alright .
73258	0	a	Well ,
73259	1	a	take it away .
73260	0	a	Okay
73261	0	a	welcome you all .
73262	1	a	Components design , first of all I would like to accommodate some of those things I elaborate some of the things I did .
73263	0	a	I I elaborated on the concept .
73264	0	a	What should be said about the components , its properties and what kind of materials should we use to to make one of those r remote controls .
73265	0	a	well
73266	0	a	first of all I have d subtracted some of the components that is that are used are w w you know from what the remote control is formed .
73267	1	a	first of all , the case , the case , the surrounding of the of the the remote control .
73268	1	a	I would like to give you an idea of how I thought about .
73269	1	a	Do not destroy my giraffe .
73270	0	a	Giraffe is gone now .
73271	0	a	Okay
73272	1	a	the case was is made from rubber , I suppose .
73273	0	a	There is one of the because when you use a remote control a lot of people will will drop their remote control and they break
73274	0	a	becau
73275	0	a	the titanium was also an option .
73276	0	a	Drop it .
73277	0	a	But it is a very expensive material .
73278	0	a	rubber is , I think , the best suitable material to use for our for our remote control .
73279	0	a	it is poss it is also possible to create fancy colours with rubber .
73280	0	a	rubber l makes it easy to to to it lets lets itself colour .
73281	0	a	titanium you have to paint it and with that it is possible to scratch it
73282	0	a	or
73283	0	a	yeah make it ugly .
73284	0	a	rubber the total piece of rubber that is sor that is that is used to make the case is the same colour , so if you scratch it it is still the same colour , perhaps it is a little bit damaged .
73285	0	a	But it is a very strong material .
73286	1	a	I h I had an idea single covered curved , sorry , single curved .
73287	0	a	so
73288	0	a	it is t two dimensional .
73289	1	a	I think it is it is best to draw
73290	0	a	oh
73291	0	a	green .
73292	0	a	It is a colour .
73293	0	a	Bright colour .
73294	0	a	New .
73295	0	a	Fancy colour .
73296	0	a	Forward .
73297	0	a	Blank .
73298	0	a	Okay .
73299	0	a	You have to go t
73300	0	a	Oh
73301	0	a	it is a side view .
73302	1	a	Let is make it black .
73303	0	a	Okay .
73304	0	a	I thought of an idea like this .
73305	0	a	Oh that .
73306	0	a	delete .
73307	0	a	Blank .
73308	0	a	Okay .
73309	0	a	So it also looks nice when it is on your table .
73310	0	a	So you get
73311	1	a	it does not lay flat down on the table , but it is c
73312	1	a	it is stands .
73313	0	a	Side view
73314	0	a	yes it is side view
73315	0	a	so
73316	0	a	I
73317	0	a	I am not technically good at th three D modelling ,
73318	0	a	but .
73319	0	a	it is just an idea I had
73320	0	a	so it is it is very
73321	0	a	so its also looks nice when it is on the table .
73322	0	a	the graphical user interface and the buttons , we also thought about that already .
73323	1	a	I thought about the LCD touch screen ,
73324	0	a	which is is easy to clean too .
73325	0	a	One of the great advantages of the LCD screen you just use some or another cleaning cl some cleaning stuff .
73326	1	a	And it should be made of strong plastic and it should be bright .
73327	0	a	Well
73328	0	a	I already s explained some properties of that material
73329	0	a	and I think
73330	0	a	well
73331	0	a	we also we almost concluded about that
73332	1	a	this should be our button component .
73333	0	a	True .
73334	0	a	So
73335	0	a	that is all about the buttons .
73336	0	a	the batteries , we also thought about that already ,
73337	1	a	will be chargeable with an option for a mount station
73338	0	a	so you can put the the remote control in a mount station so its charges itself up instead of plugging it in or something like that .
73339	0	a	Questions , ?
73340	0	a	No no no
73341	0	a	no no .
73342	0	a	No .
73343	0	a	Just looking .
73344	1	a	And they should be long lasting , not not be empty in about two minutes or thirty minutes or forty minutes of use .
73345	0	a	And next step is the chip th the component that is makes or transmits the signal to the television .
73346	0	a	there was an option to use s a rather simple chip
73347	1	a	but I think because of our highly requiring requirements , there should be an advanced chip in it with also the ability to facilitate speaker speech recognition
73348	0	a	which unfortunately is still in a test phase ,
73349	0	a	so
73350	1	a	there should be some more investigation on that side .
73351	1	a	my personal preferences
73352	0	a	I also overheard in the last meeting that there shou we should use our own business colours .
73353	0	a	That was correct , was not it ?
73354	0	a	Okay .
73355	0	a	I think they are rather boring for for use with rubber .
73356	0	a	Well ,
73357	0	a	business colours I thought it was the the slogan and the corporate image ,
73358	0	a	so yeah , it needs colour , but I do not think you have to make the entire thing in the corporate colour .
73359	0	a	Okay
73360	0	a	they should be m sh they should be in mind ,
73361	0	a	was not it ?
73362	0	a	Okay
73363	0	a	so it d it does not says to have the slogan ?
73364	0	a	Okay okay .
73365	0	a	It must be recognisable .
73366	0	a	Well
73367	0	a	that is possible of course .
73368	1	a	We could make a little R and R on the top of the machine .
73369	1	a	You can put the R and R .
73370	0	a	so
73371	0	a	they are pretty boring ,
73372	1	a	I suggest , because just the availability with rubber to make fantastic colours and also in a lot of possible colours , so it is possible to make very fancy remote controls
73373	0	a	which peopl who people in
73374	0	a	which people will find they are interesting .
73375	0	a	And will buy them faster when they look at the same old grey or black colours .
73376	0	a	s as I said before rubber is is impossible to damage severely
73377	0	a	imp instead of
73378	0	a	of course you can break it when you you when you break it in s for example with a pair of scissors or something like that , but i if you drop it it is not broken right away s instead of using plastic , hard plastic or titanium .
73379	0	a	And I personally liked the single curved remote control ,
73380	0	a	because it yeah
73381	0	a	it makes sense .
73382	0	a	Okay .
73383	0	a	Well
73384	0	a	that is all about my my findings .
73385	0	a	Alright .
73386	0	a	Okay ,
73387	0	a	thank you .
73388	1	a	I will go next .
73389	1	a	Next .
73390	0	a	Alright
73391	0	a	so
73392	0	a	I thought a little bit about the interface .
73393	0	a	how it should look .
73394	0	a	And we determined that will not be no buttons , but only an LCD screen , so I had to look on that .
73395	0	a	And the design is therefore based on what we just thought of .
73396	1	a	first there are some new findings and new technology for speech recognition .
73397	0	a	And this is that you you ask you give a question through through the device and it answers you .
73398	0	a	And they already put this in an in a coffee maker .
73399	0	a	And so that it you say good morning , coffee maker , and it says t says to you back good morning Joe or what is your name .
73400	0	a	This and there is an easy way to program that you say record into the device into the speaker and then you say the question and
73401	0	a	three seconds later you say the answer and then when you say the question it gives you the answer .
73402	0	a	perhaps it is useful ,
73403	0	a	perhaps for because people lose the remote , they can yell remote where are you and calls or something .
73404	0	a	It is true .
73405	1	a	And perhaps we could implement that .
73406	1	a	And then I have to go out of the presentation
73407	0	a	because I tried to make some kind of a a idea of how it should look like
73408	0	a	but I ca not draw ,
73409	0	a	so
73410	1	a	do not make too much of it .
73411	0	a	Oh my God .
73412	0	a	I tried to the LCD screen I tried to sort of to draw .
73413	0	a	I thought at least the icon for the volume .
73414	1	a	I do not know if there is an icon for the program ,
73415	0	a	but
73416	0	a	yeah .
73417	1	a	Not just a P .
73418	1	a	P
73419	0	a	yeah , just a P .
73420	0	a	So
73421	0	a	and then the buttons above and below the and the and the mute button also recognisable as an icon .
73422	0	a	Where is where is the button for two ?
73423	0	a	Okay .
73424	0	a	I forgot that one .
73425	0	a	I thought I forgot something ,
73426	0	a	but .
73427	0	a	And and the numbers ,
73428	1	a	that should be a bit larger
73429	0	a	I think it is not really on scale and and so forth .
73430	0	a	Does not matter .
73431	0	a	an options button .
73432	1	a	And I thought the the button for teletext apar apart
73433	0	a	because it is not really options , I think .
73434	0	a	It is options is the settings of the remote and of the TV and that kind of thing .
73435	0	a	No .
73436	0	a	Yep .
73437	1	a	So could call it settings or something .
73438	0	a	But this is a bit how I thought it .
73439	1	a	And the LCD somewhere on the remote .
73440	1	a	Perhaps we could be more curvy the remote perhaps should ,
73441	0	a	so that it is better in your hand or something .
73442	0	a	Oh okay ,
73443	0	a	yeah .
73444	0	a	But and and a microph microphone for the speech recognition if we want to implement that .
73445	0	a	and then if you press the op options button , now we have an example of
73446	0	a	and then you should get the other options with what what you could do
73447	1	a	and that you could do with something like this this .
73448	0	a	Oh yeah , .
73449	0	a	And it is also
73450	0	a	I thought think we discussed earlier that older people do not really want to use these extra settings .
73451	0	a	And older people a also do not really want to use this th this kind of option menus .
73452	0	a	So they want to u use one button and then something happens , and not choose with this kind of
73453	1	a	And you could put in a an a really s little scrolling device on the side of your remote ,
73454	0	a	so you could scroll scroll across these things .
73455	0	a	Okay .
73456	0	a	That is an option .
73457	0	a	And that was my finding
73458	0	a	dinge .
73459	0	a	Thanks .
73460	0	a	Yeah .
73461	1	a	Okay .
73462	0	a	Now our third team member with his presentation .
73463	0	a	Go Danny , go Danny .
73464	0	a	Okay ,
73465	1	a	I am going to tell you something about a trend watching .
73466	1	a	The trends from the past years , what the people like , what the youngsters like , what the elderly people liked about shapes , colours , material and stuff .
73467	0	a	Kay .
73468	0	a	The method I used was
73469	0	a	Like I told I watched the trends from the past years about colours , shapes , material they wanted from elderly and young people .
73470	1	a	So we can keep that in mind for designing f the device itself .
73471	1	a	Findings I made .
73472	0	a	The most important thing people liked last year was that the remote control should be look look fancy .
73473	0	a	The second important thing that w should be if inv in innov innovative ,
73474	0	a	okay ,
73475	0	a	like the LCD screen that is quite innovative
73476	0	a	so that should be great meeting for this .
73477	0	a	And the third thing is it should be easy to use .
73478	1	a	I think with only one menu , four button , channel , volume , it should also be enough for easy to use .
73479	0	a	The personal preferences for the young people , they liked fruity colours like banana yellow , strawberry red and stuff .
73480	0	a	Fruity ?
73481	0	a	Fruity .
73482	0	a	Grass green .
73483	0	a	Yeah .
73484	0	a	Like that .
73485	0	a	The round shapes , and soft material m materials like the rubber .
73486	1	a	It should be soft
73487	1	a	i it should feeling spongy or s Sponge Bob like things .
73488	0	a	Okay .
73489	0	a	Let is build it into a sponge .
73490	0	a	Th
73491	0	a	Elderly people like au colours which y are being seen in autumn like woods dark brown , red , deep reds and stuff .
73492	0	a	They liked square shapes with round edges .
73493	0	a	And hard materials like wood , titanium .
73494	0	a	They
73495	0	a	those kind of materials they liked .
73496	0	a	This is a bit like the young peoples like the fruity colours , innovative , all the colours you see , the blue , the red , the white , the yellow , that stuff .
73497	1	a	And then I th
73498	1	a	I
73499	1	a	I personally thought the front side of the shape should be something for the youngsters like like this or something .
73500	0	a	Oh
73501	0	a	y
73502	0	a	So for the older people , a more traditional form .
73503	0	a	It is it is a bit like a banana .
73504	1	a	And the colour should be yellow , or something .
73505	1	a	And for the elderly people just plain old .
73506	0	a	Because we decided to have two kind of remotes , two designs ,
73507	0	a	or was it two colours ?
73508	0	a	Different colours , yeah .
73509	0	a	It was one remote , I think ,
73510	0	a	different colours .
73511	1	a	We should decide whether it is going to be with round shapes .
73512	1	a	I think like my colleague , you said , is that is e better , or for the elderly people something like like the iPod or something , with round squares .
73513	0	a	Simple but easy to use .
73514	0	a	So that is it .
73515	0	a	Okay .
73516	0	a	That is my
73517	0	a	Yeah ,
73518	0	a	like the older o older colours I can maybe
73519	0	a	Yeah .
73520	1	a	You could you could change the colours , that was also the idea .
73521	0	a	I do not know which shape you should should take ,
73522	0	a	but .
73523	0	a	Colours th the elderly people
73524	0	a	Look something like that .
73525	0	a	Yeah ,
73526	0	a	I guess changing colours will be easier than changing the shape of it .
73527	0	a	Yeah .
73528	0	a	Changing just the shape of the remote control ?
73529	0	a	Yeah ,
73530	0	a	s
73531	0	a	round corners , but s but square , yeah .
73532	1	a	Perhaps you could find something in the middle .
73533	1	a	Round but square .
73534	0	a	Yeah .
73535	0	a	But maybe then both groups wo not buy it .
73536	0	a	Yeah .
73537	1	a	i i if you do it square , with round corners but a little in the middle of it
73538	0	a	i
73539	0	a	Do you know what I mean ?
73540	1	a	wait , like like this a bit .
73541	0	a	Yeah I know what you mean ,
73542	0	a	kind of like a .
73543	0	a	Yeah .
73544	0	a	So it is a bit square , but it is also a bit round .
73545	0	a	Kinda like a beer glass .
73546	0	a	So
73547	1	a	but then Same sides .
73548	0	a	Yeah .
73549	0	a	I know what you mean .
73550	0	a	It is also easy to to have to to put in your hand .
73551	0	a	But that is
73552	0	a	Yeah
73553	0	a	but that is also how other remotes are shaped ,
73554	0	a	so that is
73555	0	a	But perhaps that is a good thing , so that is easy to use .
73556	0	a	Yeah .
73557	0	a	People know the
73558	0	a	Yeah .
73559	0	a	Will recognise that is as a remote control .
73560	0	a	when I saw your d
73561	0	a	Oh .
73562	0	a	Autumn colours like red , brown .
73563	0	a	They liked the wood a lot .
73564	0	a	Huh .
73565	1	a	So maybe we could give it like wooden loo look look or something in that colour .
73566	0	a	Yeah .
73567	0	a	Yeah .
73568	0	a	Yeah ,
73569	0	a	kind of like old cars ,
73570	1	a	Let is put it all together .
73571	1	a	And a bit bit old school style renaissance , medieval kind of things .
73572	0	a	Yeah .
73573	0	a	Swords .
73574	0	a	Those kind of
73575	0	a	Yeah , those kind of things .
73576	0	a	So you see the big difference
73577	0	a	between the young people ?
73578	0	a	Fresh , exciting .
73579	0	a	Yeah .
73580	0	a	And the old people , old and boring .
73581	0	a	But that is easily to do with the colour , I think .
73582	0	a	So
73583	0	a	Sorry ?
73584	0	a	Yeah I think it is it is easier to do in colour than in shape .
73585	0	a	That is easy to do with the colours , I think .
73586	0	a	Yeah .
73587	0	a	Because otherwise we have to get different shapes ,
73588	0	a	and colour way easier than yeah
73589	0	a	the shapes .
73590	0	a	Yeah we think so too .
73591	0	a	In material
73592	0	a	yeah
73593	0	a	rubber , rubber is ,
73594	0	a	like I said , young people like more soft materials and spongy ones and the old people like plain wood .
73595	0	a	Yeah .
73596	0	a	Yeah .
73597	1	a	So we have to decide if we are going to use real hard rubber , or soft rubber .
73598	0	a	Yeah
73599	0	a	think
73600	1	a	Also in between .
73601	1	a	Or something something between that .
73602	0	a	Soft rubber .
73603	0	a	Yeah soft rubber which you can you can feel in it .
73604	0	a	Yeah I know what you .
73605	1	a	I do not think you should be able to mould it ,
73606	0	a	but
73607	0	a	Yeah .
73608	0	a	Or
73609	0	a	No .
73610	0	a	Or or wh
73611	0	a	what is something harder .
73612	0	a	It should should not be .
73613	0	a	No no no
73614	0	a	but but you have to
73615	1	a	like like like a a eraser or something .
73616	1	a	That is the bit you can press it in , or something harder .
73617	0	a	Bit like this kind of rubber .
73618	0	a	This
73619	0	a	But it is quite hard , this .
73620	0	a	Yeah , something like this , yeah .
73621	0	a	Yeah it is quite hard
73622	0	a	but you can press it in .
73623	0	a	Yeah .
73624	0	a	It is feels kind s spongy .
73625	0	a	Spongy .
73626	0	a	Something .
73627	0	a	I do not think it is rubber .
73628	0	a	No .
73629	0	a	N n n
73630	0	a	Are you going to invite Sponge Bob ,
73631	0	a	maybe he can
73632	0	a	Yeah I think that is the better thing to do .
73633	0	a	So we need a spongy feeling .
73634	0	a	did you have something about
73635	1	a	So we should first decide about shape , I think .
73636	0	a	Yeah .
73637	0	a	Ding ding .
73638	0	a	Which
73639	1	a	Then you can fit the LCD screen in it , and can decide .
73640	0	a	I also s ca not help but notice that you used an you had a remote control and the LCD screen was rather small .
73641	0	a	Yeah
73642	0	a	w I think that LCD screen should be like
73643	0	a	Yeah
73644	1	a	three quarter of the of the
73645	0	a	Yeah
73646	0	a	the buttons wo not get that small when the LCD screen is
73647	0	a	Yeah
73648	0	a	it it is supposed to be bit s bit s bit
73649	0	a	Yeah .
73650	0	a	This was your size ,
73651	1	a	but I think it should be larger .
73652	0	a	Yeah , three quarters .
73653	0	a	So so you do not have to put your oh .
73654	0	a	new , blank .
73655	0	a	So
73656	0	a	when you get this
73657	0	a	kind of like this .
73658	0	a	Ooh
73659	0	a	Yeah .
73660	0	a	Or should it be larger ?
73661	0	a	Larger ?
73662	0	a	Because you want to put your hands
73663	0	a	You want
73664	0	a	Yeah .
73665	0	a	Larger I think .
73666	0	a	But if you pu
73667	0	a	Now you can put your hand there and then you wo not touch the screen .
73668	0	a	Yeah
73669	0	a	becau because you have
73670	0	a	Yeah okay , true , true , true true .
73671	0	a	Perhaps that is best .
73672	0	a	Your thumb here .
73673	0	a	But not on the screen because
73674	0	a	Yeah
73675	0	a	that is that is an idea .
73676	0	a	Yeah .
73677	0	a	Yeah .
73678	0	a	Looks a bit like a Game Boy now .
73679	0	a	Because when you put your f
73680	0	a	Yeah
73681	0	a	but if yo if you make the the LCD screen as large as the remote control itself , you will you will always get some
73682	0	a	You
73683	0	a	Yeah .
73684	0	a	You always touch it ,
73685	0	a	yeah .
73686	0	a	Yeah
73687	0	a	yeah
73688	0	a	yeah
73689	0	a	yeah .
73690	0	a	Going to be very greasy and stuff .
73691	1	a	But it wo not get that small
73692	0	a	because you have how much ?
73693	0	a	Nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen buttons on the screen .
73694	0	a	Yeah .
73695	0	a	One to zero , the two digit ,
73696	0	a	You have to you have to
73697	0	a	Because some fat people with d thick fingers will press three buttons at same time .
73698	0	a	Yeah you do not want it too small .
73699	1	a	How yeah how large
73700	0	a	Yeah they have thick fingers .
73701	0	a	But if you want to make it in international ,
73702	0	a	Japanese people got rather small hands
73703	0	a	and we got these large
73704	0	a	Zoom opt
73705	0	a	yeah of course ,
73706	0	a	yeah .
73707	0	a	Yeah true ,
73708	0	a	but
73709	0	a	Yeah ,
73710	1	a	we have we have the zoom option ,
73711	0	a	right ?
73712	0	a	Yeah .
73713	1	a	You can make it larger to to to with accompanying greater fields to push the button .
73714	0	a	Yeah .
73715	0	a	Yeah .
73716	1	a	And we wo not include a a pen , or something to point ,
73717	0	a	hey ,
73718	1	a	we we want to do it with our fingers ,
73719	0	a	right ?
73720	0	a	Yeah .
73721	0	a	No .
73722	0	a	Yeah .
73723	0	a	Your fingers , yeah .
73724	0	a	Yeah .
73725	0	a	You do not want
73726	0	a	Because if you lose the pen if you lose the pen you ca not use
73727	0	a	Yeah
73728	0	a	You can do whatever any cloth .
73729	0	a	Y you could include a pen
73730	0	a	Use a pen You you c
73731	0	a	you can lose the pen .
73732	0	a	Yeah
73733	0	a	but I think people want to use a remote with with their fingers because th they are used to that
73734	0	a	and
73735	1	a	And maybe we have to add a tissue to remove the grease from all the fingers , huh .
73736	0	a	Yeah
73737	0	a	the fingers , yeah .
73738	0	a	Yeah o
73739	0	a	yeah , if they think it is handy to use a pen .
73740	0	a	Yeah
73741	0	a	I think this this is a good size for the screen .
73742	1	a	I do not know how how large the actual remote should be
73743	1	a	but a little bit like this , or something .
73744	0	a	Yeah .
73745	0	a	Yeah
73746	0	a	but that that can be with plain soft tissue .
73747	0	a	Yeah ,
73748	0	a	you can buy those at
73749	1	a	Maybe it is better to to include rechargeable batteries which you can recharge through the docking station .
73750	0	a	Okay well
73751	0	a	maybe , if I can interrupt you ,
73752	1	a	maybe I should should show some points on which we should take a decision .
73753	0	a	Sure .
73754	1	a	So we can discuss these points .
73755	0	a	those points energy question mark .
73756	1	a	How how should we supply the thing with energy
73757	0	a	and how
73758	0	a	are we going to do it with separate docking station and then put in it .
73759	0	a	chip on print and case .
73760	0	a	Those are points my coach advised me to discuss here ,
73761	1	a	but I hope you have ideas about them .
73762	1	a	I think energy were batteries
73763	0	a	and then and
73764	0	a	Yeah .
73765	0	a	The docking station .
73766	0	a	Yeah .
73767	0	a	So that is the the the first point .
73768	0	a	We already decided that on the previous meeting .
73769	0	a	W
73770	0	a	Yeah .
73771	0	a	Yeah .
73772	0	a	Yeah .
73773	0	a	Yeah .
73774	0	a	So
73775	0	a	if the badg the batteries are dead then you can re you can change them .
73776	0	a	Just like with the telephone .
73777	0	a	I kind of like your
73778	0	a	Yeah
73779	0	a	you got some some of those wireless mice ?
73780	0	a	Mouse .
73781	0	a	Yeah
73782	0	a	yeah
73783	0	a	yeah
73784	0	a	like those .
73785	0	a	Computer mouse .
73786	1	a	Kinda like those kind of batteries .
73787	0	a	Yep .
73788	1	a	but it should be th
73789	1	a	I think normal batteries ,
73790	0	a	not not like two or two
73791	0	a	Yeah .
73792	0	a	Yeah , normal plain
73793	0	a	you
73794	0	a	No
73795	0	a	normal plain batteries you can buy at the supermarket or retail shop .
73796	0	a	Yeah .
73797	0	a	Simple rechargeable batteries .
73798	0	a	Yeah .
73799	0	a	Yeah .
73800	0	a	what was with the chip on print ?
73801	0	a	Yeah .
73802	0	a	The chip on print ?
73803	0	a	you gotta f
73804	0	a	Yeah .
73805	0	a	I think so .
73806	0	a	Chip on print with a with a simple a sim not a simple but a
73807	0	a	We also discussed that .
73808	0	a	Print plate .
73809	0	a	Did not we ?
73810	0	a	Beg your pardon ?
73811	0	a	Yeah sure , of course
73812	0	a	, yeah .
73813	0	a	Yeah
73814	0	a	but how did this how does that with a LCD screen ?
73815	0	a	You still have a print plate .
73816	0	a	Yeah
73817	0	a	yeah
73818	0	a	yeah .
73819	0	a	You always have a print plate .
73820	0	a	You always have a print plate ,
73821	0	a	right ?
73822	0	a	Always ,
73823	0	a	so
73824	0	a	I dunno what w what we have to decide about that .
73825	0	a	Yeah well
73826	0	a	it is a good question .
73827	0	a	It just was in there
73828	0	a	and I did not have any information about it ,
73829	0	a	but
73830	0	a	Well
73831	0	a	chip on print , I think what they mean with the regular rubber buttons that you got , it is always clear for the remote control when you press a certain button .
73832	0	a	But when you got a LCD screen , with no with not the buttons are not always on the same place , for example if you enlarge a button , or if you got several options appearing on your screen , the co ordinations are not always the same .
73833	0	a	Yeah , okay .
73834	0	a	But
73835	0	a	Yeah okay ,
73836	0	a	but the p print plate of L LCD screen is more advanced than a normal print plate , so that that is not of any discussion , I think .
73837	0	a	When you got a regular button , th the button of stand by is always on the same place
73838	0	a	and you got on the and on the
73839	0	a	Yeah .
73840	0	a	Well
73841	0	a	you need some kind of CPU , I guess .
73842	0	a	I suppose so .
73843	0	a	, I do not I dunno
73844	0	a	I do not think that is
73845	0	a	Yeah
73846	0	a	yeah
73847	0	a	okay
73848	0	a	but I d
73849	0	a	I
73850	0	a	I do not know if nor o s it is quite a simple LCD .
73851	0	a	It is a simple CPU
73852	0	a	but it does not
73853	0	a	Yeah
73854	0	a	because it has to b
73855	0	a	Yeah
73856	0	a	but it the the remote control has to know whether you are in a settings menu or just you just want to turn up the volume .
73857	0	a	Yeah , it is quite a simple LCD screen .
73858	0	a	I think they do not need that big of CPU .
73859	0	a	Yeah , okay , true true .
73860	0	a	True .
73861	0	a	So it has to have some kind of a calculation unit or CPU to know in which state you are and which button you are pressing in at the right moment .
73862	0	a	Because we are projecting projecting the buttons on the LCD screen .
73863	0	a	Yeah .
73864	0	a	And a touch screen makes it possible to to get the co ordination of your finger on the screen .
73865	0	a	Yeah .
73866	0	a	And the case , yeah we already discussed the case , we wanted to make it from rubber
73867	0	a	and
73868	0	a	hard rubber I think .
73869	0	a	It is rubber .
73870	0	a	Yeah
73871	0	a	but but a hard rubber like this ?
73872	0	a	Or softer rubber
73873	0	a	or
73874	0	a	Yeah .
73875	0	a	That is the easy to ha to to
73876	0	a	Yeah .
73877	0	a	Yeah .
73878	0	a	It bounces back from the floor where you throw it .
73879	0	a	Yeah sure ,
73880	0	a	look .
73881	0	a	We have different colours .
73882	0	a	Yeah yeah
73883	0	a	this in different colours ?
73884	0	a	Yeah it is a bit .
73885	0	a	So
73886	0	a	the shapes is something between the square shapes with round colo corners and a round shapes ?
73887	0	a	No I do not think ,
73888	0	a	I think it is more round than square .
73889	0	a	D
73890	0	a	It is our main target .
73891	1	a	But I think it should be a bit longer , perhaps .
73892	0	a	So it meets
73893	0	a	I think it meets more the young people than the older people .
73894	0	a	Yeah .
73895	0	a	Yeah .
73896	0	a	But that is what we want , .
73897	0	a	I think so too .
73898	0	a	Yeah , that is our target .
73899	0	a	Yeah .
73900	0	a	Yeah .
73901	0	a	Lower than forty years , I think it was .
73902	0	a	Well
73903	0	a	and how about my idea of making it with one single curve ?
73904	0	a	So i
73905	0	a	Because it is a gadget and you want to show it off , of course .
73906	0	a	Oh yeah
73907	0	a	that that I think
73908	0	a	I thought that was a quite good
73909	0	a	Yeah .
73910	0	a	Yeah .
73911	0	a	Yeah
73912	0	a	yeah you have a fancy design , then , right away .
73913	0	a	Yeah .
73914	1	a	You can put it on your table with the LCD screen , you do not have to put it get it in your hand , you can put it next to you and then dive it in
73915	0	a	and .
73916	0	a	So
73917	0	a	Okay so
73918	0	a	Yeah
73919	0	a	but I wrote it down .
73920	0	a	Because it
73921	0	a	Yeah .
73922	0	a	Yeah .
73923	0	a	Yeah , that is a good idea .
73924	0	a	It is a lot easier .
73925	0	a	Yeah .
73926	0	a	Yeah , alright .
73927	0	a	So
73928	0	a	You ca not you You ca not
73929	0	a	oh ,
73930	1	a	you c you can draw it on your paper and then load it on the And load it on the the user the server .
73931	0	a	So , so
73932	0	a	you got
73933	0	a	Did you write that down ?
73934	0	a	got a single curved rubber f fancy coloured remote control .
73935	0	a	And then
73936	0	a	Yeah , you can It is pretty easy
73937	0	a	but And
73938	0	a	Yeah ,
73939	0	a	I had what I just
73940	1	a	I should again .
73941	0	a	Yeah .
73942	1	a	What about the user interface ,
73943	0	a	there are also some some questions about the concepts I think you have some ideas on that .
73944	0	a	You you showed your drawing .
73945	0	a	I miss a few buttons ,
73946	0	a	but .
73947	0	a	Well .
73948	0	a	At least
73949	1	a	what we should also have on , I just remembered , a menu to go back through the first
73950	0	a	if if you touch options , you ca not go back to this right away now .
73951	0	a	Yeah ,
73952	0	a	you have to go back .
73953	0	a	Yeah .
73954	0	a	This
73955	0	a	I do not know .
73956	0	a	Is not it better to have the sound and the general buttons horizontal ?
73957	0	a	With the minus and the plus .
73958	0	a	I think it is
73959	0	a	I do not know .
73960	0	a	I think it is easier than
73961	0	a	Yeah .
73962	0	a	I I thought it was easier to handle this way ,
73963	0	a	but I do not know what they think .
73964	0	a	Sorry ?
73965	0	a	Depends on the screen .
73966	0	a	Would you like the the buttons horizontal or v vertical ?
73967	0	a	Th
73968	0	a	Right well
73969	0	a	if we make it like this , I think if you
73970	1	a	put it like this
73971	0	a	Yeah .
73972	0	a	For sound and channel .
73973	0	a	If you make the screen vertical it does not matter .
73974	0	a	If you make it in a rectangle
73975	0	a	I
73976	0	a	so it is it is
73977	0	a	it is
73978	0	a	it is
73979	0	a	Square .
73980	0	a	Yeah .
73981	0	a	I think it is it is easier to have it
73982	0	a	something like Oh a button minus here , plus over here .
73983	0	a	A minus here , plus over here .
73984	0	a	Oh , okay .
73985	0	a	And on here .
73986	1	a	The other buttons and on here the top .
73987	1	a	The options and then you have something like the P over here , and the sound .
73988	0	a	Yeah .
73989	0	a	But I think I wou
73990	0	a	I think that is a matter of what you are used to .
73991	0	a	Something
73992	1	a	Something like
73993	0	a	Sh
73994	1	a	Plus minus plus minus .
73995	0	a	I think I would put a plus and a min here .
73996	0	a	And then the P in the mid in the middle and the sound in the middle .
73997	0	a	Take your time .
73998	0	a	Almost .
73999	0	a	Yeah
74000	0	a	but I think when you are holding it , you could press the minus and the plus and with the other finger the minus and the plus .
74001	0	a	Yeah
74002	0	a	I think you are going to s
74003	0	a	you are going to use it with one thumb .
74004	0	a	Yeah
74005	0	a	but I think
74006	0	a	Yeah
74007	0	a	I do not know .
74008	0	a	Perhaps I have some examples .
74009	0	a	W
74010	1	a	We will leave that to the usability engineering then .
74011	0	a	I do not know
74012	0	a	That is me .
74013	0	a	Who is the usability engineering ?
74014	0	a	She is .
74015	1	a	But I am going to look if I have got some examples
74016	1	a	cause perhaps you should choose what is most often used .
74017	0	a	Oh .
74018	0	a	The
74019	0	a	Cause they can use that better .
74020	0	a	Yeah .
74021	0	a	Oh
74022	0	a	I have that those s numbers .
74023	0	a	Consistency .
74024	0	a	Yeah .
74025	0	a	I Here is our here are
74026	0	a	I do not really know .
74027	0	a	Or a good watch .
74028	0	a	B
74029	0	a	Channel selection .
74030	0	a	Everybody is searching in his data .
74031	0	a	Yeah .
74032	0	a	Per hour one hundred and sixty eight .
74033	0	a	Volume selection four times an hour
74034	0	a	Yeah ,
74035	0	a	that depends on on on the remote .
74036	0	a	Yeah
74037	0	a	but But I mean if it is usually plus or min above each other or next to each other on a normal remote .
74038	0	a	Yeah .
74039	0	a	So not how much n not how often it is used , but
74040	0	a	W what is what is usual or normal .
74041	0	a	Yes
74042	0	a	I am looking here .
74043	0	a	But here is it is below , here also , and now here is here is next to each other .
74044	0	a	I think it is it is a
74045	0	a	Yeah .
74046	0	a	I think
74047	0	a	because I have two televisions at home .
74048	0	a	One is horizontal , one is vertical , so it depends .
74049	0	a	Yeah
74050	0	a	it does it does not really matter ,
74051	0	a	but
74052	0	a	Yeah .
74053	0	a	Depends .
74054	0	a	I think the the the volume was usually above each other , because you go higher and down .
74055	0	a	Yeah , lower .
74056	0	a	And the the pay the the
74057	0	a	the program is next to each other , because you would go further and back .
74058	0	a	True .
74059	0	a	That is how it is is usually when I look here that is what I see .
74060	0	a	Okay , .
74061	1	a	Let is cut to the chase .
74062	0	a	It is got to change .
74063	0	a	Yeah well
74064	1	a	I think we have we do not have to decide about that now
74065	0	a	how
74066	1	a	where we will put the buttons
74067	0	a	just the
74068	0	a	concepts .
74069	1	a	I do not know .
74070	0	a	Yeah is it is user interface .
74071	0	a	Yeah .
74072	0	a	Component .
74073	0	a	This concept is in the actual design ,
74074	1	a	but you should know where you would place a
74075	0	a	And the speech shall we implement that ?
74076	0	a	Or
74077	0	a	Yeah .
74078	0	a	Okay , well
74079	0	a	le
74080	0	a	Yeah .
74081	0	a	Interface , yeah .
74082	0	a	Yeah well
74083	0	a	we just heard about the new technology , huh ?
74084	0	a	Yeah I think it is it is easy for that ,
74085	0	a	where are you , but then it says I am here .
74086	0	a	Technologies , .
74087	0	a	Yeah .
74088	0	a	Makes it possible to
74089	1	a	But then you should also find a place You could if you do it like this
74090	1	a	you could put it in a corner or something .
74091	0	a	Yeah .
74092	1	a	You can talk into the corner .
74093	0	a	Yeah , a microphone , yeah .
74094	0	a	Not even necessary ,
74095	0	a	because a lotta
74096	1	a	you can make a very sensitive microphone ,
74097	0	a	so it makes it possible to just put it arou underneath it or on the on the bottom of the remote .
74098	0	a	Yeah .
74099	0	a	Yeah
74100	1	a	maybe at the bottom where you can can hel hold it with you hand that there is also a microphone over there .
74101	0	a	But
74102	0	a	Yeah , that is also .
74103	0	a	Yeah .
74104	0	a	Right .
74105	0	a	So ,
74106	0	a	in the middle or something .
74107	0	a	But that is not import
74108	0	a	I think that is not im very important
74109	0	a	because yeah ,
74110	0	a	it does not matter where the microphone is .
74111	0	a	Yeah ,
74112	0	a	yeah .
74113	1	a	but you should decide where you want to put it .
74114	0	a	okay , sure , okay ,
74115	0	a	well
74116	0	a	tha
74117	0	a	Underneath ?
74118	0	a	Indeed .
74119	0	a	Right ?
74120	1	a	You could p you could put it in a logo of the company .
74121	1	a	I think where it is not seen the most .
74122	0	a	It should not be very visible .
74123	1	a	Inside .
74124	0	a	Yeah .
74125	0	a	Yeah sure
74126	0	a	, why no
74127	0	a	Yeah
74128	0	a	but it does not makes it any more fancy because you get to see
74129	0	a	Yeah .
74130	0	a	Well
74131	1	a	maybe just in the the spot you just pointed out
74132	0	a	because I think it should be in a in an important position where people can see it ,
74133	0	a	because it is the the unique idea of our remote , huh , the the speech control .
74134	0	a	I i
74135	1	a	between the round of the R .
74136	0	a	Yeah .
74137	0	a	Yeah .
74138	0	a	Yeah .
74139	0	a	Yeah , okay .
74140	0	a	So
74141	1	a	where do you want to put it ?
74142	0	a	Yeah
74143	0	a	actually it does
74144	0	a	because it you can you can find it better if you use it .
74145	0	a	Well
74146	0	a	maybe where the one hand
74147	0	a	But are we talking about the button , or about the microphone ?
74148	0	a	Yeah
74149	0	a	because a microphone is very small thing , but you can make it look like it is big so as its its really an important function of the remote .
74150	0	a	Yeah .
74151	0	a	Yeah
74152	0	a	bu but
74153	1	a	I think the left s under corner should be the best .
74154	0	a	It is a way for you to
74155	0	a	So it makes more sense
74156	0	a	just cause other remotes do not have that .
74157	0	a	Yeah , okay .
74158	0	a	About a microphone , there is no button .
74159	0	a	Yeah .
74160	1	a	Where is not i it is not most in sight .
74161	0	a	Yeah .
74162	0	a	Okay .
74163	0	a	I think .
74164	0	a	Well put it there .
74165	0	a	I do not mind .
74166	0	a	That does not does not really matter .
74167	0	a	No .
74168	0	a	Actually does not .
74169	0	a	Okay .
74170	0	a	Alright .
74171	0	a	So ?
74172	0	a	Interface type .
74173	0	a	Any more
74174	0	a	Yeah .
74175	0	a	So well
74176	0	a	type , supplements , anything .
74177	0	a	Yeah , well
74178	0	a	we already s discussed that , huh , the the LCD
74179	0	a	and
74180	0	a	The LCD
74181	0	a	yeah ,
74182	0	a	supplements well the supplement is to
74183	0	a	yeah .
74184	0	a	I think I thought the , like you said , like scroll next to the remote is not that handy .
74185	0	a	Yeah .
74186	1	a	I think it is better to just up what you would like to do on the screen .
74187	1	a	If you want to go back you have to back button go back ,
74188	1	a	if you want to choose audio settings you press audio settings
74189	1	a	and it goes to that
74190	1	a	s
74191	1	a	sub menu .
74192	0	a	Yeah .
74193	0	a	Hey ,
74194	0	a	yeah .
74195	0	a	Yeah
74196	0	a	the the young people do like scroll
74197	0	a	Use the scroll .
74198	0	a	Yeah ?
74199	0	a	You do like it ?
74200	0	a	Yeah I think it is is faster .
74201	0	a	Yeah I think so too .
74202	1	a	So why not , on on side .
74203	0	a	Or at least
74204	0	a	Yeah
74205	0	a	I do not know if it is really the scroll ,
74206	0	a	but the menu they like most , and I think you can never get through a menu great with a scroll
74207	0	a	But you have it is f
74208	0	a	we have five or four or something .
74209	0	a	Fast ,
74210	0	a	yeah .
74211	0	a	So
74212	0	a	if you have got a settings , if you
74213	0	a	Yes .
74214	0	a	Becau
74215	0	a	I think the scroll is easier if you have a lot of options , but if you do not have a lot of option then
74216	0	a	Y
74217	0	a	Uh huh .
74218	0	a	You have a lot of options ,
74219	0	a	because when you use
74220	0	a	Yeah
74221	0	a	you get w when you use the settings menu for example to look up some some channels on your on your television , you should scroll scroll down on a menu which probably does not fit on your screen .
74222	0	a	Yeah , okay , true .
74223	0	a	Yeah .
74224	0	a	So then it is very handy to to scroll down ,
74225	1	a	you make just a rubber just like on your mouse or .
74226	0	a	Okay .
74227	1	a	Just put it on the side and it is very easy to use .
74228	0	a	Okay , no problem .
74229	0	a	And I think I would it would make even more fancy because you have another interesting thing on the side
74230	0	a	which you can touch
74231	0	a	and
74232	0	a	Yeah .
74233	0	a	Yeah ,
74234	0	a	yeah .
74235	0	a	Yeah .
74236	0	a	It is also different .
74237	0	a	Yeah .
74238	0	a	Okay .
74239	0	a	Okay .
74240	0	a	Well
74241	0	a	there is our five minutes warning .
74242	0	a	any more questions about about the design or the user interface or different components , everyone ?
74243	0	a	Everybody think they can can work for that ?
74244	0	a	Is there a standard colour ?
74245	0	a	Yeah .
74246	0	a	No , colours are clear , shape is clear , material is clear .
74247	0	a	Okay ,
74248	0	a	what is the standard colour ?
74249	0	a	I I
74250	0	a	You got you got different colours ,
74251	1	a	but you should have a standard colour .
74252	0	a	And a standard ,
74253	0	a	yeah
74254	0	a	we do not
74255	0	a	no we have different colour .
74256	1	a	How many colours are we going to
74257	0	a	Black .
74258	1	a	You should you should have a black one
74259	0	a	because I think black is standard .
74260	0	a	Yeah , black I think is is the standard .
74261	0	a	Black ?
74262	0	a	With the with the yellow
74263	0	a	Just a regular remote colour .
74264	0	a	But if you want to be different , then
74265	0	a	Silver .
74266	1	a	Dark grey , something like this this colour or something .
74267	0	a	Yeah like like
74268	0	a	yeah .
74269	0	a	And then have different covers to use .
74270	1	a	Or or silver .
74271	0	a	I think it is better to have silver nowadays .
74272	0	a	Silver , yeah .
74273	0	a	I think you see more silver than black .
74274	0	a	You see a lot of t silver televisions .
74275	0	a	But still silver and black are
74276	0	a	well
74277	0	a	silver is new but also traditional ,
74278	0	a	so
74279	0	a	Yeah
74280	0	a	w what about a yellow thing ,
74281	0	a	I mean it
74282	0	a	could be ugly , but it is definitely fancy .
74283	1	a	Silver rubber .
74284	0	a	Yeah the the silver black are our main colours .
74285	0	a	Yeah .
74286	0	a	I think we have silver , black
74287	1	a	and between those is like I
74288	1	a	dunno s five colours between them or something .
74289	0	a	Yeah
74290	0	a	y I think it is better to
74291	0	a	Yeah th
74292	0	a	yeah .
74293	0	a	Yeah
74294	0	a	yeah yeah
74295	1	a	it will be a banana yellow , we have .
74296	1	a	R red .
74297	0	a	But
74298	0	a	yeah .
74299	0	a	That is right .
74300	1	a	Green , wood , brown .
74301	0	a	But if you use silver , rubber s silver rubber is not fancy .
74302	0	a	Yeah .
74303	0	a	True .
74304	0	a	When you use titanium , silver is fancy , but when you use silver rubber , it is not fancy .
74305	0	a	Yeah .
74306	0	a	Silver has to shine , and rubber does not shine .
74307	0	a	Especially when it is made of soft rubber like this .
74308	0	a	Yeah .
74309	0	a	You understand ?
74310	0	a	Yeah .
74311	0	a	Yeah , I understand .
74312	0	a	Yeah
74313	1	a	I would think about colours like red , yellow , green , blue ,
74314	0	a	just
74315	0	a	Yeah .
74316	0	a	Yeah o of course .
74317	1	a	The fruity colours and the autumn colours , like red and brown , dark red and brown .
74318	0	a	Fruity .
74319	1	a	Just all kind of colour .
74320	0	a	Fruity loops .
74321	1	a	Maroon .
74322	0	a	Yeah .
74323	0	a	Yeah .
74324	0	a	Okay .
74325	0	a	Okay , so
74326	0	a	Who is pinging ?
74327	0	a	You are pingin
74328	0	a	Okay .
74329	0	a	And and do we have to have a normal black one , or
74330	0	a	Is it
74331	0	a	Yeah .
74332	0	a	No .
74333	0	a	You ping .
74334	0	a	I thought we
74335	0	a	Okay , so
74336	0	a	that wraps it up ?
74337	0	a	Everybody knows what to do ?
74338	0	a	Well
74339	0	a	I wrote it down here .
74340	0	a	Well
74341	0	a	not what to do .

74343	0	a	I do not know what to do ,
74344	0	a	but .
74345	0	a	I wrote it down here what to do .
74346	0	a	Not what to do .
74347	0	a	The next meeting is once again in thirty minutes .
74348	0	a	Okay .
74349	0	a	here are the individual actions , and especially notice that the Industrial Designer and the User Interface Designer are going to work together on a prototype drawing on a smart board , and of course to all four of us specific instructions will be emailed by our personal coach .
74350	0	a	Ooh .
74351	0	a	Right .
74352	0	a	S
74353	0	a	tough .
74354	0	a	Yeah .

74359	0	a	or do we
74360	0	a	Right .
74361	0	a	Well
74362	1	a	I I would say just wait for email and find out .

74384	0	a	Yeah .
74385	0	a	So well
74386	0	a	welcome everyone .
74387	0	a	as you may have noticed I created separate folders because it was tending to get a little busy in our shared project documents folder .
74388	0	a	Yeah .
74389	0	a	I do not know if everybody put their own documents in the right folder ,
74390	0	a	which is for now the detailed design meeting .
74391	0	a	That is new one ?
74392	0	a	Yep .
74393	0	a	We did not make any
74394	0	a	Oh
74395	0	a	in
74396	0	a	Did not we just do that ?
74397	0	a	Oh .
74398	0	a	Yeah .
74399	1	a	we should save that one .
74400	1	a	Then I will move this one .
74401	0	a	Yeah ,
74402	1	a	save in the folder .
74403	1	a	Save as project .
74404	0	a	Oh
74405	0	a	no ,
74406	0	a	this is just one big document ,
74407	1	a	so you can leave that wherever it is .
74408	0	a	Oh ,
74409	0	a	okay .
74410	0	a	And we have a evaluation left here .
74411	0	a	Okay .
74412	0	a	Agenda .
74413	0	a	Well
74414	0	a	not main documents this time .
74415	0	a	We could .
74416	0	a	Oh yes .
74417	0	a	I have it open myself I guess .
74418	0	a	well
74419	0	a	the detailed design meeting Huh ?
74420	0	a	We are finally getting somewhere hopefully .
74421	0	a	what are we going to do ?
74422	0	a	I have opened it already .
74423	0	a	I am still going to take some minutes ,
74424	0	a	and if I am right , you two are going to give a prototype presentation ?
74425	0	a	Are not you ?
74426	0	a	Yes , you are .
74427	0	a	Oh , sorry .
74428	0	a	And m did you do something with evaluation criteria ?
74429	0	a	Good .
74430	0	a	Yep .
74431	0	a	And we have a correct agenda .
74432	0	a	And then we have to look at something which is less nice ,
74433	0	a	the finance aspect , whether we can afford what we have designed , and if we can we can commence the final part which is the production or project evaluation ,
74434	0	a	how did we work together
74435	0	a	and what are the results ,
74436	0	a	and how happy are we with those .
74437	0	a	Oops .
74438	0	a	Okay , well
74439	0	a	finance will be later .
74440	1	a	Now I would like to give the word to you two .
74441	0	a	Yeah .
74442	0	a	Okay .
74443	0	a	Get up stand up .
74444	0	a	Well
74445	0	a	we made a prototype .
74446	0	a	just
74447	0	a	Kay .
74448	0	a	We first start with the overall
74449	0	a	This is about the total remote control .
74450	0	a	View .
74451	0	a	We made it green .
74452	0	a	Just example colour ,
74453	0	a	so
74454	1	a	there is one of the colours we would like to see in our prototype .
74455	0	a	Yeah .
74456	0	a	It is a fresh colour .
74457	0	a	And the screen light blue .
74458	0	a	Oh
74459	0	a	this the scroll button and the microphone on the on the sides here under .
74460	0	a	And the R and R logo , it just says R and R now ,
74461	0	a	but
74462	0	a	Any questions so far ?
74463	0	a	Yeah .
74464	0	a	Okay ?
74465	0	a	yeah ,
74466	0	a	just just an idea about how to m th that could also be possible .
74467	0	a	Big microphone .
74468	0	a	Oh okay .
74469	0	a	That is the place where it is going to be , not the size .
74470	0	a	well ,
74471	0	a	it is an idea
74472	0	a	in a so .
74473	0	a	Yeah .
74474	0	a	Oh
74475	0	a	y you
74476	1	a	perhaps you should make it a bit big ,
74477	0	a	so people know it is there
74478	0	a	and
74479	0	a	Do not forget it .
74480	0	a	To function it it does not really have to be sm big of course .
74481	0	a	Yeah , okay .
74482	0	a	The microphone could be just a minor hole on the left button .
74483	0	a	Of course .
74484	0	a	, th
74485	0	a	yeah .
74486	0	a	Small .
74487	0	a	Okay
74488	0	a	we also made some ideas about how the options menu would work .
74489	0	a	using the scroll button on sides y
74490	0	a	I
74491	0	a	Yeah , you push the scroll button
74492	1	a	and a drop down menu or a pull out menu comes out and you get you get the options becoming available .
74493	1	a	You push the scroll button and it is claps out
74494	0	a	if there is a
74495	1	a	Remote settings , et cetera .
74496	1	a	For example TV settings , remote settings , et cetera .
74497	0	a	Yeah .
74498	1	a	So you can scroll down too with the scroll button ,
74499	0	a	as you can see
74500	0	a	oh ,
74501	0	a	it is here ,
74502	1	a	just push it in , the menu comes out like this
74503	1	a	and i it all becomes visible .
74504	0	a	Yeah .
74505	0	a	Yeah ,
74506	0	a	that is c
74507	0	a	Yeah .
74508	1	a	And you could also touch it
74509	0	a	so that it comes out ,
74510	1	a	and and use the the the scroll thing as a with your fingers .
74511	0	a	Indeed .
74512	0	a	Yes .
74513	0	a	Okay ,
74514	0	a	it is also nice to see that we made a small menu , the options menu becoming available when pressing the scroll button ,
74515	1	a	and the opportunity to use the teletext ,
74516	0	a	whi which is used which should still be used
74517	1	a	and we think that it is very handy to put it not under the options menu , but in Yes .
74518	1	a	In an apart
74519	0	a	In a separate button ,
74520	0	a	yeah .
74521	0	a	Yeah .
74522	0	a	So
74523	0	a	a separate button for for text ,
74524	0	a	okay .
74525	0	a	Yeah .
74526	1	a	Perhaps we should use the teletext sign
74527	0	a	in p yeah .
74528	0	a	A sign , yeah ,
74529	0	a	just like
74530	0	a	Okay , indeed .
74531	0	a	Yeah .
74532	0	a	Okay ,
74533	1	a	we can modify that later .
74534	0	a	Forgot .
74535	0	a	Okay .
74536	1	a	Would you like to make any comments about next
74537	0	a	Previous page , yeah , indeed .
74538	0	a	well ,
74539	0	a	this is the total interface that f of the LCD screen .
74540	0	a	the numbers , which is pretty straight forward .
74541	1	a	We put ano an an extra button in .
74542	0	a	We can erase it , but It is the button where you can switch channels .
74543	1	a	just when you are one and you go to two , you can or
74544	1	a	if you go to five , you can go back to one with that button .
74545	0	a	Yeah , that one , yeah .
74546	0	a	It has a name .
74547	1	a	And we put that in ,
74548	0	a	I thought it would be handy there .
74549	0	a	Oh my God .
74550	0	a	this the one number or two numbers button .
74551	0	a	Below that , the page and the sound .
74552	0	a	And in the middle the the mute .
74553	0	a	battery indicator .
74554	0	a	It is it is a bit big .
74555	0	a	It is quite large .
74556	0	a	And this is the the on off knop , the stand by knop .
74557	1	a	Or at least it should look like it .
74558	0	a	And the options of teletext .
74559	0	a	Okay .
74560	0	a	You can see very clearly now that the teletext and options menu is not taking much it is taking much part of the screen ,
74561	0	a	so it is very
74562	0	a	when you when you use it , does not become irritating to see .
74563	0	a	Cause if you put it on the top you always get see the the options menu .
74564	0	a	Huh .
74565	0	a	Cause people regularly read from left top to right down ,
74566	0	a	so
74567	0	a	Okay .
74568	0	a	Yeah .
74569	0	a	Well
74570	0	a	this about it , I think .
74571	0	a	Yeah .
74572	0	a	Huh .
74573	0	a	Thank you .
74574	1	a	I will put it back on the on the nice green .
74575	0	a	Looks good .
74576	0	a	And I just missed when I was typing
74577	0	a	The RR stands for ?
74578	0	a	Logo , okay .
74579	0	a	That is the logo of the
74580	0	a	Yeah .
74581	0	a	It is th th right now it is only R R , but
74582	0	a	Yeah .
74583	0	a	Okay well
74584	0	a	I would have recognised it if it were the right colours of course .
74585	1	a	Full screen .
74586	0	a	Shit .
74587	0	a	Alright .
74588	0	a	Sorry .
74589	0	a	Kay .
74590	0	a	Okay ,
74591	1	a	the evaluation criteria ,
74592	0	a	huh ?
74593	0	a	Well
74594	0	a	it is looks fancy , especially with the green colour .
74595	0	a	Oh full screen , yeah .
74596	0	a	Huh .
74597	0	a	Evaluation .
74598	0	a	Kay ,
74599	0	a	my task was this time to put up a questionnaire by which we can evaluate the design of the remote control by the questions we requirements from the of the users .
74600	0	a	My name , my job ,
74601	0	a	okay .
74602	0	a	My name , my job .
74603	0	a	The methods .
74604	0	a	Questionnaire with seven point scale from one to seven , from true to false , like question , is remote big enough , we can say it is true or it is false by steps .
74605	0	a	Right .
74606	0	a	One means absolutely not true , seven means true .
74607	0	a	Yeah .
74608	0	a	The three important things of refa are from th of this year is are ,
74609	0	a	is the remote control fancy enough , is it in innovative enough , and is it easy enough to use .
74610	0	a	Sorry ,
74611	0	a	you used the PowerPoint
74612	0	a	What ?
74613	0	a	Bling .
74614	0	a	Yeah .
74615	0	a	And then evaluation itself .
74616	0	a	So .
74617	0	a	Okay .
74618	0	a	Yeah .
74619	0	a	First question .
74620	0	a	Is the design fancy enough ?
74621	0	a	Project Manager , what do you think ?
74622	0	a	But does it
74623	0	a	Yeah .
74624	0	a	Well
74625	0	a	Yeah .
74626	0	a	And the the curves which we decided ,
74627	0	a	huh ?
74628	0	a	Only what happened to the single curve we spoke about last meeting ?
74629	0	a	Well
74630	0	a	it might work one time , huh .
74631	0	a	Now
74632	0	a	the single curved idea was
74633	0	a	Yeah , okay ,
74634	0	a	you ge
74635	0	a	Yeah .
74636	0	a	It oh it is in the background .
74637	0	a	Oh .
74638	1	a	Y you should make a sideways view .
74639	0	a	The sideways view ,
74640	0	a	that that that ma
74641	0	a	Ho
74642	1	a	not that pen .
74643	0	a	It will be , I guess .
74644	0	a	Oh , we can
74645	0	a	Oh
74646	0	a	g I would smart board .
74647	1	a	Not that pen .
74648	0	a	can I draw here or
74649	0	a	Ooh .
74650	0	a	Suppose so .
74651	0	a	Think .
74652	0	a	Yeah ,
74653	0	a	yeah , you can .
74654	0	a	Oh my God ,
74655	0	a	it works .
74656	0	a	So
74657	0	a	it would be something like this from the side , but with a bit of curve here ,
74658	0	a	right ?
74659	0	a	Yeah .
74660	0	a	Yeah , that is the single curve indeed .
74661	0	a	So
74662	0	a	if you v flip it like this .
74663	0	a	Yep .
74664	0	a	Okay .
74665	0	a	Here is yeah .
74666	0	a	That is not very i
74667	1	a	it is also very handy if you make a side curve way to make the the remote control very thin at the bottom at a bottom at a bottom .
74668	1	a	make it rather thick on the top ,
74669	0	a	because on the top it has the screen , which takes in some space ,
74670	1	a	and the batteries can be located over there ,
74671	0	a	so
74672	0	a	Yeah .
74673	0	a	Yeah .
74674	0	a	So
74675	1	a	you just make the back of this part a bit bigger ,
74676	0	a	so that it lays a bit o
74677	0	a	Yeah , that is a bit of problem maybe .
74678	0	a	Is not going to be a little bit heavy at the top ?
74679	0	a	With two batteries , the whole print plate and t and top , and if you are holding it quite a lot I think
74680	0	a	Yeah .
74681	0	a	No .
74682	0	a	Yeah .
74683	1	a	I think yeah , the battery should be in here ,
74684	0	a	because it is just nothing ,
74685	0	a	so if you could
74686	0	a	Yeah .
74687	0	a	Yeah .
74688	0	a	Okay , indeed .
74689	0	a	Yeah .
74690	0	a	Cause otherwise I think i
74691	0	a	I think it does .
74692	0	a	Okay ,
74693	0	a	but we have to rate these things now ?
74694	0	a	Okay .
74695	0	a	Yeah , we have to rate .
74696	0	a	Is it fancy enough ?
74697	0	a	True is one , false is seven .
74698	0	a	So
74699	0	a	fancy enough means , does it comes to the younger people and the elder people .
74700	0	a	I think so .
74701	0	a	I think
74702	0	a	Yeah , I have to agree , all the colour colours don don does not matter that m that much now , it is only design .
74703	0	a	I if you do not make it green , then the elder people wo not wo not like it .
74704	0	a	It is pretty fancy .
74705	0	a	Yeah .
74706	0	a	you get th
74707	0	a	Yeah .
74708	0	a	I think it does .
74709	0	a	Yeah .
74710	0	a	And the design .
74711	0	a	Well
74712	0	a	I think especially because of the microphone and the LCD screen also .
74713	0	a	Yeah .
74714	0	a	I do not know whether older people will use it , but I would make it a two or something .
74715	0	a	Very new thing .
74716	0	a	Well
74717	0	a	Fancy the old people will .
74718	0	a	So
74719	0	a	A two ?
74720	0	a	Yeah ,
74721	0	a	I n used I wouldn I should use that one , but it does not
74722	0	a	Okay , no
74723	0	a	it is two ?
74724	0	a	True is a one .
74725	0	a	Yeah .
74726	0	a	Huh ?
74727	0	a	Alright , it is a one .
74728	0	a	It is true , it is a one .
74729	0	a	Very fancy .
74730	0	a	Oh it is a one .
74731	0	a	No , it is a two .
74732	0	a	Little bit strange we have to judge that ourselves ,
74733	0	a	huh ?
74734	0	a	Well
74735	0	a	I would say two on a scale
74736	0	a	No ,
74737	0	a	okay well ,
74738	0	a	that is true .
74739	0	a	Yeah .
74740	0	a	But it is a one
74741	0	a	Maybe
74742	0	a	Yeah .
74743	0	a	Very true , is it very true or is not that true ?
74744	0	a	Yeah , I think two .
74745	0	a	Well
74746	0	a	they think it is very true ,
74747	0	a	but
74748	0	a	Yeah ,
74749	0	a	but We should perhaps That not .
74750	0	a	It is very true ,
74751	0	a	because we designed it to be very fancy ,
74752	0	a	so
74753	0	a	It is very fancy , I think .
74754	0	a	Have you ever seen a remote control like this ?
74755	0	a	No , okay ,
74756	0	a	so so it is fancy .
74757	0	a	That is fancy enough .
74758	0	a	Yeah .
74759	0	a	Then ?
74760	0	a	Okay .
74761	0	a	Okay , one two .
74762	0	a	That does not matter that much ,
74763	1	a	so make it a one .
74764	0	a	Yeah .
74765	0	a	Let is give it a two .
74766	0	a	Is it innovative ?
74767	0	a	Enough .
74768	0	a	I think it is ,
74769	0	a	because it has an LCD screen , a mi microphone .
74770	0	a	Yeah
74771	0	a	m
74772	0	a	Yeah ,
74773	0	a	and you use these buttons the most ,
74774	0	a	huh ?
74775	0	a	So
74776	0	a	So
74777	0	a	which
74778	0	a	So
74779	0	a	which number are we going to fill in ?
74780	0	a	A two , yeah ?
74781	0	a	Two , three and
74782	0	a	what do you think ?
74783	0	a	Okay , so
74784	0	a	we have two , two , three .
74785	0	a	And the scroll is rubber ,
74786	0	a	so s Eno enough to I think .
74787	0	a	We have for the search function .
74788	0	a	It is from rubber .
74789	0	a	Yeah .
74790	0	a	The scroller a bit
74791	0	a	I think it is it is a one
74792	0	a	yeah .
74793	0	a	It is a one I think .
74794	0	a	True .
74795	0	a	Also huh uh huh the buttons , are they easy to find ?
74796	0	a	That was a big requirement of the old people .
74797	0	a	Yeah ,
74798	0	a	because they are right on your screen .
74799	0	a	So you can use the b the the arrows .
74800	0	a	Huh .
74801	0	a	They are right on your screen , so I do not know where you would search .
74802	0	a	With the ones
74803	0	a	Yeah .
74804	0	a	Are all the buttons easy to find ?
74805	0	a	Not only this buttons , all the buttons .
74806	0	a	Yeah .
74807	0	a	Well ,
74808	0	a	I think they are .
74809	0	a	The options are it little bit harder ,
74810	0	a	but if you touch the options then it is
74811	0	a	No they are not , but they are
74812	0	a	they are they are easy to find .
74813	0	a	Take a harder look ,
74814	0	a	yeah , sure .
74815	0	a	I think th it is easy t
74816	0	a	Yeah , I think this is easy now .
74817	0	a	It is easier than the regular remote control .
74818	0	a	I think th I think the options buttons are not the the easiest way to to to handle .
74819	0	a	Yeah .
74820	0	a	True .
74821	0	a	I would rate it a
74822	0	a	Yeah , okay , that is true , that is true .
74823	0	a	Yeah , they are a lot easier to find than th than on the regular remote controls
74824	0	a	where you have to find out what which sign or icon means on every button .
74825	0	a	Oh .
74826	0	a	Yeah .
74827	0	a	So you have t you have to use the the the manual to understand most
74828	0	a	Yeah .
74829	0	a	But that is that is vantage of LCD screen ,
74830	0	a	you can have text .
74831	0	a	I would say yeah .
74832	0	a	I think it is it is a two , at least .
74833	0	a	Yeah .
74834	0	a	Yeah , you can make it a two .
74835	0	a	Yeah .
74836	0	a	It is not perfect , but
74837	0	a	A three ?
74838	0	a	And why is that ?
74839	0	a	It said bo both the options .
74840	0	a	I think it is a three .
74841	0	a	I personally think , because I d I do not think i maybe it is easy to use ,
74842	0	a	it has to be easy to find right away .
74843	0	a	I I think if you have the button at the right , I do not think you can find the option button that easy .
74844	0	a	Yeah ,
74845	0	a	but you do not have t have to use the button on the right .
74846	0	a	You can touch it .
74847	0	a	You can touch it .
74848	0	a	Yeah .
74849	0	a	You you can touch options .
74850	0	a	Yeah , okay ,
74851	0	a	but you have y
74852	0	a	then you have here
74853	0	a	s written option on here , the teletext button ,
74854	0	a	right ?
74855	0	a	Okay , then okay , good .
74856	0	a	Yeah .
74857	0	a	Yeah .
74858	0	a	Then I think also two , yeah .
74859	0	a	You can touch options and it is comes out .
74860	0	a	A two , okay ,
74861	0	a	because we have to
74862	1	a	It is the box below it ,
74863	0	a	huh ?
74864	0	a	Otherwise we have two results in one question .
74865	0	a	Yep .
74866	0	a	A two , a two .
74867	1	a	The the Below .
74868	1	a	the next question the next question .
74869	0	a	Oh my God .
74870	0	a	It is different .
74871	0	a	Okay ,
74872	1	a	next question .
74873	0	a	It is easy to use , as well for younger as elderl elderly people .
74874	0	a	For young people I think it is easy to use .
74875	0	a	Young means sixteen to forty years .
74876	0	a	Yeah ,
74877	0	a	I was
74878	0	a	Yeah .
74879	0	a	Yeah .
74880	0	a	And elderly from forty eight to their death .
74881	0	a	I think it is
74882	0	a	In the entire mankind .
74883	0	a	I think it is the most useful remote control ever to be manufactured .
74884	0	a	Okay ,
74885	0	a	you are very enthusiastic about your own design ,
74886	0	a	huh ?
74887	0	a	As well for the for the older people ?
74888	0	a	And would it be easy for them to use the speech recognition ?
74889	0	a	Because that might
74890	0	a	Also if you are sixty years old Also
74891	0	a	Yeah , as well
74892	0	a	as your if you are fif sixty years old , you are holding one of those things in your hand
74893	0	a	No ,
74894	0	a	but we are going to th make this f for a all kind of people ,
74895	0	a	so it it it has to be
74896	0	a	If you read the manual ,
74897	0	a	always .
74898	0	a	Yeah ,
74899	0	a	but because it has the regular controls ,
74900	0	a	li
74901	0	a	as you can see in the screen now , and you do not have all the other options always on your screen .
74902	0	a	So it is t
74903	0	a	I think it is really easy to use .
74904	0	a	Yeah .
74905	0	a	You want these options to
74906	0	a	sure .
74907	0	a	Yeah ,
74908	0	a	but
74909	0	a	Yeah ,
74910	0	a	but they they do not want the extra options ,
74911	0	a	right ?
74912	0	a	So
74913	0	a	Yeah , okay ,
74914	0	a	but so they could
74915	0	a	I think it is .
74916	0	a	If they read a manual .
74917	0	a	M
74918	0	a	maybe that is the most user friendly and easy to use .
74919	0	a	Perhaps that is one of the most because a lot of
74920	0	a	Channel one , channel four ,
74921	0	a	yeah .
74922	0	a	Yeah , alright .
74923	0	a	Because it
74924	0	a	it is not it is not
74925	0	a	it is it is not difficult .
74926	0	a	You say you say record to to the to the speech recognition , then you say the question and the answer .
74927	0	a	And that is everything it does , the speech recognition .
74928	0	a	Yeah , well
74929	0	a	maybe that would make it even more easy to use for them .
74930	0	a	Yeah .
74931	0	a	I think it would make it I would make it two .
74932	0	a	Yeah , I think it does .
74933	0	a	So
74934	0	a	Also two ?
74935	0	a	Not a seven for this ?
74936	0	a	I would also say three .
74937	0	a	Because all the people who ca not
74938	0	a	a two .
74939	0	a	Yeah .
74940	0	a	Sure , two .
74941	0	a	Oh .
74942	0	a	I would say three .
74943	0	a	Three ?
74944	0	a	Oh .
74945	0	a	Okay , so
74946	0	a	we have three three two two
74947	0	a	or
74948	1	a	So what are we going to do ?
74949	0	a	Okay ,
74950	1	a	a three ,
74951	0	a	I see .
74952	0	a	You ?
74953	0	a	Oh .
74954	0	a	Two .
74955	0	a	Well
74956	1	a	Two and a half .
74957	1	a	Another question .
74958	0	a	Three ?
74959	0	a	No .
74960	0	a	Give me more .
74961	0	a	Remotes overwhelmed with buttons .
74962	0	a	No .
74963	0	a	No .
74964	0	a	No .
74965	0	a	No ,
74966	0	a	that that is that is
74967	0	a	yeah .
74968	0	a	But I mean ,
74969	0	a	that is definitely one .
74970	0	a	Tha that is a one , I think , that is definitely a one .
74971	0	a	That is definitely our
74972	0	a	A false
74973	0	a	, yeah .
74974	0	a	Oh nee , oh
74975	0	a	seven is it ?
74976	0	a	It is .
74977	0	a	No ?
74978	0	a	Oh yeah .
74979	0	a	Yeah ,
74980	0	a	the remote score .
74981	0	a	Yeah .
74982	0	a	Yeah ,
74983	1	a	but I think you should make it one scale with with one being good and seven being bad ,
74984	0	a	because otherwise we ca not calculate anything from the results ,
74985	0	a	so
74986	0	a	Okay ,
74987	0	a	a one ,
74988	0	a	because we designed for that ,
74989	0	a	huh ?
74990	0	a	Yeah .
74991	0	a	Yeah ,
74992	1	a	I think is not , this has to be something like is not overwhelmed .
74993	1	a	It is not overwhelmed .
74994	0	a	Yeah .
74995	0	a	Yeah , indeed .
74996	0	a	True .
74997	0	a	Yep .
74998	0	a	Remote control has colours that different that meet different target groups .
74999	0	a	Yes .
75000	0	a	Cause we make them in different colours ,
75001	0	a	so that they
75002	0	a	Yeah .
75003	0	a	Yeah .
75004	0	a	Yeah ,
75005	0	a	is optional .
75006	0	a	That is true .
75007	0	a	Yeah ,
75008	0	a	and I though w we had about single colours ,
75009	1	a	but you can also make a wood colour , not just one single colour but a wood like thing ,
75010	0	a	ca not you ?
75011	1	a	Whether it looks like wood , it is not w it is not wood
75012	0	a	but
75013	0	a	You can make a print on rubber ,
75014	0	a	ca not you ?
75015	0	a	Yeah .
75016	0	a	Huh .
75017	0	a	That it that it looks like wood , like something , yeah .
75018	0	a	Also with rubber ?
75019	0	a	Yeah , okay .
75020	0	a	I think you can .
75021	0	a	It it feels like rubber ,
75022	0	a	but
75023	0	a	Well
75024	0	a	but then when you scratch it it does come off .
75025	0	a	Yeah .
75026	0	a	Yeah ?
75027	0	a	That is a one ?
75028	0	a	Okay .
75029	0	a	So that is a one then ,
75030	0	a	huh ?
75031	0	a	Do you have many questions ?
75032	0	a	Oh ,
75033	0	a	okay
75034	0	a	well
75035	0	a	Yeah ,
75036	0	a	but we have We also We have to get to the money .
75037	0	a	Yeah ,
75038	0	a	it is it is harder to to like
75039	0	a	Geez .
75040	0	a	So that is a bit
75041	0	a	Oh
75042	0	a	we have time .
75043	0	a	I have
75044	0	a	The material used is spongy ,
75045	0	a	that that is that is a one ,
75046	0	a	that is m rubber .
75047	0	a	We are getting paid .
75048	0	a	We are getting paid .
75049	0	a	What ?
75050	0	a	Yeah ,
75051	0	a	yeah , it is very spongy .
75052	0	a	What spongy .
75053	0	a	Yeah ,
75054	0	a	I th think it is not the most spongy thing .
75055	0	a	Oh
75056	0	a	but not it is not very spongy ,
75057	0	a	because it is hard rubber .
75058	0	a	I think it is a three .
75059	0	a	Yeah , it is a three ,
75060	0	a	because you want to make it rather flexible but not too flexible , because it has a LCD screen .
75061	0	a	Yeah .
75062	0	a	Uh huh
75063	0	a	, yeah .
75064	0	a	Hard but
75065	0	a	Yeah .
75066	0	a	You can break it .
75067	0	a	Yeah .
75068	0	a	Remote control is hard to lose .
75069	0	a	Hard to lose ,
75070	0	a	yeah it sh and it is easy to find .
75071	0	a	Y
75072	0	a	yeah ,
75073	0	a	you could you could call it .
75074	0	a	Y you ca not you ca not lose it if you are sixty years old .
75075	0	a	If first time see the thing you didn did not adjust set the microphone , and then you lose it , then you have lost it .
75076	0	a	Yeah , y you can lose it , but it is not hard to lose .
75077	0	a	It is not hard , no .
75078	0	a	I think I think this is a two , personally .
75079	0	a	Two .
75080	0	a	That it is hard to lose ?
75081	0	a	Yeah ,
75082	0	a	it it is there is the
75083	0	a	it is a six , you think ?
75084	0	a	So it is a two .
75085	0	a	No .
75086	0	a	Is not hard to lose .
75087	0	a	Yeah ,
75088	0	a	so is not hard to lose you .
75089	0	a	Is not hard to lose ,
75090	0	a	yeah .
75091	0	a	Is not hard to lose .
75092	0	a	Yeah , you can lose it ,
75093	0	a	so I do not
75094	0	a	you can make it a three
75095	0	a	I
75096	0	a	It does have an a built in function .
75097	0	a	Yeah .
75098	0	a	You ca not lose it .
75099	0	a	Or if you are you are sixty years old , your demands
75100	0	a	I think
75101	0	a	yeah ,
75102	0	a	I think also .
75103	0	a	Yeah ,
75104	0	a	but a har
75105	0	a	A hard to lose is good .
75106	0	a	So it should this question should be hard to lose .
75107	0	a	Nee .
75108	0	a	Hard to lose .
75109	0	a	It is difficult to lose it .
75110	0	a	Oh right .
75111	0	a	Yeah ,
75112	0	a	this this is hard to lose .
75113	0	a	It is hard to lose .
75114	0	a	Yeah ,
75115	0	a	so then this is it is almost true , so a two .
75116	0	a	This
75117	0	a	Two , yeah .
75118	0	a	A two .
75119	0	a	A two .
75120	0	a	Okay .
75121	0	a	And most all because of the option to
75122	0	a	Whoa .
75123	0	a	Huh ?
75124	0	a	Yeah ?
75125	0	a	Oh , okay .
75126	0	a	Ooh .
75127	0	a	Yeah ,
75128	0	a	it is okay .
75129	0	a	That happens above also .
75130	0	a	Oh .
75131	1	a	But maybe when you scroll away and back it will be normal ,
75132	0	a	but
75133	0	a	Yep .
75134	0	a	No .
75135	0	a	Oh ,
75136	0	a	it is not ,
75137	0	a	well okay .
75138	0	a	Oh well ,
75139	0	a	it does not .
75140	1	a	Remember .
75141	1	a	put the cor cursor on the .
75142	0	a	Okay okay okay .
75143	0	a	Remote control mainly be sold to younger people .
75144	1	a	Click .
75145	0	a	True .
75146	0	a	I think it will , yeah .
75147	0	a	Yeah ?
75148	0	a	True ?
75149	0	a	Very true ?
75150	0	a	No , I do not think very true because the colours .
75151	0	a	True .
75152	0	a	yeah .
75153	0	a	well
75154	0	a	I a
75155	0	a	a two .
75156	0	a	Materials ,
75157	0	a	yeah .
75158	0	a	There .
75159	0	a	We have the colours .
75160	0	a	we have the buttons is are not that that much .
75161	0	a	Nah ,
75162	0	a	the material is not that
75163	0	a	So
75164	0	a	I don I think
75165	0	a	I think it is a three .
75166	0	a	It is it is much more younger .
75167	0	a	okay .
75168	0	a	So ma make it make it a two .
75169	0	a	Well
75170	0	a	I think it is it is a lower number , so better
75171	0	a	because w we designed it for young people especially ,
75172	0	a	did not we ?
75173	0	a	What do you think ?
75174	0	a	Questions ?
75175	0	a	Two .
75176	0	a	Yeah .
75177	0	a	Yeah ,
75178	0	a	but I
75179	0	a	Okay , okay .
75180	0	a	I think it is a two
75181	0	a	but
75182	0	a	Two two two .
75183	0	a	I think because
75184	0	a	yeah ?
75185	0	a	In the features ?
75186	0	a	Because younger peoples are cr critical
75187	0	a	and they wanted a lot of features on this thing .
75188	0	a	A two ?
75189	0	a	I think it is two .
75190	0	a	I think it is two too , two too too .
75191	0	a	Uh huh .
75192	1	a	Let is make everything a two .
75193	0	a	Dissatisfy younger people .
75194	0	a	Younger people .
75195	0	a	Yeah ,
75196	0	a	but those are more fancy functions , not not really many features or something .
75197	0	a	It has What did
75198	0	a	Yeah .
75199	0	a	Well
75200	0	a	perhaps not .
75201	0	a	Well
75202	0	a	that it does not .
75203	0	a	Well ,
75204	0	a	n not exactly
75205	0	a	but if it had some games on it or something like that , but it is for a remote control I think it i
75206	0	a	it would satisfy those needs .
75207	0	a	Yeah
75208	0	a	bu but
75209	0	a	I think they like the speech .
75210	0	a	Yeah , the speech possibility ,
75211	0	a	the colours .
75212	0	a	You could call to your
75213	0	a	yeah , and the screen ,
75214	0	a	yeah .
75215	0	a	LCD screen and scroll .
75216	0	a	Scroll options , yeah .
75217	0	a	I I think they will be quite met with their expectations .
75218	0	a	Right ,
75219	0	a	that that that
75220	0	a	those are features .
75221	0	a	No .
75222	0	a	It has relatively few features ,
75223	0	a	with
75224	0	a	Yeah .
75225	0	a	It is three features , basically , the LCD touch screen is feature .
75226	0	a	Yeah .
75227	0	a	The microphone is a feature .
75228	0	a	No ,
75229	0	a	are not the features
75230	0	a	the microphone is feature and that you can change the channel is feature , and that you can change the volume is feature , and that you can change the options of the remote , something like that .
75231	0	a	Yeah , okay .
75232	0	a	Ours had other features with
75233	0	a	Okay ,
75234	0	a	you think one ,
75235	0	a	what do you think ?
75236	0	a	You .
75237	0	a	I think
75238	0	a	yeah ,
75239	0	a	and then you have the audio settings , channel setting , video settings .
75240	0	a	Yeah .
75241	0	a	The easy volume up button .
75242	0	a	Those are features .
75243	0	a	Remote
75244	0	a	younger people usually use the remote control to put on the volume .
75245	0	a	Yeah yeah .
75246	0	a	Turn turn up the volume .
75247	0	a	So I have chos I shou
75248	0	a	I think it is it is it is a one .
75249	0	a	Enough features ?
75250	0	a	Yeah .
75251	0	a	Personally ,
75252	0	a	yeah .
75253	0	a	I think once you have
75254	0	a	cause you have the channel features
75255	0	a	b
75256	0	a	you have the screen features , audio features ,
75257	0	a	the
75258	0	a	you have all buttons on it which you would like , microphone extra , LCD screen extra , scroll thing extra .
75259	0	a	I think two or three .
75260	0	a	three
75261	0	a	, yeah .
75262	0	a	Two .
75263	0	a	I would say three ,
75264	0	a	so two it is then
75265	0	a	or
75266	0	a	Yeah .
75267	0	a	Yeah .
75268	0	a	Yeah
75269	0	a	a two a two .
75270	1	a	Make it make it a two .
75271	0	a	One two three .
75272	1	a	Or make it a fucking two .
75273	0	a	Just another two .
75274	0	a	We like two .
75275	0	a	Right .
75276	0	a	You can see the remote control is R and R .
75277	0	a	Yeah , there is R and R in front .
75278	0	a	Yep .
75279	0	a	it is not the colour ,
75280	1	a	so maybe you should make two ,
75281	0	a	but it has R and R .
75282	0	a	Has
75283	0	a	oh yeah ,
75284	0	a	do did have nah y
75285	0	a	you have the black one .
75286	0	a	Yeah .
75287	0	a	And we will probably make also a yellow one .
75288	0	a	Yeah , but not R and R yellow
75289	0	a	I think .
75290	0	a	Yeah .
75291	0	a	Yeah ,
75292	0	a	maybe maybe two .
75293	0	a	Well
75294	0	a	m th
75295	0	a	but the logo is on on the front ,
75296	0	a	so a two
75297	0	a	, yeah ,
75298	0	a	that is
75299	0	a	Oh , well
75300	0	a	that is that is pretty good ,
75301	0	a	huh ?
75302	0	a	That was your evaluation show ,
75303	0	a	okay , so
75304	0	a	we do not have to calculate anything because of these results .
75305	0	a	Maybe two .
75306	0	a	Okay , true , yeah .
75307	0	a	One d on i it is the colours and the
75308	0	a	I think it is ,
75309	0	a	but I do not know what you think .
75310	0	a	X marks spot .
75311	0	a	And the menu is avail that is available is easy to use .
75312	0	a	I think it is easier to use than a regular remote control ,
75313	0	a	because when you push on the options menu , you get the the the various options entirely explained .
75314	0	a	Yeah , tha that is so true .
75315	0	a	Entirely explained .
75316	0	a	Instead of just finding out what an icon means on a button .
75317	0	a	Yeah ,
75318	0	a	I think that wou that would be quite hard to learn to use it .
75319	0	a	And you can navigate easier ,
75320	0	a	because wi with the you have to push the the the arrows and with a normal TV remote .
75321	0	a	Yeah , you can navigate .
75322	0	a	You are not satisfied ,
75323	0	a	okay .
75324	0	a	No
75325	0	a	, I am not not convinc .
75326	1	a	Let is start over again then .
75327	0	a	Yeah .
75328	0	a	Let is make a different remote .
75329	0	a	Let is go th for
75330	0	a	I think it would be a t yeah , two .
75331	0	a	Well
75332	0	a	Menu .
75333	0	a	A two ?
75334	0	a	We only have twos .
75335	0	a	Now lower .
75336	0	a	A two .
75337	0	a	Oh yeah , I think so .
75338	0	a	Yeah .
75339	0	a	just twos .
75340	0	a	So okay ,
75341	0	a	we have one three , a one , that that have to got up .
75342	0	a	And three .
75343	0	a	One three and a few ones .
75344	0	a	Two threes .
75345	0	a	Two two two two two .
75346	0	a	We m mostly have twos ,
75347	0	a	so it is pretty good .
75348	0	a	So two , yeah .
75349	0	a	The average is a two .
75350	0	a	Yeah .
75351	0	a	That is quite good in my opinion .
75352	0	a	The average .
75353	0	a	Yeah .
75354	0	a	I think so too .
75355	0	a	Yeah , I think so .
75356	0	a	That
75357	0	a	Ooh .
75358	0	a	We can be happy .
75359	0	a	Save .
75360	0	a	Ooh .
75361	0	a	Yeah .
75362	0	a	What is it ?
75363	0	a	It is like a bug or something .
75364	0	a	It is a fly .
75365	0	a	A fly , yeah .
75366	0	a	Oh m
75367	0	a	Yeah .
75368	0	a	A f butterfly .
75369	1	a	Top .
75370	0	a	Yeah .
75371	0	a	That is it .
75372	0	a	Okay .
75373	0	a	Yes .
75374	0	a	Sure .
75375	0	a	No ,
75376	0	a	it is two .
75377	0	a	Okay , good .
75378	0	a	The average is two .
75379	0	a	It is good .
75380	0	a	let is see
75381	0	a	oh ,
75382	0	a	it is not asked to save but it did already
75383	0	a	And this
75384	0	a	Everything okay .
75385	0	a	Yeah .
75386	0	a	Yeah ,
75387	0	a	I
75388	0	a	I saved it .
75389	0	a	Exactly .
75390	0	a	Well ,
75391	0	a	the next part might be a little bit difficult to do in a group ,
75392	1	a	but I am willing to try it .
75393	0	a	Because we are going to look at the finance and I have a nice Excel sheet to do that .
75394	0	a	Yeah .
75395	0	a	Redesign .
75396	0	a	No .
75397	0	a	And I am not sure if I put it in the project folder .
75398	1	a	look on that .
75399	1	a	and we are going to calculate the production costs ,
75400	0	a	and if they are under or at twelve Euro fifty , we are good ,
75401	1	a	and if they are not we are going to re design , but we have to do that very very quick
75402	1	a	I think ,
75403	0	a	yes .
75404	0	a	Yeah .
75405	0	a	Yeah .
75406	0	a	So we are going to erase features or something .
75407	0	a	I do not know if I put the Excel sheet in the
75408	0	a	n not in the folder .
75409	0	a	Do you have the cost
75410	0	a	or
75411	0	a	Let is hope .
75412	0	a	f fifty five Euros .
75413	0	a	We are going to be here at eight o'clock .
75414	0	a	I think it is
75415	0	a	I think it is still in my own documents folder .
75416	0	a	We are goin still going to be here at eight o'clock .
75417	0	a	No .
75418	0	a	I doubt it .
75419	0	a	Oh shit .
75420	0	a	Perhaps we have got features that do not exist in the Excel sheet .
75421	0	a	Yeah yeah , maybe .
75422	0	a	So Okay , well
75423	0	a	this is it .
75424	0	a	The microphone .
75425	0	a	No ,
75426	0	a	it was in my my information ,
75427	0	a	so
75428	0	a	Yeah .
75429	0	a	Yeah .
75430	0	a	It i It was not too much .
75431	0	a	Yeah ?
75432	0	a	maybe you are going scrap scrap it .
75433	0	a	As well as the LCD screen .
75434	0	a	Whoa .
75435	0	a	Well ,
75436	0	a	if it does not work
75437	0	a	I want to fill it in , but
75438	0	a	But you should direct
75439	0	a	The number of
75440	0	a	We have got a battery ,
75441	0	a	one or t two batteries , or not ?
75442	0	a	nee
75443	0	a	one battery , with two small batteries .
75444	1	a	maybe I could ask one of you to fill it in ,
75445	1	a	so that I can also take minutes ,
75446	1	a	and maybe the other can use that thing to count numerous functions .
75447	0	a	No prob .
75448	0	a	Count it ?
75449	0	a	Li like write it be
75450	0	a	, okay , cool .
75451	0	a	Well
75452	0	a	we have to count some things and we have to think about some things .
75453	0	a	Count it .
75454	1	a	But you have to fill in this column , huh ?
75455	0	a	No , count number of functions , because for every button you have to pay and there are different screen shots , so or different different screens ,
75456	0	a	so
75457	0	a	Yeah ,
75458	0	a	but it is it is more about the energy source ,
75459	0	a	huh ?
75460	0	a	Do you use a hand dynamo , a battery , kinetic or solar cells ?
75461	1	a	We will wait .
75462	0	a	You got Excel to count .
75463	0	a	Oh okay .
75464	0	a	Well
75465	0	a	I dra
75466	1	a	Danny , Danny , I will do that ,
75467	0	a	because I draw the
75468	0	a	No , no solar cell , no no no no .
75469	0	a	Huh ?
75470	0	a	Yeah ?
75471	0	a	Oh , yea yeah ,
75472	0	a	you design it .
75473	0	a	Yeah .
75474	0	a	Yeah .
75475	1	a	I would do a battery we do .
75476	1	a	Solar cell .
75477	0	a	Right ?
75478	1	a	A battery .
75479	0	a	No
75480	0	a	it took a battery ?
75481	0	a	Yeah .
75482	1	a	One battery ,
75483	0	a	right ?
75484	0	a	Electronics , simple chip
75485	0	a	advanced chip ,
75486	0	a	right ?
75487	0	a	Yeah ,
75488	0	a	so this one and this one .
75489	0	a	Yeah .
75490	0	a	No hand dynamo .
75491	0	a	Hand
75492	0	a	On advanced chip .
75493	0	a	We have
75494	0	a	No ,
75495	0	a	we have sample speaker .
75496	0	a	But b al but we also have sample speaker , do
75497	0	a	Oh ,
75498	0	a	we already on nine .
75499	0	a	Yeah ,
75500	0	a	yeah .
75501	0	a	we ha we have single
75502	0	a	what ?
75503	0	a	Are we ?
75504	0	a	Oh yay .
75505	0	a	We have double curved .
75506	0	a	Single nee single curved .
75507	0	a	The single .
75508	0	a	Single .
75509	0	a	Double curved was see ju
75510	0	a	three dimensional .
75511	0	a	But it is not three dimensional ,
75512	0	a	it is not curved in a l
75513	0	a	No no no ,
75514	0	a	single curved is like this .
75515	0	a	This one is
75516	0	a	This one is curved like this ,
75517	0	a	right .
75518	0	a	Oh
75519	0	a	the the
75520	0	a	it is not going to work people .
75521	0	a	We have rubber .
75522	1	a	I will just fill it in .
75523	0	a	It is curved like this .
75524	0	a	rubber indeed ?
75525	0	a	Yeah , I think that will be our best bet .
75526	0	a	Yeah ,
75527	0	a	bu what
75528	0	a	Oh ,
75529	0	a	but we have curves like it and it .
75530	0	a	that is the only curve you made , not th curved like that .
75531	0	a	That is
75532	0	a	Huh ?
75533	0	a	Yeah .
75534	0	a	There are two curves ,
75535	0	a	right ?
75536	0	a	Oh , okay I understand , I understand .
75537	0	a	Thirteen ?
75538	0	a	With a scroll wheel ,
75539	0	a	right ?
75540	0	a	Is he integrated ?
75541	0	a	No ,
75542	0	a	eh ?
75543	0	a	I do not know .
75544	0	a	Rubber .
75545	0	a	Push button .
75546	0	a	Yeah ,
75547	0	a	we gotta integrate scroll wheel and push button ,
75548	0	a	because when you push it and you w it wo not just pu makes possible to s
75549	0	a	Not going to work ?
75550	0	a	Okay .
75551	0	a	No , we do not have push button .
75552	0	a	Oh yeah , right ,
75553	0	a	we want it to it is not it is not no .
75554	0	a	LCD display .
75555	0	a	Yep .
75556	0	a	Fifteen ,
75557	0	a	oh , too bad .
75558	0	a	Okay
75559	0	a	But now button supplements .
75560	0	a	Oh
75561	0	a	but with special colour we have .
75562	0	a	A special form ,
75563	0	a	right ?
75564	0	a	Oh ,
75565	0	a	we do not have any buttons ,
75566	0	a	so
75567	0	a	Yeah ,
75568	0	a	we need to
75569	0	a	No ,
75570	0	a	we have fifteen and
75571	0	a	oh , right .
75572	0	a	We do not got the button supplements .
75573	0	a	Eighteen and a half ,
75574	0	a	damn .
75575	0	a	We have to lower it with six points .
75576	0	a	Damn .
75577	0	a	Okay .
75578	0	a	Twelve and half .
75579	1	a	We could lose the curve .
75580	0	a	Nah .
75581	0	a	We could use
75582	1	a	I think we should scrap the sample speaker .
75583	0	a	Yeah , I would lose the curve .
75584	1	a	We could lose the scroll wheel .
75585	1	a	You could make it just a regular scroll wheel .
75586	0	a	But you ca not push it , so you have to tap .
75587	0	a	Yeah ,
75588	1	a	if you ca not push it you have to tap the the options window button here and then scroll down with the d with with the button .
75589	0	a	Yeah , alright .
75590	0	a	So normal scroll wheel ?
75591	1	a	And I think we should lose the curve .
75592	0	a	Normal scroll wheel .
75593	0	a	Lose
75594	0	a	Okay , so
75595	0	a	we do not exactly need the single We do not need a curve .
75596	0	a	It is four pri it four units .
75597	0	a	Yeah ,
75598	0	a	but if you would i
75599	0	a	it is a new feature ,
75600	0	a	it it is something special .
75601	0	a	But w d wha Curved
75602	0	a	then it will be square .
75603	0	a	No ,
75604	0	a	the curve does not really
75605	0	a	No ,
75606	0	a	then it will wo not stand up from the table .
75607	1	a	Is possible to lose curve .
75608	0	a	Then it would just
75609	0	a	Yeah .
75610	0	a	Okay .
75611	0	a	Was that
75612	0	a	does that mean to it , single curve ?
75613	0	a	Okay .
75614	0	a	Yeah , that is meant with scr with s curve .
75615	0	a	The curve is in a dimension .
75616	0	a	If you make it a flat one , s
75617	0	a	n it is no curve , you got no curves .
75618	0	a	So
75619	0	a	We would lose this one ?
75620	0	a	Yeah ,
75621	0	a	we could s yeah , a bit .
75622	0	a	Yeah , but tha that that only is one .
75623	0	a	Yeah , okay .
75624	0	a	No ,
75625	0	a	two .
75626	0	a	No ,
75627	0	a	one .
75628	0	a	Sixteen point three .
75629	0	a	Oh ,
75630	0	a	okay , indeed .
75631	0	a	So
75632	0	a	we do not
75633	0	a	Yeah ,
75634	0	a	we also have to
75635	0	a	No ,
75636	0	a	otherwise we do not have an LCD screen .
75637	0	a	So
75638	0	a	we still
75639	0	a	Could could we do it on a regular chip on print or something ?
75640	0	a	No ?
75641	0	a	Ma y
75642	0	a	you just ca not do that , or We changed th
75643	0	a	Yeah ,
75644	0	a	and the single curved to uncurved .
75645	0	a	Is it possible to make
75646	0	a	No .
75647	0	a	And what did you change ?
75648	0	a	You changed the scroll wheel
75649	0	a	and
75650	0	a	Oh ,
75651	0	a	but it is just one point ,
75652	1	a	so maybe you should should
75653	0	a	Yeah ,
75654	1	a	you should you should drop the speech recognition .
75655	0	a	Single curved .
75656	0	a	Flat .
75657	0	a	Yeah ,
75658	0	a	so that does does not does not that mu
75659	0	a	I think
75660	1	a	Scrap sample speaker ?
75661	0	a	That that is
75662	0	a	Yes , four points .
75663	0	a	No .
75664	0	a	The sample speaker is two d wait , f s four points .
75665	0	a	Yeah ,
75666	0	a	but it is t
75667	0	a	Yeah ,
75668	0	a	but it is it it is a new feature ,
75669	0	a	it is something special .
75670	1	a	And then you can keep the curve .
75671	0	a	Or ca not you ?
75672	1	a	Or make it on a hand dynamo ,
75673	0	a	but I do not think that will work .
75674	0	a	Yeah ,
75675	0	a	becau when you lose the
75676	0	a	Yeah .
75677	0	a	Yeah ,
75678	1	a	but what what else what else do you want to scrap ?
75679	0	a	F
75680	0	a	You have to we have to scrap four points .
75681	1	a	I do not know .
75682	0	a	Yeah , that is difficult .
75683	0	a	Yeah .
75684	0	a	Ma make it with wood instead of rubber ?
75685	0	a	Yeah ,
75686	0	a	it it i
75687	0	a	Yeah ,
75688	0	a	it also it also takes one point less .
75689	0	a	No ,
75690	0	a	that is
75691	0	a	no .
75692	0	a	Make it w
75693	0	a	when you made it a remote control of wood ?
75694	0	a	You do not make a remote control of .
75695	0	a	Yeah ,
75696	1	a	We could make it titanium instead of rubber .
75697	0	a	Yeah ,
75698	0	a	but a wooden remote control only helps for old people we discussed ,
75699	0	a	yes ?
75700	0	a	Yeah , but it is only a half .
75701	0	a	Oh .
75702	0	a	Oh
75703	0	a	can I ask something ?
75704	0	a	What is special colour ?
75705	0	a	Is that the wood wood
75706	0	a	this , we have to have that one too ?
75707	0	a	Th then we still have too much
75708	0	a	if we use the
75709	0	a	Yeah ,
75710	0	a	we we scrap that one ?
75711	0	a	See , a po
75712	0	a	three .
75713	0	a	Yeah .
75714	0	a	I think it is .
75715	0	a	It is not .
75716	0	a	What ?
75717	0	a	To knock the sample speaker , yeah .
75718	0	a	Yeah .
75719	1	a	But I think the only option is to drop the sample speaker .
75720	0	a	Yeah .
75721	0	a	Sample speaker .
75722	1	a	And sample sensor .
75723	0	a	Yeah , okay ,
75724	0	a	three .
75725	0	a	But m yeah , course ,
75726	0	a	but
75727	0	a	What we will have .
75728	0	a	Point three .
75729	0	a	Huh ?
75730	0	a	Point twelve .
75731	1	a	Let is make it thirteen or fourteen .
75732	0	a	We need point three .
75733	0	a	That is a scroll wheel .
75734	0	a	it is a colour .
75735	1	a	Do not make it wood .
75736	0	a	A colour .
75737	0	a	Yeah ,
75738	0	a	but a wood
75739	1	a	we can make it brown , dark brown , not wood .
75740	0	a	Make it
75741	0	a	Yeah ,
75742	0	a	but it is it is special colour ,
75743	0	a	is it a all kind of colours ?
75744	0	a	It is also green
75745	0	a	or
75746	0	a	Yeah ,
75747	0	a	but it is a special colour than just rubber colour .
75748	0	a	Yeah ,
75749	0	a	special colours , fruity colours .
75750	0	a	Is it also
75751	0	a	no that that is just normal colour fruit colours .
75752	0	a	Yeah .
75753	0	a	Normal colours , yellow
75754	0	a	Yeah ,
75755	0	a	but then I d I do not think we can ever make to a twelve and half .
75756	0	a	You have to add something to the rubber to make it green .
75757	0	a	Yeah .
75758	0	a	You do not say here is green rubber .
75759	0	a	They do not sell green rubber plants .
75760	0	a	Alright .
75761	0	a	Yeah , you can ,
75762	0	a	you should you have to lose
75763	0	a	No ,
75764	1	a	it is the scroll wheel , I guess .
75765	1	a	But then we have to scrap LCD display , we have to scrap s advanced chip .
75766	0	a	No no no .
75767	0	a	No
75768	1	a	then we have to scrap everything we got
75769	0	a	because how many colours we going to make ?
75770	0	a	Five ?
75771	0	a	Then we have two .
75772	1	a	If we lose the scroll wheel and make it totally depending dependent on the touch screen then it is possible to make .
75773	0	a	S
75774	0	a	touch .
75775	1	a	A push ,
75776	0	a	yeah .
75777	1	a	Then we can make add two colours on it .
75778	1	a	And then you can
75779	1	a	and then you can add to the colours .
75780	0	a	Yeah ,
75781	0	a	two colours it .
75782	0	a	Special c
75783	0	a	Okay ,
75784	0	a	if you lose if you lose the
75785	0	a	You lose this one , you got eleven point five
75786	1	a	and you make i and then you can make the spec single curve , for example .
75787	0	a	Switch colours .
75788	0	a	It was such a great idea .
75789	1	a	They can add two colours .
75790	0	a	But the colours .
75791	0	a	how ma the colours like l
75792	0	a	she told , is that all the colours we add
75793	0	a	or
75794	0	a	Yeah ,
75795	0	a	but we we we are we have yellow , red , black , titanium .
75796	0	a	How d how many colours ?
75797	0	a	Special colours , all the colours you want ,
75798	0	a	because you want to make p
75799	0	a	Yeah ,
75800	0	a	but when you use more than one colour , it is a special colour .
75801	0	a	What do you mean ?
75802	0	a	Oh .
75803	0	a	okay .
75804	0	a	But I think when you use the colour that is not originally the rubber
75805	0	a	then you use special colour ,
75806	0	a	cause you have to add it .
75807	0	a	I suppose .
75808	0	a	Yeah .
75809	0	a	Yeah ,
75810	0	a	but the rubbers alls original black .
75811	0	a	Yeah ,
75812	0	a	so you always lose the special colour .
75813	1	a	You co you could make it always black , like normal remote .
75814	0	a	Yeah
75815	0	a	b
75816	0	a	Yeah ,
75817	0	a	but we are going to make it yellow red ,
75818	0	a	and then you add you have two special colours on top of the one we have now .
75819	0	a	Nee
75820	0	a	we we also want to make ano another colour .
75821	0	a	Oh right , yeah .
75822	0	a	Yeah ,
75823	0	a	we should u
75824	0	a	Yeah .
75825	0	a	Yeah ,
75826	0	a	but m
75827	0	a	Yeah ,
75828	0	a	because we have more colours than only black .
75829	1	a	We have to make this like four or five or something .
75830	0	a	That is what it means .
75831	0	a	Yeah ,
75832	0	a	but is not it per remote that you pay ?
75833	0	a	Half ?
75834	0	a	I think you pay half per remote .
75835	0	a	Yeah .
75836	0	a	I
75837	0	a	then I think I p
75838	0	a	I don
75839	0	a	I do not think they
75840	0	a	me mean they are special
75841	0	a	Yeah , okay okay , true .
75842	0	a	Oh right , yeah .
75843	0	a	Is it per remote ?
75844	0	a	Yeah .
75845	0	a	Yeah , that is right ,
75846	0	a	and you
75847	0	a	one colour per remote .
75848	0	a	So each remote with a special colour .
75849	0	a	Yeah , indeed , yeah .
75850	0	a	So then it is one .
75851	0	a	You do not need four of those four of those special colours in one in one remote .
75852	0	a	True , true .
75853	0	a	No .
75854	0	a	I hope .
75855	0	a	We have two points spare .
75856	0	a	So
75857	0	a	the battery , we have advanced chip on print .
75858	0	a	Nee
75859	0	a	one point .
75860	0	a	One .
75861	1	a	So it would be curved , single curve .
75862	0	a	Because of thing
75863	0	a	Yeah , well you can at least make it curved again .
75864	0	a	Or not ?
75865	0	a	So
75866	0	a	y you just ca not make a nice remote .
75867	0	a	Yeah , single curve .
75868	0	a	Because that was very important ,
75869	0	a	huh ?
75870	0	a	So
75871	0	a	it is curved ,
75872	0	a	it is still that
75873	0	a	so
75874	0	a	we we dropped the speech recognition together with the speaker .
75875	0	a	It is too bad for the speaker .
75876	0	a	Should we change that tha that that is a one if not , or not ?
75877	0	a	Could you copy it ?
75878	0	a	And make it
75879	0	a	The entire
75880	1	a	Perhaps you can then copy page or so .
75881	0	a	yep .
75882	0	a	We dropped the scroll wheel .
75883	0	a	And the rest is the same ,
75884	0	a	huh ?
75885	0	a	Am I right ?
75886	0	a	Yes .
75887	0	a	Y yea the scroll wheel is dropped .
75888	0	a	Yep .
75889	0	a	Huh .
75890	0	a	Ooh .
75891	0	a	No .
75892	0	a	Okay .
75893	0	a	Oh
75894	0	a	you you made the entire could you
75895	0	a	Oh
75896	0	a	not
75897	0	a	Well
75898	0	a	Undo , undo .
75899	0	a	Undo .
75900	0	a	So , kay .
75901	0	a	Twenty minutes ?
75902	0	a	Okay , so
75903	0	a	you had this list at start ?
75904	0	a	Alright .
75905	0	a	Would you ?
75906	0	a	By the
75907	1	a	Perhaps you can save this one , and then copy or something .
75908	0	a	Add it copy page .
75909	0	a	Select all .
75910	0	a	No ,
75911	0	a	but you c
75912	0	a	yeah .
75913	0	a	Alright ,
75914	0	a	something went wrong .
75915	0	a	Tap .
75916	0	a	Okay ,
75917	0	a	but this this new remote we can afford .
75918	0	a	It does not work .
75919	1	a	Let is forget .
75920	0	a	It should have work .
75921	0	a	No , I had not .
75922	0	a	When did you receive this list ?
75923	0	a	okay .
75924	0	a	I just received it .
75925	0	a	Yeah .
75926	0	a	Oh
75927	1	a	ignore that .
75928	0	a	They do not work so hard at the finance department .
75929	0	a	okay .
75930	0	a	I suppose this is a
75931	0	a	Okay , so
75932	0	a	we lose the scroll wheel ,
75933	0	a	the s
75934	0	a	And the microphone .
75935	0	a	Well , so
75936	0	a	Too bad .
75937	0	a	Yeah .
75938	0	a	The microphone .
75939	0	a	Yeah ,
75940	0	a	and that is it .
75941	0	a	Yeah .
75942	0	a	A
75943	0	a	and we changed something , I guess ,
75944	0	a	or not ?
75945	0	a	We
75946	0	a	Oh no .
75947	0	a	Yep .
75948	0	a	Okay .
75949	0	a	Twelve Euro fifty .
75950	0	a	and did you try to make a new design , or what were you trying to do ?
75951	0	a	It did not work .
75952	0	a	Yeah , I tried to copy that one , but it did not work .
75953	0	a	So we could fix it like tha that it is like this .
75954	0	a	Strange .
75955	0	a	You could select it all , but then you ca not erase .
75956	0	a	Strange .
75957	0	a	Oh , you can arrange
75958	0	a	, ca not you then just say copy ?
75959	0	a	New page .
75960	0	a	You can only re erase ?
75961	0	a	Oh .
75962	0	a	Erase .
75963	0	a	When you saw th li
75964	0	a	Earlier when we selected it , w I could not erase anything .
75965	0	a	no .
75966	0	a	Bling .
75967	0	a	Paste .
75968	0	a	Yes .
75969	0	a	Select none .
75970	1	a	Just tap somewhere .
75971	1	a	just up somewhere b besides it ,
75972	0	a	right .
75973	1	a	just tap somewhere .
75974	0	a	Okay ,
75975	0	a	and now you can erase .
75976	0	a	Yeah .
75977	0	a	I do not think I can ,
75978	1	a	but we can try .
75979	0	a	, we already try .
75980	0	a	Well
75981	0	a	it should be possible .
75982	0	a	Oh , yeah , no ,
75983	0	a	ha ha .
75984	0	a	Oh no .
75985	0	a	Well
75986	1	a	you can draw over it with white pen .
75987	0	a	No ?
75988	0	a	Evaluation drops .
75989	0	a	Yeah ,
75990	0	a	we tried it earlier .
75991	0	a	Oh .
75992	0	a	It is very much work .
75993	0	a	Yeah .
75994	0	a	Sorry .
75995	0	a	Well
75996	0	a	but that is also useful for the evaluation ,
75997	0	a	because I think we have a prototype now which we can afford
75998	1	a	and we only need to draw a little bit to get a good design .
75999	1	a	Doodle .
76000	1	a	And I think we should then move on to the production evaluation because of the time .
76001	1	a	And erase the mic .
76002	0	a	Yeah ,
76003	0	a	goodbye mic .
76004	0	a	All I need is no mic .
76005	0	a	Let is see ,
76006	0	a	we can save this now .
76007	0	a	Oh ,
76008	0	a	I already erased half of the line .
76009	0	a	Bon chance
76010	0	a	No ,
76011	0	a	add
76012	0	a	Yeah .
76013	0	a	And move back to here .
76014	0	a	Too bad , oh .
76015	0	a	Like this ?
76016	0	a	Still looks nice .
76017	0	a	And then all green .
76018	0	a	Okay , well
76019	0	a	thank you .
76020	0	a	Oh ,
76021	0	a	that is erase .
76022	0	a	Looks like a iPod .
76023	0	a	Oh ,
76024	0	a	no .
76025	0	a	Hey ,
76026	0	a	but you can erase that .
76027	0	a	Yeah , that is a bit weird .
76028	0	a	Uh oh .
76029	0	a	Oh ,
76030	0	a	now I am line .
76031	0	a	S Difference between lines and text and the pen .
76032	0	a	Yeah .
76033	0	a	Oh .
76034	0	a	Right .
76035	0	a	All I need is mic .
76036	0	a	And you ca not erase this ?
76037	0	a	, strange .
76038	0	a	No ,
76039	0	a	it is weird .
76040	0	a	Okay , well
76041	1	a	just leave it at this and quickly save .
76042	0	a	Station page .
76043	1	a	and then we are going to the project or product evaluation .
76044	0	a	Huh ,
76045	0	a	looks fucking boring now .
76046	0	a	We just did our project evaluation .
76047	0	a	well ,
76048	1	a	I think I can sit for that
76049	0	a	since it is almost my final slide .
76050	0	a	what did you think about the process ?
76051	0	a	How satisfied are we ?
76052	0	a	Deadlines were sometimes very short .
76053	0	a	Yeah .
76054	0	a	Bu but stressful .
76055	0	a	But
76056	0	a	And stressful .
76057	0	a	You think , no , my presentation is not ready .
76058	0	a	Yeah .
76059	1	a	I think we it should be b it would be better if we worked a little bit together .
76060	0	a	Yeah .
76061	0	a	Now we worked through each other ,
76062	0	a	something he said
76063	0	a	yeah ,
76064	0	a	and you had information I also had , so some some things I had in my presentation , they already told ,
76065	0	a	so
76066	0	a	So yeah ,
76067	0	a	that
76068	0	a	I do not think that is the best way to work at for such project .
76069	0	a	Yeah .
76070	1	a	And you could ask things .
76071	0	a	Yeah ,
76072	0	a	you had information I did not have
76073	0	a	and then
76074	0	a	Oh right .
76075	0	a	Yeah .
76076	0	a	Yeah .
76077	0	a	Yeah .
76078	0	a	And for me it sometimes was a surprise who was going to present what , huh ?
76079	0	a	And
76080	0	a	Yeah .
76081	0	a	Yeah .
76082	0	a	No .
76083	0	a	So you would say communicate during our individual work .
76084	0	a	Yeah , no ,
76085	1	a	or maybe session of five minutes together or something , and then work separate .
76086	0	a	Yeah ,
76087	1	a	but but why not work here together , for example ?
76088	0	a	Why should we be separated from each other in those difference different rooms ?
76089	0	a	Yeah .
76090	0	a	Yeah .
76091	0	a	Yeah , you could
76092	0	a	Yeah .
76093	0	a	Yeah .
76094	0	a	Yeah .
76095	0	a	Well ,
76096	0	a	probably to simulate the whole working process ,
76097	0	a	huh ,
76098	0	a	th
76099	0	a	you ca not have a meeting for several weeks .
76100	0	a	I think so too .
76101	0	a	Yeah ,
76102	0	a	but then you can work together too
76103	0	a	when A chat would also be
76104	0	a	Well ,
76105	0	a	I I do not really like the board , it does not really work great .
76106	0	a	Yeah m
76107	0	a	yeah ,
76108	0	a	like she told .
76109	0	a	Then you can work together too by mail or by , I dunno , chat , something ,
76110	0	a	but now we are completely separated from each other .
76111	0	a	Huh ,
76112	0	a	oh right .
76113	0	a	No .
76114	0	a	I do not think that was the best way ,
76115	0	a	but
76116	0	a	Yeah , the technology is okay .
76117	0	a	But the technology was fantastic .
76118	0	a	Work now ?
76119	0	a	Perhaps it is e
76120	0	a	Yeah ,
76121	1	a	perhaps it is easier to get one of those dig digital pens or so and to and lay it next to that keyboard over there .
76122	0	a	Yeah okay ,
76123	0	a	but I don I do
76124	0	a	I think becau that is because
76125	0	a	Yeah .
76126	0	a	Sometimes I think .
76127	0	a	It does work , but sometimes it does not erase
76128	0	a	or it does not
76129	0	a	Yeah .
76130	0	a	So you can draw see it over th on the screen .
76131	0	a	Yeah ,
76132	0	a	like the f like a plotters or something ,
76133	0	a	yeah .
76134	0	a	Yeah .
76135	0	a	Yeah .
76136	0	a	Yep
76137	0	a	yep
76138	0	a	yep
76139	0	a	yep yep .
76140	0	a	So
76141	0	a	you do not think the SMARTboard is is really useful
76142	0	a	or
76143	0	a	Yeah ,
76144	0	a	so it is maybe a bit unnatural also .
76145	0	a	But
76146	0	a	Well
76147	0	a	it is useful ,
76148	0	a	but it does not really work all the time .
76149	0	a	It is useful , but not m
76150	0	a	Because when you put this pen on the screen for exam and line is d being drawn at at two or three centimetres below .
76151	0	a	Yeah , it is useful , but
76152	0	a	No .
76153	0	a	Th the pen does not
76154	0	a	The line is a bit off .
76155	0	a	Yep .
76156	0	a	Alright .
76157	0	a	Yeah ,
76158	0	a	you can point to where you want the line to be .
76159	0	a	But
76160	0	a	Yeah .
76161	0	a	The project because of the deadlines you did not had the time to have , you did not have time to to make a very qualitati qualitative presentation .
76162	0	a	So you used this the different PowerPoint presentations
76163	0	a	in which you put your material in the
76164	0	a	Oh .
76165	0	a	That was not me .
76166	0	a	so
76167	0	a	the means , we discussed the smart board ,
76168	0	a	and what about this digital pen ?
76169	0	a	Yeah , well
76170	0	a	I use it as a a normal pen and and and only you use it to get it on the computer ,
76171	0	a	huh ?
76172	0	a	Yeah .
76173	0	a	Was not me .
76174	0	a	Yeah .
76175	0	a	I
76176	0	a	I
76177	0	a	I used it ,
76178	0	a	it it was
76179	0	a	you can use it , it is quite handy I think .
76180	0	a	I did not use it at all .
76181	0	a	But I did not
76182	0	a	I
76183	0	a	I used it too ,
76184	0	a	but
76185	0	a	oh well .
76186	0	a	Yeah ,
76187	0	a	I used it to y to
76188	0	a	Yeah , it did work pretty well .
76189	0	a	I did not use .
76190	0	a	Yeah .
76191	0	a	I do not think why you would want to use it actually ,
76192	0	a	but it it does work .
76193	0	a	Yeah ,
76194	0	a	because it shou
76195	0	a	To make some designs ,
76196	0	a	it is very easy .
76197	0	a	No yeah .
76198	0	a	It is it is
76199	0	a	yeah , it is easy for to design something and then load it in your computer .
76200	0	a	Yeah .
76201	0	a	Yeah ,
76202	0	a	and then you can show it to everybody .
76203	0	a	Yeah .
76204	0	a	But to write it th yeah .
76205	0	a	Yeah .
76206	0	a	It is b bi little bit too big to write .
76207	0	a	It does not really write normally .
76208	0	a	It is a bit
76209	0	a	Yeah .
76210	0	a	Yeah , it is too big , it is too fat .
76211	0	a	Yeah .
76212	0	a	Yeah .
76213	0	a	Fat document , those .
76214	0	a	Okay ,
76215	0	a	and what about the teamwork ?
76216	0	a	Yeah , well I think so too .
76217	0	a	Team work was okay .
76218	0	a	I think it was great ,
76219	0	a	yeah .
76220	0	a	Yeah .
76221	0	a	Only thing that we worked through , past each other .
76222	0	a	we
76223	0	a	Yeah ,
76224	0	a	but that was it was our assignment ,
76225	0	a	huh ?
76226	0	a	Okay ,
76227	1	a	and maybe I should walk out of the room when you discuss this point ,
76228	0	a	the leadership .
76229	0	a	Right .
76230	0	a	With some things that was only problem ,
76231	0	a	but
76232	0	a	Yeah
76233	0	a	yeah
76234	0	a	yeah ,
76235	1	a	but furthermore better .
76236	0	a	Yeah ,
76237	0	a	but it was because we did not
76238	0	a	Yeah .
76239	0	a	That is
76240	0	a	yeah , no prob .
76241	0	a	I thought it was good ,
76242	0	a	but Yeah .
76243	0	a	Yeah .
76244	0	a	Yeah
76245	0	a	well ,
76246	0	a	okay .
76247	0	a	Yeah .
76248	0	a	Not too much , not too too too too .
76249	0	a	Yeah .
76250	0	a	Yeah .
76251	0	a	Okay .
76252	0	a	And creativity ?
76253	0	a	Well ,
76254	0	a	when we look at this I would say we have been creative , huh ?
76255	0	a	But There was room for
76256	0	a	You did ?
76257	0	a	Well ,
76258	0	a	I did not have time for that .
76259	0	a	Well .
76260	0	a	Yeah ,
76261	0	a	or the room for
76262	0	a	it was the idea to be creative ,
76263	0	a	so
76264	0	a	You got some standard ideas in your head and this what came out .
76265	0	a	Yeah .
76266	0	a	And you get get stuff from the from the computer ,
76267	0	a	but
76268	0	a	Yeah .
76269	0	a	Yeah .
76270	0	a	The information was sometimes a little bit too late
76271	0	a	or
76272	0	a	Yeah .
76273	0	a	Little bit lo
76274	0	a	yeah .
76275	0	a	Too late
76276	0	a	it it
76277	0	a	it took a lot of time before you got your ema
76278	0	a	yeah .
76279	0	a	You just sit there for ten minutes .
76280	0	a	Yeah ,
76281	0	a	where is that email ?
76282	0	a	Oh
76283	0	a	did you ?
76284	0	a	Is it on there ?
76285	0	a	Is it on there ?
76286	0	a	I did not find the did not look but
76287	0	a	I did not look ,
76288	0	a	but
76289	0	a	I got like one email after ten minutes or something .
76290	0	a	I played I think seven times Solitaire something .
76291	0	a	Wha Oh right ,
76292	0	a	it is there .
76293	0	a	At some times I
76294	0	a	Sometimes I received like like five emails at at one moment ,
76295	0	a	and then
76296	0	a	I even got spam .
76297	0	a	Was searching and searching .
76298	0	a	No , I I never got that .
76299	0	a	I always N
76300	0	a	yeah .
76301	0	a	Or something like that .
76302	0	a	That is what we said .
76303	0	a	So does this
76304	0	a	I think lik oh and information was a bit low
76305	0	a	I think , sometimes ,
76306	0	a	in in in in the beginning I did not understand what what to do .
76307	0	a	And it not a lot
76308	0	a	No , the first one .
76309	0	a	No ,
76310	0	a	w I did not know Make a r
76311	0	a	yeah .
76312	0	a	Yeah ,
76313	0	a	like I with with the remote
76314	0	a	and I never new
76315	0	a	we have t
76316	0	a	we had to
76317	0	a	yeah made a made a rec a remote control .
76318	0	a	I did not know
76319	0	a	nee .
76320	0	a	And I did not know what to do for the first ten minutes before we got here , so I went , right .
76321	0	a	Yeah , so So ,
76322	0	a	yeah .
76323	0	a	Yeah .
76324	0	a	No stepping on the table and then looking at the internet page .
76325	0	a	Yeah .
76326	0	a	And I was working and working and work
76327	0	a	Okay , well
76328	0	a	but after all we can say we are satisfied , but it it could have been better .
76329	0	a	Just looking at the screen
76330	0	a	and
76331	0	a	Yeah ,
76332	0	a	an
76333	0	a	Yeah , that will be handy .
76334	0	a	No .
76335	0	a	Yeah .
76336	0	a	When we get when we have
76337	1	a	we would have gotten more information .
76338	0	a	Yeah ,
76339	1	a	more information about the costs .
76340	1	a	Faster .
76341	0	a	Yeah .
76342	0	a	First of all I did not think that we were able to make an LCD screen first point , but it was possible
76343	0	a	, yeah .
76344	0	a	Yeah .
76345	0	a	Yeah ,
76346	0	a	it only costs four units .
76347	0	a	yeah .
76348	0	a	Yea so
76349	0	a	tha
76350	0	a	actually you could make an LCD screen but no mic , or it could make mic but
76351	0	a	no LCD screen , when you look at that .
76352	0	a	Yeah .
76353	0	a	Yeah , that was a bit mean to put it in the end .
76354	0	a	Yeah .

76817	0	a	Why a cat ?
76818	0	a	You have some ?
76819	0	a	The pen ,
76820	0	a	yeah .
76821	0	a	yeah
76822	0	a	I dunno .
76823	0	a	They are my favourite pets .
76824	0	a	I have colour already .
76825	0	a	Yeah
76826	0	a	I am not so good at drawing with this kind of
76827	0	a	st
76828	0	a	Oh shit .
76829	0	a	Excuse my language .
76830	0	a	Sure .
76831	0	a	I do not know how to draw its face .
76832	0	a	But you get the idea .
76833	0	a	It is a cat .
76834	0	a	Yeah .
76835	0	a	It is my favourite pet animal , cause they are cute , they are independent and cuddly ,
76836	0	a	I dunno .
76837	0	a	Alright .
76838	0	a	Okay .
76839	0	a	That is it .
76840	0	a	Or do I need to use more colours
76841	0	a	and
76842	0	a	Alright .
76843	0	a	Yeah .
76844	0	a	I think it is okay .
76845	0	a	You get idea
76846	0	a	right ?
76847	0	a	Okay
76848	1	a	we have a financial aspect to this project .
76849	0	a	Yeah .
76850	0	a	we can sell them at twenty five Euros .
76851	0	a	the aim is to reach to sell as much as fifty million Euros .
76852	0	a	that is quite a big amount of money .
76853	0	a	And the production cost should be the half of the selling price .
76854	0	a	So we have to s
76855	0	a	Yeah .
76856	0	a	Okay
76857	1	a	now it is time for some discussion .
76858	0	a	Okay .
76859	0	a	Yeah .
76860	0	a	What what do you want to discuss ?
76861	0	a	Yep .
76862	1	a	We should get started .
76863	1	a	I am taking notes .
76864	0	a	Okay .
76865	0	a	Great .
76866	0	a	we each have a specific task , as I saw in my mail .
76867	0	a	I did not know if you received the same mail .
76868	0	a	Yeah .
76869	0	a	Yeah ?
76870	0	a	Okay so the
76871	0	a	this industrati Industrial Designer should produce a working design .
76872	0	a	Yeah .
76873	0	a	I guess so .
76874	0	a	Yeah .
76875	0	a	Am I correct ?
76876	0	a	Okay .
76877	0	a	True .
76878	0	a	the User Interface Designer should specify the technical functions .
76879	0	a	Right ?
76880	0	a	Yeah ?
76881	0	a	And the Marketing Expert should come up with user requirements .
76882	0	a	Yep .
76883	0	a	Yeah .
76884	0	a	did any of you already do some work on this part
76885	0	a	or
76886	0	a	Well
76887	0	a	I started making an overview for myself , what I had to do , cause we have three design steps and in every step I have a s specific task to perform or whatever .
76888	0	a	So I had to , I dunno , make an overview for myself about what I have to do , and kind of let it work in to get ideas about well how I have to fill it .
76889	1	a	And do you have any ideas about the product so far ?
76890	0	a	Well
76891	0	a	I started I started with the first phase , I think was the functional .
76892	0	a	And let is see
76893	0	a	I had to focus on the working design , which you said .
76894	0	a	How does the apparatus work ?
76895	0	a	And well
76896	0	a	I basically had two points .
76897	0	a	according to the coffee machine example , I have batteries to supply energy , and we use button presses to activate or deactivate certain functions on the TV .
76898	0	a	Yeah .
76899	0	a	Yeah .
76900	0	a	Okay .
76901	0	a	And that is basically all I have so far .
76902	0	a	Yeah
76903	1	a	I got another point .
76904	0	a	It uses infrared light to communicate the signal to the TV apparatus or stereo .
76905	0	a	Yeah .
76906	0	a	Wireless huh .
76907	0	a	Yeah .
76908	0	a	Yeah .
76909	0	a	Alright .
76910	0	a	Yeah .
76911	0	a	So
76912	0	a	that is very common .
76913	0	a	it is some buttons for for the on off function .
76914	0	a	You d you already told that .
76915	0	a	And for the changing up to the to all the channels and changing the volume .
76916	0	a	That are the the basic options for a remote control .
76917	0	a	Yeah .
76918	0	a	Yeah
76919	0	a	I kept it global
76920	0	a	cause
76921	0	a	that it activates or deactivates specific functions , cause I was not thinking yet about that .
76922	0	a	Okay , yeah .
76923	0	a	I mean , you want to ch
76924	0	a	ch flip the channel but you might want to use teletext also .
76925	0	a	Yeah .
76926	0	a	Yep .
76927	0	a	Yeah .
76928	0	a	I dunno what the word is in English .
76929	0	a	Yeah .
76930	0	a	Same I believe .
76931	0	a	Yeah .
76932	0	a	and what did the Marketing Expert do ?
76933	0	a	well
76934	0	a	from a marketing perspective , well the function des design phase consists out of the user requirements .
76935	0	a	what needs and desires are to be fulfilled ?
76936	0	a	So
76937	0	a	there are a few means to reach that by by doing research to see what existing products are there out in the market .
76938	0	a	I mean , what functions do they have .
76939	0	a	especially what are their shortcomings ?
76940	0	a	Are there any new functions which can be added to our product ?
76941	1	a	therefore we have to to do some internet search .
76942	0	a	Yep .
76943	1	a	For example for well what kind of applications do current remote controls support , and what are f featur features of current and future televisions ?
76944	0	a	So we can see what needs to be supported .
76945	0	a	Yes .
76946	1	a	and we can interview current users and future users .
76947	1	a	What w what would they like to see on a new remote control ? especially for future users , I am thinking of early adopters ,
76948	0	a	because they they use new technology first , and they play with a lot of tools and stuff
76949	0	a	so maybe they have some good ideas to to add .
76950	0	a	Okay .
76951	0	a	Okay .
76952	0	a	Okay .
76953	0	a	And you can get that information ?
76954	0	a	Okay .
76955	0	a	I think I can get that information , yeah .
76956	0	a	That would be very handy .
76957	0	a	So
76958	0	a	yeah .
76959	0	a	but have you any idea so far as what the user requirements are ?
76960	0	a	No ?
76961	0	a	No okay .
76962	0	a	No n not specifically .
76963	0	a	More to how to get them
76964	0	a	and
76965	0	a	Yeah ?
76966	0	a	Yeah .
76967	0	a	I got some requirements it has it has to be user friendly .
76968	0	a	Yeah ?
76969	0	a	Of course .
76970	0	a	Obviously .
76971	1	a	really easy to use buttons , not not very small buttons , but not the the also the big big buttons , but just normal buttons .
76972	1	a	It has to be a small unit .
76973	0	a	It has to be
76974	0	a	yeah ,
76975	0	a	you can take it with you everywhere in in your house .
76976	1	a	So it has n has not to be l yeah , gigantic machine .
76977	0	a	Big ,
76978	0	a	Yeah .
76979	1	a	and a and a good zapping range .
76980	0	a	what do you mean by that ?
76981	0	a	Okay
76982	0	a	Well
76983	0	a	I do not think I have anything more to add at the moment .
76984	0	a	Yeah .
76985	1	a	the distance from your television to your remote control has to be , yeah
76986	1	a	yeah ,
76987	1	a	quite a big distance .
76988	0	a	Yeah .
76989	1	a	It has to be capable for zapping
76990	0	a	Yeah .
76991	0	a	From the other end of the room or something ?
76992	0	a	Yeah .
76993	1	a	I think the best is to go to work .
76994	0	a	Whoa .
76995	0	a	Is that you
76996	0	a	or
76997	0	a	alright .
76998	0	a	Yeah .
76999	0	a	Okay .
77000	0	a	Any more points to discuss ?
77001	0	a	Alright .
77002	0	a	Yeah .
77003	1	a	I think we can go ahead with what we have .
77004	1	a	I will summarise the things we discussed and put it in the project folder .
77005	0	a	the use of the Industrial Designer can work on the working design , etcetera etcetera .
77006	0	a	And it seems you get more information by email .
77007	0	a	So
77008	0	a	that was it for me .
77009	0	a	Alright .
77010	0	a	Okay .
77011	0	a	Kay .
77012	0	a	Thanks .
77013	0	a	Yeah , in the project folder .
77014	0	a	Are you going to put the the notes on the
77015	0	a	Okay .
77016	0	a	Yeah .
77017	0	a	The pro okay .
77018	0	a	Yeah .
77019	0	a	Alright .
77020	0	a	I am writing very fast .
77021	0	a	Yeah .
77022	0	a	Yeah .
77023	0	a	Okay .
77024	0	a	Hope it is readable .
77025	0	a	Yep .
77026	0	a	Okay
77027	0	a	anything more you want to add to the discussion ?
77028	0	a	Yeah .
77029	0	a	I guess so .
77030	0	a	Well
77031	0	a	no
77032	0	a	I am just a bit wondering what we are going to do the next session ?
77033	0	a	Yeah okay .
77034	0	a	Yeah .
77035	0	a	Do we only have to to do phase one , the functional design ?
77036	0	a	After that we are going to the conceptual
77037	0	a	Okay .
77038	0	a	Because then we have a
77039	0	a	Yeah .
77040	0	a	Yeah .
77041	0	a	We are just working the three phases .
77042	0	a	Y you do some individual work , we have meeting , individual work , meeting .
77043	0	a	And at the end of the day we have a final meeting .
77044	0	a	And then I have to prepare I have to defend our design ,
77045	1	a	so make it good .
77046	0	a	Okay .
77047	0	a	We will do our best .
77048	0	a	I depend on you .
77049	0	a	Better make it
77050	0	a	Yeah .
77051	1	a	I am going to work on the conceptual design already
77052	0	a	cause
77053	0	a	yeah
77054	0	a	it is fairly important to know what kind of components we want to put in .
77055	0	a	Yeah ?
77056	0	a	If you can mix it it is okay .
77057	0	a	Yeah .
77058	0	a	Do we
77059	0	a	I mean , is it going to be a multimedia control centre ?
77060	0	a	Do we want to be able to use the video recorder with it ?
77061	0	a	Yeah .
77062	0	a	Yeah .
77063	0	a	That is my question also
77064	0	a	because like new new functions
77065	0	a	Requirements .
77066	0	a	Well
77067	0	a	I think that is the user requirements part .
77068	0	a	Yeah .
77069	0	a	As to what they want .
77070	0	a	True .
77071	0	a	do they want all those functions on that small
77072	0	a	Yeah .
77073	0	a	Yeah .
77074	0	a	But but we need good communication about this stuff , cause I have to f put the components into the design .
77075	0	a	Unit .
77076	0	a	Yeah .
77077	0	a	I would first m
77078	0	a	Yeah .
77079	0	a	So if I do not know what components to put in , it is kind of hard .
77080	0	a	Yeah well
77081	0	a	I
77082	0	a	I was
77083	0	a	Yeah
77084	0	a	well
77085	0	a	like l li like some like some some remotes who are out there , which I know , there is one button which is very easy to switch between devices .
77086	0	a	Yeah I understand .
77087	1	a	I I think we have first to start with the basic functions and we can expand them .
77088	0	a	You can always add a few
77089	0	a	Yeah .
77090	0	a	So you can switch to your video and then the same buttons control your video .
77091	0	a	the CD player .
77092	0	a	Yeah .
77093	0	a	Yeah .
77094	1	a	And another function I will think of switch to your media centre ,
77095	0	a	because that is getting very popular .
77096	0	a	Yeah
77097	0	a	so
77098	0	a	Okay .
77099	0	a	And then use your Windows media centre under your TV with the same remote control .
77100	0	a	Yeah .
77101	0	a	So with the switch , one single switch
77102	0	a	S
77103	0	a	Yeah
77104	0	a	records and stuff like that .
77105	0	a	Yeah I
77106	0	a	I know what you mean ,
77107	0	a	but you will ne need several other buttons for a video player .
77108	0	a	Okay .
77109	0	a	You need a play and a forw fast forward and a stop function .
77110	0	a	And you you do not need that for a TV .
77111	0	a	Okay .
77112	0	a	No .
77113	0	a	And and for a t teletext you need additional buttons as well , so I kind of need to know what we need .
77114	0	a	You need additional
77115	0	a	yeah .
77116	0	a	Yeah .
77117	0	a	Yeah .
77118	0	a	Yeah .
77119	0	a	Yeah .
77120	0	a	Yeah .
77121	1	a	Whatever , I will just put my ideas in in here
77122	1	a	and then we can discuss it with the next meeting .
77123	0	a	In the project
77124	0	a	Yeah .
77125	0	a	Yeah .
77126	1	a	We could just start with the assumption that is only for TV and video .
77127	1	a	And reserve the possibility to add other features .
77128	0	a	Okay .
77129	0	a	So we have a basic starting point and you can always extend that
77130	1	a	so make sure it is extendible .
77131	0	a	Okay .
77132	0	a	Yeah
77133	0	a	it it has
77134	0	a	yeah
77135	0	a	it has to be user friendly .
77136	0	a	Yeah .
77137	0	a	Alright .
77138	1	a	Yeah .
77139	0	a	So it is has not it is
77140	0	a	yeah .
77141	1	a	Th the least amount of functions possible
77142	0	a	so it is easier to get to know how it works etcetera .
77143	0	a	Yeah .
77144	0	a	Okay .
77145	0	a	Yeah .
77146	0	a	Yeah .
77147	0	a	I understand .
77148	0	a	Yeah .
77149	0	a	Yeah .
77150	0	a	Yeah ?
77151	0	a	Okay
77152	0	a	and I will see you again when the computer tells us to .
77153	0	a	Alright .
77154	0	a	Yes .
77155	0	a	Yeah .
77156	0	a	Can we leave now
77157	0	a	or
77158	0	a	Half an hour .
77159	0	a	Yeah , you are di dismissed .
77160	0	a	Thanks .
77161	0	a	You are fired .

77250	0	a	Format save .
77251	0	a	So it does not draw the attention away .
77252	0	a	This is dreadful .
77253	0	a	Yeah .
77254	0	a	I made my own map .
77255	0	a	No not this , but the task .
77256	0	a	Oh yeah sure .
77257	0	a	It is a
77258	0	a	Yeah .
77259	0	a	You have Playstation also ?
77260	0	a	Huh .
77261	0	a	Yeah .
77262	0	a	No that is okay .
77263	0	a	No I just flapped it , closed it , took it here
77264	0	a	and then this happened .
77265	0	a	where was it ?
77266	0	a	In settings ?
77267	0	a	Okay .
77268	0	a	Alright .
77269	0	a	Thank you .
77270	0	a	Do you guys like your tasks ?
77271	0	a	I spent a lot of time thinking about what I was going to do and then a couple of minutes before this
77272	0	a	I get my function you know the information that I need .
77273	0	a	Yeah .
77274	0	a	Yeah .
77275	0	a	Yeah wa wa you actually
77276	0	a	Yeah .
77277	0	a	Yeah .
77278	0	a	So frustrating .
77279	0	a	But it it is not clear what you have to to to type type in your presentation .
77280	0	a	So
77281	0	a	Yeah
77282	0	a	Yeah exactly .
77283	0	a	Yeah .
77284	0	a	I I had a whole idea and then just was typing it
77285	0	a	and then
77286	0	a	oh .
77287	0	a	I have to do that so switch .
77288	0	a	This presentation is mainly based on my own ideas cause I had not time to intergrate tha the information yet so
77289	0	a	Really annoying .
77290	0	a	Yeah .
77291	0	a	Okay .
77292	0	a	So there we are again .
77293	0	a	By your humble PM .
77294	0	a	Yeah .
77295	0	a	Okay this is the agenda .
77296	0	a	we have three presentations , I heard .
77297	0	a	Really .
77298	0	a	Yeah really .
77299	1	a	So who wants to start ?
77300	0	a	Yeah .
77301	1	a	Yeah that is fine .
77302	0	a	Yeah .
77303	0	a	We have to start it right away ?
77304	0	a	Functional ?
77305	0	a	Yeah functional requirements .
77306	0	a	this is you ?
77307	0	a	Kay .
77308	0	a	Alright .
77309	1	a	I am going to talk about functional requirements .
77310	0	a	Well some research has be done has been done .
77311	0	a	observing of one hundred subjects in the usability lab using a remote control .
77312	0	a	and they also filled in a questionnaire .
77313	0	a	The findings were , well you can see them for yourself .
77314	0	a	They disliked the look and feel of current remotes controls .
77315	0	a	Users think they are ugly .
77316	0	a	they do not match the the operating behaviour of the users .
77317	0	a	So they they d they do not match what they want to have on it .
77318	0	a	they are often lost somewhere in the room .
77319	0	a	it takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote control .
77320	0	a	And they are bad for RSI .
77321	0	a	I do not know how a user can reach that
77322	0	a	but okay .
77323	0	a	there is also was also some research on the most relevant and and and irrelevant f functions .
77324	0	a	Ts
77325	0	a	So they do need to be in the
77326	0	a	Alright .
77327	0	a	most irrelevant and less used were audio settings , mono , stereo , pitch , bass .
77328	0	a	screen settings for brightness and colour and stuff like that .
77329	0	a	but they are used .
77330	0	a	I mean the
77331	0	a	Yeah they do need to be on the on the remote control .
77332	0	a	Yeah .
77333	0	a	I mean if you ca not control the the sound settings
77334	0	a	I mean if you dislike a very loud bass or something , you you need to change that .
77335	0	a	So yeah we have to .
77336	0	a	often .
77337	0	a	By the way my TV does not have an equ equaliser but
77338	0	a	okay .
77339	0	a	We c
77340	0	a	we c
77341	0	a	Yeah
77342	0	a	I mean w we ca not
77343	0	a	my my TV has ,
77344	1	a	but we we can leave them away .
77345	0	a	Next generation does .
77346	0	a	No .
77347	0	a	Alright .
77348	0	a	most relevant , most used functions ,
77349	0	a	they speak for themselves I guess .
77350	0	a	power button , channel , volume selection .
77351	0	a	teletext
77352	0	a	but we can skip that because I saw the newsflash , and teletext is so outdated that it it is i should not be used any more in the future .
77353	0	a	N not used anymore .
77354	0	a	So forget this one .
77355	0	a	Okay .
77356	0	a	channel settings , so for programming your channels in in the right order .
77357	0	a	By the way where did you guys get that newsflash from ?
77358	0	a	I did not get anything .
77359	0	a	Yeah .
77360	0	a	Yeah .
77361	0	a	Yeah , on on the project
77362	0	a	No
77363	0	a	so it is a text file n in the project folder .
77364	0	a	I was wondering
77365	0	a	But you you have got more information than .
77366	0	a	Yeah .
77367	0	a	Not by mail .
77368	0	a	I receiv the mail but you do not .
77369	0	a	So That is in the presentation , so below I believe .
77370	0	a	So teletext can be skipped .
77371	0	a	Alright .
77372	0	a	there was some research on new features in a remote control .
77373	0	a	about an LCD screen and speech recognition .
77374	0	a	Well we got an update for the for the audience .
77375	0	a	Or the the the targeted group .
77376	0	a	So it is above forty I guess .
77377	0	a	The new product ?
77378	0	a	Or below
77379	0	a	because that is pretty relevant .
77380	0	a	Yeah below forty .
77381	0	a	I thought I read a
77382	0	a	Yeah ?
77383	0	a	Below ?
77384	0	a	Okay well that is that is in the newsfla
77385	0	a	okay
77386	0	a	that is a good to know .
77387	0	a	Our current customers are in the age group forty plus .
77388	0	a	And the new product should reach new markets , which is the customers below forty .
77389	0	a	But where did you get that information ?
77390	0	a	Okay .
77391	0	a	That is in a newsflash .
77392	0	a	because you see see a clear distinction between the age groups , concerning the features .
77393	0	a	Yeah .
77394	0	a	I mean above forty people are not so interested not so interested in a screen or speech recognition .
77395	0	a	but below that age they they pretty much are .
77396	1	a	So I think we can build that in .
77397	0	a	Yeah well we can skip this part as well , because I thought I read above forty
77398	0	a	so we could skip the features ,
77399	1	a	but we just have to build them in because they find it very interesting .
77400	1	a	well we have to keep all the classic functions but make the buttons as user friendly as possible .
77401	0	a	and and also there is
77402	0	a	so not only the design of the bus buttons but o how you can push them , and stuff like that .
77403	0	a	So the physical aspect of it .
77404	0	a	And I think and certainly for for the for the lower age groups , nice design , which does not make the remote control in your room .
77405	0	a	It is it is actually a part of your interior , of of your design in your room .
77406	0	a	Yeah .
77407	0	a	So it is the people can say , well what is that , well that is my remote control , so it is d it has to look nice and feel nice , and and have all the functions that
77408	0	a	Yeah
77409	0	a	so the the logo has to be
77410	0	a	present
77411	0	a	yeah , and the colours as well .
77412	0	a	Yeah .
77413	0	a	But it also needs to have corporate identity .
77414	0	a	Present and the colours .
77415	0	a	So we ca not change much of that .
77416	0	a	Do we have
77417	0	a	yeah .
77418	0	a	Yeah
77419	0	a	so
77420	0	a	but I
77421	0	a	I do not think that is that is a problem because the thing has to have a colour anyway , and most of the times there is a brand present on it .
77422	0	a	Yeah .
77423	0	a	So I think that is not going to going to affect it very very much .
77424	0	a	Yeah .
77425	0	a	Okay .
77426	0	a	Well that are the the consequences on a marketing part .
77427	0	a	Alright .
77428	0	a	Yes .
77429	0	a	Okay .
77430	0	a	Kay .
77431	0	a	It is open already so you can use to find yours .
77432	0	a	It is
77433	0	a	F five .
77434	0	a	F five .
77435	0	a	Okay .
77436	0	a	Oh .
77437	0	a	Go Jurgen .
77438	0	a	What is this ?
77439	0	a	Oh no .
77440	0	a	How do I
77441	0	a	No no no .
77442	0	a	You pressed alt F four ?
77443	0	a	Oh great .
77444	0	a	I pressed the mouse button .
77445	0	a	It is th
77446	0	a	that is the self destruct button .
77447	0	a	Yeah .
77448	0	a	Yeah .
77449	1	a	maybe you can do it from your computer so talk us through it .
77450	0	a	Okay .
77451	1	a	Okay .
77452	0	a	Yeah .
77453	1	a	if you all go stand around Computer
77454	0	a	No .
77455	0	a	Just
77456	0	a	yeah .
77457	0	a	Yeah .
77458	1	a	Sure .
77459	1	a	Alright .
77460	0	a	That is nice .
77461	0	a	F five .
77462	0	a	Yeah .
77463	0	a	Yeah .
77464	0	a	Okay .
77465	0	a	Alright .
77466	0	a	I had two examples .
77467	0	a	this one is the the
77468	0	a	yeah
77469	0	a	the advanced one with a lot of options and functions and buttons .
77470	0	a	This the easy one
77471	1	a	I think we have to to combine them .
77472	0	a	Yeah .
77473	0	a	Yeah .
77474	1	a	And yeah merge the best functions of all examples .
77475	0	a	Yeah .
77476	0	a	but yeah the the age is under forty ?
77477	0	a	So we
77478	0	a	Okay so so we have the option for more functions .
77479	0	a	The yeah .
77480	0	a	Yeah and and and marketing research stated that that that kind of users are not afraid of of a lot of functions .
77481	0	a	So not not too much
77482	0	a	but
77483	0	a	yeah .
77484	0	a	yeah .
77485	0	a	And we do have to integrate the screen and the the speech
77486	0	a	alright .
77487	0	a	And the speech recognition
77488	0	a	yeah .
77489	0	a	Yeah .
77490	0	a	Yeah .
77491	0	a	yeah this this one we can remove for kids .
77492	0	a	It is just only for adults so we can use some advanced options .
77493	0	a	Yeah from age of sixteen
77494	0	a	so
77495	0	a	yeah .
77496	0	a	But
77497	1	a	Yeah
77498	1	a	but I prefer we we use the the basic options
77499	1	a	yeah .
77500	1	a	We have to to make them very easy so for just zapping around the channels you can just push one button .
77501	1	a	But if you want to to use your your video recorder or something else , you should use use an an advanced option .
77502	0	a	Yeah but the the newsflash also stated that it should control only one device , only your television .
77503	0	a	Okay one device .
77504	0	a	Yeah .
77505	0	a	Okay .
77506	0	a	So n it is very easy .
77507	0	a	So w
77508	0	a	So there are not extra options in this case , but
77509	0	a	Yeah .
77510	0	a	I did not see .
77511	0	a	Now yeah it is okay .
77512	0	a	Okay
77513	0	a	and I also
77514	0	a	yeah .
77515	0	a	Okay .
77516	0	a	W
77517	0	a	yeah .
77518	1	a	We have to make it fashionable .
77519	1	a	Like you said before .
77520	0	a	Yeah .
77521	0	a	yeah the basic functions .
77522	0	a	yeah only use a extra function if they are really needed .
77523	0	a	Yeah
77524	1	a	so maybe you can hide them or something .
77525	0	a	Yeah .
77526	0	a	Yeah .
77527	1	a	Yeah well what what we can do with the screen is is all the the configuration options , you can put that in the screen .
77528	0	a	Yeah you make a screen menu or something .
77529	0	a	And the and the
77530	0	a	yeah screen menu to to to to do that ,
77531	1	a	and then the basic function just on the device itself .
77532	0	a	Yeah .
77533	0	a	Yeah .
77534	0	a	So it looks very simple and all the advanced features are hidden in the screen , with a clear menu .
77535	0	a	Yeah
77536	0	a	and the other oth other functionality is the screen .
77537	0	a	Yeah .
77538	0	a	What does the screen do ?
77539	0	a	Yeah .
77540	0	a	Alright .
77541	0	a	Did I
77542	0	a	did I break it ?
77543	0	a	For for the advanced functions I think .
77544	0	a	What are wh
77545	0	a	What .
77546	0	a	It is low power .
77547	0	a	So what does the screen do ?
77548	0	a	They said they needed it but what does it do ?
77549	0	a	What do they want with the screen ?
77550	0	a	Yeah that is what we make it up .
77551	0	a	Yeah well it
77552	0	a	yeah
77553	0	a	it did not
77554	0	a	it did not say what they want to do with the screen .
77555	0	a	So but what did the marketing
77556	0	a	No .
77557	0	a	Well I , my guess is it is it is pretty handy for advanced advanced functions .
77558	0	a	Yeah okay it is handy .
77559	0	a	With no predefined
77560	0	a	We are back online .
77561	0	a	Like searching for channels and
77562	0	a	Yeah .
77563	0	a	Yeah searching for channels , programming them .
77564	0	a	look .
77565	0	a	We have your
77566	0	a	oh never mind .
77567	0	a	Okay .
77568	0	a	That is
77569	0	a	I am al I am almost finished so
77570	0	a	the
77571	0	a	we have to to to watch out for the i if we make it f very fashionable , it it the functional functionality will go down .
77572	0	a	Okay .
77573	1	a	So we have to make a compromise between functionality and fashional fashionable
77574	0	a	yeah content and form .
77575	0	a	Content and form .
77576	0	a	Yeah .
77577	0	a	Yeah .
77578	0	a	Now that that was was the end .
77579	0	a	That was the end .
77580	0	a	Yeah .
77581	0	a	Okay .
77582	0	a	Yes .
77583	0	a	Okay .
77584	0	a	Well my presentation is a bit sucky .
77585	1	a	Well you can improvise right ?
77586	0	a	So we we can go for
77587	1	a	So we can go for the look and feel of the the left example , and then a screen on top of it .
77588	0	a	which one is it ?
77589	0	a	Technical functions ?
77590	0	a	This one ?
77591	0	a	Functional requirements ?
77592	0	a	No .
77593	0	a	Yeah a little bit .
77594	0	a	no .
77595	0	a	No no .
77596	0	a	Yeah I think that would be it then .
77597	0	a	I have no idea .
77598	0	a	You did not put it in ?
77599	0	a	Or
77600	0	a	it is not really English .
77601	0	a	That w .
77602	1	a	Let me check .
77603	0	a	I know .
77604	0	a	kick off .
77605	0	a	Oh working design I got it .
77606	0	a	Yeah .
77607	0	a	Here you go .
77608	0	a	Alright how do I skip pages ?
77609	0	a	The keys
77610	0	a	yeah ?
77611	0	a	Alright .
77612	0	a	Just press
77613	0	a	yeah .
77614	0	a	Yeah .
77615	0	a	Yeah .
77616	0	a	yeah
77617	0	a	well I was working on this before I got my information .
77618	0	a	So I was just working off the top of my head and using my colin common knowledge about remote controls .
77619	0	a	And well the info on the website which came too late .
77620	0	a	so I did not really know what kind of functions we had to put into it yet .
77621	0	a	So this is basically an overview of what we discussed in our last meeting .
77622	0	a	Those were my starting points .
77623	0	a	I was working on a s
77624	0	a	yeah
77625	0	a	on a schedule ,
77626	0	a	and I was supposed to do it like this .
77627	0	a	But yeah then the information came and it was kind of exact with all the steps in the remote control that I had to follow , so I was trying to organise them for myself .
77628	0	a	And then make the
77629	0	a	the design , a the actual design ,
77630	0	a	but I never came around to do that .
77631	0	a	Design ?
77632	0	a	Yeah .
77633	0	a	Design yeah .
77634	0	a	So I am not really sure what I am supposed to say about it .
77635	0	a	Okay .
77636	0	a	I mean everything speaks for itself I guess .
77637	0	a	Mean you press a button the it tru goes , it sends a signal to a chip , which translates it into infrared signal of certin spatial frequencies .
77638	0	a	Yeah frequency .
77639	0	a	Yeah .
77640	0	a	And or temporal fr frequencies actually .
77641	0	a	And then through a transformer , it the signal gets boosted and then sent to the to the receiver on the TV and the TV will translate it into a function .
77642	0	a	Yeah decoder .
77643	0	a	Yeah well this was actually all I got around to do .
77644	0	a	Blank .
77645	0	a	Yeah okay .
77646	0	a	I mean I dunno if I am too slow for this stuff ,
77647	0	a	but Yeah .
77648	0	a	Yeah .
77649	0	a	Yeah .
77650	0	a	Work harder .
77651	1	a	Okay shou should we make a list of the of all the functions we want
77652	0	a	Yeah .
77653	0	a	Whatever .
77654	0	a	Yeah .
77655	0	a	Kay .
77656	0	a	Yeah we want to incorporate in into it .
77657	0	a	for those that did not see yet the basic new requirements of the management were no teletext , only for TV .
77658	0	a	it should be designed for a use g group below forty , but I do not think it is w wrong if we can target the current customer group as well .
77659	0	a	And the corporate identity should be clear in the design of the remote control .
77660	0	a	And we have to decide on the functions , and on the , let is see what was it , the target group .
77661	0	a	We have to make be clear what that is .
77662	0	a	group of users , or
77663	0	a	because it says below forty I mean .
77664	0	a	Yeah users .
77665	0	a	Yeah so I think it is easy but
77666	0	a	Yeah it is below forty
77667	0	a	so we can decide
77668	0	a	where to
77669	0	a	Okay .
77670	0	a	I guess that is that is the tar yeah or male and female
77671	0	a	six
77672	0	a	the marketing research started on s on the age of sixteen .
77673	0	a	But it is it is also for children or just
77674	0	a	Okay .
77675	0	a	Sixteen to twenty five , twenty five to thirty five , thirty five to forty five , something like that .
77676	0	a	Okay .
77677	0	a	So
77678	0	a	How do you mean ?
77679	0	a	sixteen to forty .
77680	0	a	So below forty is okay .
77681	1	a	But we need an lower level which to s focus .
77682	0	a	So is it from sixteen to forty ?
77683	0	a	Is it from twenty to forty ?
77684	0	a	Is it from thirty ?
77685	0	a	Yeah ?
77686	0	a	Kay .
77687	0	a	Yeah .
77688	0	a	Well I I guess people of sixteen are are quite used to technology .
77689	0	a	We we have to
77690	0	a	And if we have a larger public we have yeah more options to to sell our product .
77691	0	a	Yeah .
77692	0	a	So they they adapt to it pretty soon I guess .
77693	0	a	Yeah .
77694	1	a	Yeah so what we might want to do is
77695	1	a	yeah
77696	1	a	cust
77697	1	a	I have customised the screen functions , if you know what I mean .
77698	0	a	The younger users are more acquainted with these kind of machines so they can use more advanced functions .
77699	0	a	But maybe elderly people do not understand it so well , so they need a simpler remote .
77700	0	a	Design .
77701	1	a	And yeah that you can choose what the design displays , or wha whatever .
77702	0	a	Yeah that is that is why I wanted to to make
77703	0	a	yeah
77704	0	a	two different
77705	0	a	yeah
77706	0	a	groups of functions .
77707	1	a	The the simple functions for for the the whole public , and the the advanced options for the younger people
77708	1	a	yeah who are
77709	1	a	more yeah
77710	1	a	experienced with
77711	0	a	Na
77712	1	a	I w I should put the the
77713	1	a	yeah
77714	1	a	the extra advanced options on the onto the onscreen display .
77715	0	a	Yeah .
77716	0	a	Experienced yeah .
77717	0	a	And maybe y
77718	0	a	Yeah .
77719	1	a	But all incorporated in the screen or or just on the remote itself ?
77720	0	a	Yeah
77721	1	a	like like you have a visual of the of the brightness with with a kind of sliding bar and a bus and and stuff like that for sound and and vis and and visuals ?
77722	1	a	you can make a if you make a drawing .
77723	0	a	Yeah .
77724	0	a	Yeah .
77725	0	a	Yeah .
77726	1	a	So is you should have a menu for all the the functions you do not use regular and which are
77727	1	a	Yeah .
77728	0	a	Yeah .
77729	1	a	Aye
77730	1	a	yeah .
77731	0	a	Shall I
77732	0	a	Yeah .
77733	0	a	black is okay .
77734	0	a	And draw it very big .
77735	0	a	Oh .
77736	0	a	It is okay .
77737	0	a	Yeah .
77738	0	a	no , it does not have line control , so
77739	0	a	Yeah we get the The remote , yeah ?
77740	0	a	Basic .
77741	0	a	Yeah .
77742	0	a	Yeah well , this is basically it is
77743	0	a	alright the remote ?
77744	0	a	well usually the power button is on top I guess .
77745	0	a	The remote ?
77746	1	a	Right top .
77747	0	a	Is on top .
77748	0	a	Which should be easy , easily reached with the thumb .
77749	0	a	Yeah
77750	0	a	so it should fit right in into your hand .
77751	0	a	Yeah .
77752	1	a	L left top or right top ?
77753	0	a	Yeah , right .
77754	1	a	Right .
77755	1	a	T
77756	1	a	I s
77757	1	a	should said right .
77758	1	a	Right .
77759	0	a	I most people are right handed so
77760	1	a	maybe left handed special addition , but okay .
77761	0	a	Okay .
77762	0	a	Yeah definitely .
77763	1	a	If you put it like like here .
77764	1	a	Or something .
77765	0	a	I dunno .
77766	1	a	then you could put a screen , like on a mobile phone , also on top I guess .
77767	0	a	Yeah but if you are using the the normal functions , the the basic functions , you normally press them on the u
77768	0	a	yeah .
77769	0	a	Do the also with the thumb .
77770	1	a	So it should be a little bit longer so that you can put your thumb , also reach the middle .
77771	1	a	Or you should screen at the bottom
77772	1	a	and then you can see it very clearly .
77773	0	a	Okay
77774	0	a	so y
77775	0	a	yeah
77776	0	a	you have you have it in your hand , and the screen is below , and the buttons are in the middle .
77777	0	a	You you need to be able to hold it so
77778	0	a	Yeah .
77779	0	a	Yeah .
77780	1	a	Okay for example if you put the screen here ,
77781	0	a	it is more about the functions now than the than the layout .
77782	0	a	Yeah okay that is true .
77783	0	a	Layout .
77784	0	a	That is for the
77785	0	a	I ca not help it .
77786	0	a	Does not work too well .
77787	0	a	It is it is bent .
77788	0	a	You broke it .
77789	0	a	Yeah .
77790	0	a	Yeah .
77791	0	a	Man .
77792	0	a	Right .
77793	0	a	Yeah okay .
77794	0	a	Okay you get it .
77795	0	a	for example if y if you put all the
77796	0	a	Right .
77797	0	a	You want the normal piece of paper ?
77798	0	a	And you have a pen ?
77799	0	a	Yeah ?
77800	0	a	Yeah .
77801	0	a	And might be easier huh ?
77802	0	a	Yeah I
77803	0	a	Yeah exactly .
77804	0	a	Maybe this .
77805	0	a	kind of works .
77806	0	a	Like if you have like ten buttons for for all the for all the channels ,
77807	1	a	and here one for for
77808	0	a	Yeah
77809	0	a	that that usually like here , here , here , here .
77810	1	a	And the for flipping up and down .
77811	0	a	Yeah yeah .
77812	1	a	And volume control .
77813	0	a	Yeah .
77814	0	a	So you have up and down for the for the channels , and left and right for the volume
77815	0	a	Yeah .
77816	0	a	Yeah .
77817	0	a	And left to right .
77818	1	a	And those can also be used for the menu .
77819	1	a	I thought but this is really your department , that we need just the functional display and four cursors .
77820	0	a	Yeah .
77821	0	a	Yeah .
77822	0	a	Yeah okay
77823	0	a	but this is function
77824	0	a	so if you can use them for multiple things For the menu .
77825	0	a	And you you have
77826	0	a	most of the time you have one button in the middle .
77827	0	a	And
77828	0	a	Yeah okay .
77829	0	a	It says menu , and then if you press it you the screen gets activated and then you can use these buttons to scroll up and down and left and right to go into functon
77830	0	a	and then just
77831	0	a	mo most of the time this menu button is also like okay , to to confirm a a kind of action .
77832	0	a	Yeah .
77833	0	a	Yeah .
77834	0	a	Yeah .
77835	0	a	Yeah .
77836	0	a	So you scroll into it , okay .
77837	0	a	You select a function like v like bass .
77838	0	a	You just adjust it with these two buttons .
77839	0	a	Yeah .
77840	0	a	Then okay to confirm , and then on on each on each screen there is there should be an option to go back to a to a upper level .
77841	0	a	And then finally say okay , exit .
77842	0	a	Or or one button to exit it .
77843	0	a	Yeah .
77844	0	a	in one time I dunno , that is not really my department .
77845	0	a	That is more your your department to to to
77846	0	a	Yeah .
77847	0	a	And do we need a a logo on our remote control , or
77848	1	a	On the left top yeah .
77849	0	a	Yeah .
77850	1	a	But it should be if the screen is here then the logo should be like on on top ,
77851	0	a	yeah .
77852	0	a	I mean it is
77853	0	a	Yeah .
77854	0	a	Okay .
77855	0	a	Yeah but that depends on where you put the screen .
77856	0	a	But it is essential that there is a screen .
77857	0	a	Yeah I mean the position of the screen is also more essential than
77858	1	a	I mean we we look where we have space left and then put the logo over there .
77859	0	a	Yeah .
77860	0	a	And for the speech recognition part , if we want to incorporate that , we need a microphone .
77861	0	a	But
77862	0	a	Yeah
77863	0	a	so it should be
77864	1	a	I mean if you have it in your hand here , should be on top somewhere , maybe .
77865	0	a	Yeah .
77866	0	a	This would be
77867	0	a	No that is not s sure so we need a display .
77868	0	a	Why did we want to put the display in the bottom ?
77869	0	a	Okay .
77870	0	a	I mean i
77871	0	a	That is not sure
77872	0	a	but it is
77873	0	a	Yeah I mean a screen on top looks more lo logical to me .
77874	0	a	Yeah may maybe because you are
77875	0	a	Yeah okay but only for the basic functi
77876	0	a	if you are going to use the advanced option , you are going to press the the menu button
77877	0	a	and then yeah .
77878	0	a	Because yeah if you use the functions your hand will block the display .
77879	0	a	Normal for logical t
77880	0	a	Yeah .
77881	0	a	Also because people use m mobile phones and they also have the screen on top .
77882	0	a	Yeah .
77883	0	a	Yeah .
77884	0	a	Yeah they are used to it .
77885	0	a	Okay the
77886	0	a	yeah .
77887	0	a	So you you just have to reach a little bit for the power button .
77888	0	a	That is possible .
77889	0	a	I mean if you grab it .
77890	0	a	On once it is on it is on .
77891	0	a	But most most of the times if a if if a TV is on standby people just press a channel to put it on .
77892	0	a	You do not need the power button .
77893	0	a	Yeah , okay .
77894	1	a	Okay we put it on top .
77895	1	a	So we put this on top , and then make the corporate logo like over here .
77896	0	a	Yeah .
77897	1	a	RR .
77898	0	a	And j and the microphone , I mean it can be very small .
77899	0	a	If you look at your mobile phones are some stripes , little little holes .
77900	0	a	Yeah .
77901	1	a	Maybe on the top or even on the side .
77902	0	a	Yeah maybe on the side .
77903	0	a	I mean if the if the microphone is good .
77904	0	a	Yeah but then it is possible that you cover it with your hand
77905	0	a	so I think that top is the best option .
77906	0	a	True .
77907	0	a	Yeah okay .
77908	0	a	Yeah .
77909	0	a	So on the on the top is better .
77910	0	a	But if you if you hold the ma the remote like this , if you put it on the top on the side I dunno .
77911	0	a	Yeah okay .
77912	0	a	Should be able to work .
77913	0	a	Yeah .
77914	0	a	Depends on the sensitivity of the microphone , but I think that is okay .
77915	0	a	Never mind .
77916	1	a	Can we leave this up to you ?
77917	0	a	Yeah so we we needed to integrate the sound and and image options right ?
77918	0	a	Like bass
77919	1	a	so we need kind of an equaliser .
77920	0	a	Yeah it does not matter that much .
77921	0	a	So
77922	0	a	but the screen is on top ?
77923	0	a	Which functions did we have left ?
77924	0	a	I mean this is basically numbers , volume , channel up and down .
77925	0	a	Volume .
77926	0	a	Up .
77927	0	a	Channel up and down , and the control of the advanced options .
77928	0	a	Screen is over there .
77929	0	a	Yeah .
77930	0	a	Yeah .
77931	1	a	So maybe it , we should decide what advanced options we want to put in the LCD screen .
77932	0	a	If we
77933	0	a	Yeah it it is just a remote control
77934	0	a	so
77935	0	a	Yeah .
77936	0	a	Yeah .
77937	0	a	That is that is a good one .
77938	0	a	Yeah .
77939	0	a	Yeah
77940	0	a	so sounds ?
77941	0	a	Yeah
77942	0	a	and they are
77943	0	a	They are not used often so
77944	0	a	Yeah just
77945	0	a	Yeah sounds .
77946	0	a	Sound ?
77947	0	a	Yeah .
77948	0	a	If you
77949	0	a	Yeah treble , middl middle , bass or something .
77950	0	a	Equaliser .
77951	0	a	So if you have sound
77952	1	a	But not too advanced .
77953	0	a	I mean most TVs use only treble and bass .
77954	0	a	Yeah .
77955	0	a	It is pretty hard to write .
77956	0	a	as .
77957	0	a	Okay but you have sound ?
77958	0	a	Yeah just oh y you have digital
77959	1	a	better write it down over there
77960	1	a	yeah .
77961	0	a	Yeah .
77962	1	a	Of course .
77963	0	a	So you have sound .
77964	0	a	I am just a secretary .
77965	0	a	Yeah .
77966	0	a	Coffee ?
77967	0	a	Treble bass .
77968	1	a	yeah sound and then within sound I guess treble and bass ?
77969	0	a	Yeah .
77970	0	a	Yes please .
77971	1	a	the mono stereo option ?
77972	0	a	And there there was something else also .
77973	0	a	Pitch I believe ,
77974	0	a	yeah .
77975	0	a	Also .
77976	0	a	And then pitch .
77977	0	a	Pitch .
77978	0	a	Yeah .
77979	0	a	But pitch , is not that
77980	0	a	yeah that is the the height of the tone .
77981	0	a	Yeah .
77982	0	a	The fr
77983	0	a	yeah
77984	0	a	the frequency of the tones ,
77985	0	a	yeah .
77986	0	a	Yeah okay ,
77987	0	a	wh why would you use that ?
77988	0	a	If people like talk like
77989	0	a	Yeah .
77990	0	a	Yeah and mono stereo .
77991	0	a	Yeah is not that that depends on the on the signal of the of what program you are watching .
77992	1	a	And also the tuning part ?
77993	0	a	Yeah programming .
77994	0	a	Programming part .
77995	0	a	so we have sound ,
77996	0	a	yeah ?
77997	0	a	Channel programming .
77998	1	a	So channel programming ?
77999	0	a	And yeah in the functionality of the no no of the remote
78000	1	a	do do we want the buttons to make sound when you press them ?
78001	1	a	As a confirmation or whatever you know ?
78002	0	a	I dunno .
78003	0	a	Television itself
78004	0	a	I think it g it gets annoying .
78005	0	a	I mean most mobile phones used that in the beginning but
78006	0	a	Yeah .
78007	0	a	Yeah .
78008	1	a	We we could make an option for it , but you can disable s
78009	0	a	Yeah .
78010	0	a	Under the a yeah advanced option menu you can put those things .
78011	0	a	But the the television itself has also the the options brightness and screen colour etcetera .
78012	0	a	So
78013	0	a	yeah .
78014	0	a	Contrast
78015	0	a	yeah .
78016	0	a	Yeah but people do not want to sit on their knees on their knees in front of their television with only three buttons then it is very hard to
78017	0	a	y yeah contrast and brightness ?
78018	0	a	Yeah those are the most used I guess .
78019	0	a	No .
78020	0	a	, so contrast ,
78021	0	a	bright ,
78022	0	a	And the others were in your presentation right ?
78023	1	a	So I can just copy those ?
78024	0	a	Okay .
78025	0	a	Yeah .
78026	0	a	If you look at your monitor .
78027	0	a	Well yeah
78028	0	a	well I guess that these were the only ones , I guess .
78029	0	a	It is easy .
78030	0	a	Yeah .
78031	0	a	But so we have we have TV options , which is all this .
78032	1	a	I will look it up .
78033	0	a	Yeah the button options and the LCD options .
78034	0	a	The sound , sound and image .
78035	0	a	And you have in that the indeed the remote control options .
78036	0	a	Indeed .
78037	0	a	Yeah .
78038	1	a	So we need two menus kind of thing .
78039	0	a	Yeah
78040	0	a	you have basically a button menu , which you can use directly , according to the old principle .
78041	0	a	Uh huh .
78042	0	a	And the LCD options are activated by some some software options , thats communicates with the infrared decoder
78043	0	a	yeah .
78044	0	a	Yeah with the chip
78045	0	a	and then I mean
78046	0	a	yeah .
78047	0	a	So you
78048	0	a	You have an additional processor and and software part .
78049	0	a	Well yeah we have power button , whether that is present .
78050	0	a	Alright .
78051	0	a	Compared to o
78052	0	a	Channel volume selection present .
78053	0	a	numbers present .
78054	0	a	Yeah a audio settings , mono , stereo , pitch , bass , treble .
78055	0	a	L s
78056	0	a	Yeah .
78057	0	a	Screen settings , brightness and colour .
78058	0	a	Colour .
78059	0	a	Yeah I I call it contrast .
78060	0	a	Yeah con contrast is
78061	0	a	Yeah okay , colour and brightness .
78062	1	a	Yeah I make it c colour .
78063	0	a	Yeah .
78064	0	a	and what you say , channel settings or channel programming ?
78065	0	a	So you you have an option to to start scanning all the frequencies , and when it encounters one , well it shows on your TV .
78066	0	a	Yeah and automatically .
78067	0	a	And then you can
78068	0	a	and then you can select a number in your remote on which you want to save it .
78069	0	a	Yeah so I have g channel program is autoseek ?
78070	0	a	name a channel , or
78071	0	a	Oh they get automatic names , okay .
78072	0	a	Yeah , autoseek .
78073	0	a	Well most TVs automatically display the name , which they get through the cable .
78074	0	a	Yeah .
78075	0	a	So you only have to choose the position on your
78076	0	a	It only has to match the the channel frequency on your TV , with with the with the position on your TV and and so your remote .
78077	0	a	Yeah .
78078	0	a	Yeah
78079	0	a	but can you also say I want f Veronica on the channel number five or
78080	0	a	Yeah .
78081	0	a	Help .
78082	0	a	If you already programmed it .
78083	0	a	If you want to move it .
78084	0	a	Yeah .
78085	0	a	Yeah that should be possible too .
78086	0	a	How do you call that ?
78087	0	a	Channels ?
78088	0	a	Yeah .
78089	0	a	Yeah how do you call that ?
78090	0	a	Wait you you should be able to to browse through a list or something , which w displays all the all the values , all the channels which are possible .
78091	0	a	I mean like one to f thirty of or ninety or whatever .
78092	0	a	Ninety nine or something .
78093	0	a	Yeah .
78094	0	a	Just browse through it and then in some kind of way see if it if it if it is programmed .
78095	0	a	S swap channels ?
78096	0	a	Can I call it that ?
78097	0	a	Swap is good option .
78098	0	a	Yeah .
78099	0	a	Swap channels .
78100	0	a	Okay .
78101	1	a	other functions ?
78102	0	a	So you
78103	0	a	most of the time if you if you swap it S let is say for example you have RTL five on on channel five .
78104	0	a	And Veronica on channel eight
78105	0	a	and you want to move Veronica to channel five ,
78106	0	a	most of the times you override the previous the previous one .
78107	0	a	Okay .
78108	0	a	Well that is is up to Mister User Interface Designer .
78109	0	a	Yeah .
78110	0	a	It is it is pretty
78111	0	a	yeah
78112	0	a	I mean you have to look on on the menu on the TV .
78113	0	a	Okay .
78114	0	a	working design .
78115	0	a	Doch .
78116	0	a	Also .
78117	0	a	That is you are
78118	0	a	Yeah but also , which buttons you have to press to get a certain result ?
78119	0	a	And the working design was to specify how ph the physical interation between the components was , as I believe .
78120	0	a	He only has to figure out how it has to look .
78121	0	a	And how to use
78122	0	a	Yeah okay .
78123	0	a	Yeah .
78124	0	a	But
78125	0	a	You did your homework .
78126	0	a	Yeah .
78127	0	a	But yeah .
78128	0	a	Or or is it too hard to to ju to just do it all on your remote ?
78129	0	a	To programme the channels ?
78130	0	a	Okay .
78131	0	a	No no .
78132	0	a	No I do not think so .
78133	0	a	No that is
78134	0	a	Okay
78135	0	a	On the
78136	1	a	yeah can you i make a a map with with all the
78137	0	a	yeah
78138	0	a	cause it is now there are lots and lots of documents
78139	0	a	and
78140	0	a	The the layout of the remote control ?
78141	0	a	Is not that more the the u the user interface part ?
78142	0	a	Yeah .
78143	0	a	It should be able to do any remote .
78144	0	a	But I think the communication with the television is difficult .
78145	0	a	But that is not our part .
78146	0	a	Yeah .
78147	0	a	No .
78148	0	a	We do not have to design a protocol so
78149	0	a	No that is the
78150	0	a	Yeah .
78151	0	a	No .
78152	0	a	That is true .
78153	0	a	That is true .
78154	0	a	Thank god .
78155	0	a	Yeah .
78156	1	a	So we have a figure a figure out a way to to do that easily .
78157	0	a	I mean th the autoseek is is not a problem .
78158	0	a	I mean you you current channel and then then it just says , on which number do you want to save this , and you just press a number on your remote , and then say confirm , okay ,
78159	0	a	and then it is it is saved .
78160	0	a	It is easier ,
78161	0	a	it is it is it is harder to , if you have already programmed it , to to swap .
78162	1	a	So we have to think of something for that .
78163	0	a	So but
78164	1	a	The User Interface Designer can design a menu for all these function
78165	0	a	I put them on the
78166	0	a	Yeah k kind of structure into layers .
78167	1	a	Yeah .
78168	1	a	Yeah I can .
78169	1	a	I will just try to reorganise things .
78170	0	a	So
78171	1	a	And and the layout of of the thing itself .
78172	1	a	So you design the basic function menu for the LCD screen ?
78173	0	a	I think
78174	0	a	th I think the yeah the layout of the screen
78175	1	a	and I think you can concentrate more on the button placement and the placement of the screen itself on the
78176	0	a	No
78177	0	a	I
78178	0	a	d I think that is more in
78179	0	a	all the functional aspects of the remote I think are in my department .
78180	0	a	Maybe more on
78181	0	a	Okay .
78182	0	a	Yeah .
78183	0	a	I have to know what it has to do , so if you want to you know the changing the channels
78184	0	a	kind of s thing is , I have to integrate that in the design .
78185	0	a	Okay .
78186	0	a	So he is layout and you are function .
78187	0	a	Yeah .
78188	0	a	Form function okay .
78189	0	a	I think that is a that is a good separation .
78190	0	a	But do I have to to to
78191	0	a	yeah
78192	0	a	to make the the menu layout also ?
78193	0	a	Or Are you going to do that ?
78194	1	a	Yeah ?
78195	1	a	I
78196	1	a	I am going to make
78197	0	a	yeah
78198	0	a	o okay .
78199	0	a	Yeah .
78200	0	a	Yeah .
78201	0	a	Yeah I guess so .
78202	0	a	I think i that is your department yes ,
78203	0	a	because w he already knows what
78204	0	a	Yeah .
78205	0	a	Yeah .
78206	1	a	Yeah we have to kind of work together .
78207	0	a	Yeah .
78208	1	a	If if I make the the the yeah
78209	1	a	the menu like , I have to state which function has to be in the menu ,
78210	1	a	and then you have to decide , it is , in a in a way that b is user friendly .
78211	0	a	But we are not allowed .
78212	0	a	Yeah .
78213	0	a	Okay .
78214	0	a	Y you
78215	0	a	you are going to make a list of what functions are are going to to be on the the screen , the menu screen .
78216	0	a	Yeah .
78217	0	a	Yeah .
78218	0	a	And I am going to make a a nice menu with with pages
78219	0	a	and
78220	0	a	yeah .
78221	0	a	Yeah .
78222	0	a	Yeah .
78223	0	a	I think yeah .
78224	1	a	With with some l with some layers in it .
78225	0	a	So some menus .
78226	1	a	Yeah and also make clear which buttons to press to get certain result ,
78227	0	a	because that is always the difficulty .
78228	0	a	Yeah .
78229	0	a	Every device has its own Menu
78230	0	a	okay .
78231	0	a	Yeah .
78232	0	a	Yeah .
78233	0	a	Well I guess this this button
78234	0	a	, the the the okay ,
78235	0	a	menu
78236	0	a	okay .
78237	1	a	Or you can incorporate two difference different buttons .
78238	0	a	like for your mobile phone .
78239	0	a	so this is only for to get in the menu , or to exit it .
78240	0	a	And then one to confirm , and one to go one step back .
78241	0	a	Back .
78242	0	a	Yeah .
78243	0	a	So it is like the the save button on your your mobile phone , if you have a Nokia or like that .
78244	0	a	Or the or the no button .
78245	0	a	To go one step back you it is only two extra buttons , but
78246	0	a	if it if it is very clear that they are for the screen
78247	0	a	Yeah because this this is used for both .
78248	0	a	Yeah .
78249	0	a	W we
78250	1	a	I think we have to to group , to make two groups .
78251	1	a	the one group for the for the display , and one group for the basic functions ,
78252	0	a	and
78253	0	a	Yeah okay
78254	0	a	but we we have a m
78255	0	a	yeah
78256	0	a	but maybe that is that is not
78257	0	a	yeah if you are if you are z zapping with your yeah remote control , you can press the the menu button , and then you are suddenly into the the
78258	0	a	yeah
78259	0	a	the display .
78260	0	a	Yeah .
78261	0	a	Yeah but they are incorporated ?
78262	0	a	Up and down is
78263	0	a	Smart ?
78264	1	a	Put it on top .
78265	0	a	Into your screen .
78266	0	a	Okay .
78267	0	a	So you
78268	1	a	l should leave the menu button out of here .
78269	0	a	You want to separate
78270	0	a	Yeah .
78271	1	a	And and just put it under the screen , the screen
78272	0	a	Yeah .
78273	0	a	Yeah j just just group group the
78274	1	a	yeah we make these the advanced functions and these the basic functions .
78275	1	a	So we make a yeah a line between them .
78276	1	a	But we should place the screen on top , right ?
78277	0	a	Yeah .
78278	0	a	Well
78279	0	a	But that is J Jurgen is department .
78280	0	a	F
78281	0	a	oh yeah .
78282	0	a	Okay yeah we swap
78283	0	a	Okay .
78284	0	a	Yeah .
78285	0	a	Yeah .
78286	0	a	So we make it a
78287	0	a	Okay .
78288	1	a	You just you just find out and .
78289	1	a	You just make the layout .
78290	0	a	You
78291	0	a	do we do the extra two buttons or not ?
78292	0	a	Yeah .
78293	0	a	Yeah .
78294	0	a	I think you should .
78295	0	a	It is easier .
78296	0	a	If you put too many functions in one button it gets confusing .
78297	0	a	Yeah okay .
78298	0	a	Yeah .
78299	0	a	That is true .
78300	0	a	So we have a a menu button and a s
78301	0	a	Okay .
78302	0	a	And to , okay and back , also .
78303	0	a	Yeah .
78304	0	a	Okay and back button .
78305	0	a	Yeah , or confirm and back .
78306	0	a	And of course the four arrows .
78307	0	a	Whatever .
78308	0	a	Yeah .
78309	0	a	No .
78310	0	a	But those are still y doubly used .
78311	1	a	Should we save this picture , or or you know what it looks like ?
78312	0	a	Yeah .
78313	0	a	Both the LCD
78314	0	a	Yeah .
78315	0	a	Yeah I am I am not s clear about the the extra two buttons .
78316	0	a	We have a menu button and
78317	0	a	That is the the one with the
78318	0	a	yeah okay .
78319	0	a	That that just to to activate the screen .
78320	0	a	So And then with these buttons , woa , y you navigate .
78321	0	a	Menu button access the menu in the LCD screen .
78322	0	a	You can navigate .
78323	0	a	Okay .
78324	0	a	But you can also navigate the channels .
78325	0	a	And the volume .
78326	0	a	Okay
78327	0	a	so that that is not
78328	0	a	Yeah
78329	0	a	that Those are
78330	0	a	multifunctional .
78331	0	a	Those are both both
78332	0	a	yeah .
78333	1	a	Hey is it interesting for users if we put LED lights under the buttons ?
78334	1	a	So that if you press on the menu function that only the buttons that are used for the menu are ligh li light up .
78335	0	a	Yeah .
78336	0	a	L l litten up
78337	0	a	yeah .
78338	0	a	Yeah .
78339	0	a	That is very good idea .
78340	0	a	Oh five minutes .
78341	0	a	N
78342	0	a	Yeah and then it is also easier to integrate several functions in one button .
78343	0	a	Alright .
78344	0	a	Yeah that is a good idea because then it becomes clear which buttons are active now , which you can use .
78345	0	a	Light
78346	0	a	Yeah sure .
78347	0	a	Yeah .
78348	0	a	Okay .
78349	0	a	Yeah .
78350	1	a	Anything else ?
78351	0	a	I have
78352	0	a	Volume .
78353	0	a	So
78354	0	a	Those buttons are are lit up .
78355	0	a	I think not .
78356	1	a	But just one thing .
78357	0	a	Should we use those two ?
78358	0	a	Them ?
78359	0	a	Or only this to to scroll ?
78360	0	a	And then use the two functional buttons to confirm , to go into something ?
78361	0	a	Oh no we have to use this to adjust some some bars ?
78362	0	a	Yeah .
78363	0	a	Yeah .
78364	0	a	Yeah keep it optional cause maybe you can you know go left to right and up and down in a in one menu .
78365	1	a	And maybe we should use this also as an okay button , still .
78366	1	a	And then just only a back button .
78367	0	a	Well we have those buttons .
78368	0	a	No
78369	0	a	Yeah .
78370	0	a	The pr the problem with the okay button in the middle is ,
78371	0	a	sorry
78372	0	a	sorry , is if you are pressing up and down , you can easily press the okay once you , when you are not already at your choice .
78373	0	a	We use all four .
78374	1	a	Yeah okay go ahead .
78375	0	a	Yeah ?
78376	0	a	Yeah .
78377	1	a	So maybe make one one okay button and and one navigation button .
78378	1	a	And one back .
78379	0	a	Yeah that was already decided .
78380	1	a	Yeah the with with the the channel and the volume
78381	1	a	yeah
78382	1	a	m a multifunctional navigation button .
78383	0	a	Okay that is what we decided earlier on .
78384	0	a	Yeah okay .
78385	0	a	Yeah .
78386	0	a	Right okay .
78387	0	a	Yeah .
78388	0	a	So
78389	1	a	yeah I want to close down .
78390	1	a	You want to close down huh ?
78391	0	a	That is okay .
78392	0	a	Yeah .
78393	0	a	I have to , sorry .
78394	0	a	Yeah .
78395	0	a	it is not because I do not like you but
78396	0	a	yh we have lunch break , and then we can work for thirty minutes ,
78397	1	a	and I have to write very fast to make the minich min minutes .
78398	0	a	Already .
78399	0	a	Yeah .
78400	0	a	And then we will see I do not know .
78401	0	a	Alright .
78402	0	a	How m how long is the lunchbreak ?
78403	0	a	Okay .
78404	1	a	We have to ask .
78405	0	a	Nobody told me .
78406	0	a	But do we have to write to write down the our stuff now ?
78407	0	a	Or first lunchbreak ?
78408	0	a	Because I
78409	0	a	I have everything in my head now
78410	0	a	so Okay .
78411	0	a	No I th believe there is first lunch break .

78436	0	a	Aye
78437	0	a	Y you saved it ?
78438	0	a	Does it save automatically in the project folder ?
78439	0	a	Or
78440	0	a	Okay .
78441	0	a	Yeah .
78442	0	a	It is

78450	0	a	Okay .
78451	0	a	Yeah you can open it with the picture preview or stuff like that .
78452	0	a	And we have to make some maps with with the all the the data we gathered .
78453	1	a	I try to organise it by these three .
78454	0	a	Yeah
78455	0	a	yeah
78456	0	a	yeah .

78459	0	a	But you got some extra information
78460	0	a	Okay .
78461	0	a	I do not really mind .
78462	1	a	I just put the minutes here and we will see .
78463	0	a	Yeah that is in the functional design folder .
78464	0	a	Yeah .
78465	0	a	Yeah that is just basically what I just showed .
78466	0	a	But where do you did you get the newsflash ?

78498	0	a	I just put it in the in the shared folder so it should be
78499	0	a	yeah
78500	0	a	I think so .
78501	0	a	Yeah , conceptual design .
78502	0	a	What or whatever does it
78503	0	a	No no no ,
78504	1	a	can you go back one ?
78505	0	a	cause it has to be PowerPoint pre yeah components design , that is it .
78506	0	a	Because I see only my own presentation
78507	1	a	yeah .
78508	0	a	This ?
78509	1	a	I will just put it in there .
78510	0	a	So , he is coming .
78511	0	a	I did get a bit more done than the last time , cause I knew that I did not have time
78512	0	a	so I just copy and paste everything into the Sometimes I have these pop ups or these sounds and there is nothing there , and also with I do not know how to use PowerPoint
78513	0	a	, so it takes me forever to get something done with it .
78514	0	a	Or not .
78515	0	a	Okay .
78516	0	a	Oh okay .
78517	0	a	I ca not cut and paste it into the other folder but Move to meeting room .
78518	0	a	She .
78519	1	a	You can look at the final report ,
78520	0	a	cause I have to record everything we are deciding and such ,
78521	1	a	so I am trying to write it down between everything else .
78522	0	a	Yeah .
78523	0	a	Oh .
78524	0	a	Yeah me too , .
78525	0	a	I I have got the same problem as well .
78526	0	a	Yeah .
78527	0	a	Yeah .
78528	0	a	Yeah .
78529	0	a	Here we go again .
78530	0	a	Welcome .
78531	0	a	we have again three presentations and then we have to decide on what concepts the mobile phone has to f the remote control has to support .
78532	0	a	Thi
78533	1	a	So who wants go .
78534	1	a	Yes .
78535	1	a	Who wants to start ?
78536	0	a	Sound .
78537	0	a	Yes ?
78538	0	a	Yeah sure .
78539	1	a	Me first again or
78540	0	a	yeah .
78541	0	a	Oh .
78542	0	a	No .
78543	0	a	Does not matter .
78544	0	a	Yeah .
78545	0	a	No problem
78546	0	a	Yeah .
78547	0	a	Alright .
78548	0	a	Did you open it already or
78549	0	a	no .
78550	0	a	No .
78551	0	a	Yes .
78552	0	a	So welcome to the marketing presentation once again .
78553	0	a	this time about trendwatching .
78554	0	a	well there has been inv investigation again , in the in the remote control market .
78555	0	a	it shows a number of developments .
78556	1	a	I will address them in a moment .
78557	0	a	fashion watch watchers have detected the trends for young public , because that is our public .
78558	0	a	well
78559	0	a	fruit and vegetables will be will be the most important theme for clothing , shoes and furniture .
78560	0	a	And the feel of the material is expected to be spongey .
78561	1	a	So the developments I will address them
78562	0	a	oh yeah
78563	0	a	well this is the fruit and vegetables looks of fresh bright colours .
78564	0	a	So to give you an idea .
78565	0	a	well the developments ?
78566	0	a	development one .
78567	0	a	well
78568	0	a	most important aspect for remote control happens to be a fancy look and feel .
78569	0	a	Instead of the current functional look and feel .
78570	0	a	well fancy stands for an original look and feel of the case and the interface .
78571	0	a	And the second most important aspect is that a remote control should be technological innovative .
78572	0	a	well it stands for the use of technical features that do not exist in current remote controls .
78573	0	a	I think we pretty much covered that with our screen and and speech recognition , so I do not expect that to be a problem .
78574	0	a	Yeah yeah .
78575	0	a	And the third development is that the remote control should be easy to use .
78576	0	a	Well the first aspect was twice as important as the second aspect,w which was twice as important as the third aspect .
78577	0	a	So that kind of gets you this ratios .
78578	0	a	So fancy look and feel is the most important point of attention .
78579	0	a	so the fruits and vegetables in combination with the spongey material .
78580	0	a	well technolog technological innovation , we have covered that pretty much I guess .
78581	0	a	and easy to use , I do not think that will be problem .
78582	0	a	So my point of attention is especially this part .
78583	0	a	That this will be a crux .
78584	0	a	Yeah .
78585	0	a	So that was the marketing presentation .
78586	0	a	I had only one document left .
78587	1	a	And shall I go first ?
78588	0	a	So I
78589	0	a	Yeah ?
78590	0	a	Alright .
78591	0	a	No .
78592	0	a	I I do not
78593	0	a	mi I do not mind .
78594	0	a	That is
78595	0	a	Do you want to go first ?
78596	0	a	Okay .
78597	0	a	So kind of this So a k a small example .
78598	0	a	Yeah
78599	0	a	yeah sure .
78600	0	a	No .
78601	0	a	Yeah .
78602	0	a	Kind of this this look .
78603	0	a	nothing about the buttons but just sponge kind of thing , and and some fruit and colours
78604	0	a	I dunno .
78605	0	a	Yeah .
78606	0	a	Just made a quick design .
78607	0	a	Cool .
78608	0	a	It is better than than my drawing .
78609	0	a	Alright .
78610	0	a	Yeah you are just the user interface ?
78611	0	a	Yeah layout .
78612	0	a	Yeah okay
78613	0	a	but I have to design the
78614	0	a	Yeah .
78615	0	a	components .
78616	0	a	Oh no .
78617	0	a	Yeah okay .
78618	0	a	Yeah .
78619	0	a	It is okay .
78620	0	a	You probably opened it .
78621	0	a	Yeah true .
78622	0	a	Alright .
78623	0	a	F five .
78624	0	a	F five .
78625	0	a	So
78626	0	a	I am dealing with the components design .
78627	0	a	let is see .
78628	0	a	I used some design examples we had from similar products .
78629	0	a	And I used possibilities from our manufacturing department about current components which will have to be implemented in the design .
78630	0	a	That is why I had to , wanted to go first .
78631	0	a	Well they gave me an idea about what people want .
78632	0	a	We are f mainly focusing on this group , but I want to make the distinction clear .
78633	0	a	I could not drag the pictures into the the slides
78634	0	a	so s
78635	0	a	so I do not have examples of how it looks like .
78636	0	a	But it comes down to what you what you think we should do with the spongey and the fruity looking type .
78637	0	a	If you , the young dynamic people want soft primary colours , which looks like fruits you know , you can and shapes that are curved and not solid straight lines anymore .
78638	0	a	So this basically yeah goes on to what you were mentioning earlier .
78639	0	a	There is a lot of factors involved in choosing the components .
78640	0	a	There is a lot of options that we have to discuss .
78641	0	a	for example the energy source .
78642	0	a	we have four types .
78643	0	a	The basic battery .
78644	0	a	we have a hand dynamo , which we yeah
78645	0	a	we Dutch refer to it as the kneipgatt .
78646	0	a	Yeah .
78647	0	a	the kinetic provision of energy which means if you move the thing , if you shake it .
78648	0	a	Which will be fun for toddlers right , if they want to use the
78649	0	a	And of course solar cells .
78650	0	a	Yeah .
78651	0	a	But I dunno how we would use that into the design of the actual product .
78652	0	a	Wi an indoors .
78653	0	a	So my
78654	0	a	yeah also also in you know countries where there is n is not much light like in Scandinavia , they would not be y able to use it half of the year you know .
78655	0	a	Oh .
78656	0	a	Yeah okay .
78657	0	a	Calculator is can do it .
78658	0	a	Yeah .
78659	0	a	So that is not cool either .
78660	0	a	Yeah .
78661	0	a	So
78662	0	a	for the a case , there is the traditional uncurved flat hard case .
78663	0	a	Single curved , which means that it has curves in one dimension .
78664	0	a	Or the double curved .
78665	0	a	I was not able to finish my personal preferences sheet ,
78666	1	a	but well you know that we will have to go for the double curved cause it is daring and different from what we have now .
78667	0	a	Yeah .
78668	0	a	the case materials .
78669	0	a	Well we have all kinds of hard materials like the the hard plastic , the wood and the titanium .
78670	1	a	I would definitely go for rubber
78671	0	a	cause it fits most in what people want to see nowadays .
78672	0	a	Yeah .
78673	0	a	poo ,
78674	0	a	this is a lot of text .
78675	0	a	I was not able to organise this yet .
78676	0	a	We have yeah several interface designs .
78677	0	a	we can use a scroll buttons for the menus , but we already kind of decided to go for the f for the pushbuttons , for the the arrow buttons .
78678	0	a	Yeah .
78679	0	a	Pushbuttons .
78680	0	a	Yeah .
78681	0	a	So that is not really interesting .
78682	0	a	Yeah .
78683	0	a	Electronics ?
78684	0	a	Yeah ,
78685	1	a	maybe we want to decide on what electronics to use
78686	0	a	the advanced chip I think is easiest to implement for the production , cause they they can print it better .
78687	0	a	Yeah .
78688	0	a	I think this is about it .
78689	0	a	Yeah I was working on some per personal preferences .
78690	0	a	I first chose for the battery , cause
78691	0	a	yeah
78692	0	a	I am traditional and that is the most obvious , easiest choice to go to .
78693	1	a	But I really think that we should maybe think about the kinetic energy ,
78694	0	a	where you have to move the thing to be able to use it .
78695	0	a	Yeah .
78696	0	a	Yeah .
78697	0	a	Yeah .
78698	1	a	As an optional feature .
78699	0	a	Yeah .
78700	1	a	Or combine both with a with one
78701	0	a	Okay .
78702	0	a	I guess we can only choose one .
78703	0	a	I think you can only fit one source of energy on the
78704	0	a	Yeah
78705	0	a	I did not receive any info .
78706	0	a	Yeah
78707	0	a	maybe we
78708	0	a	I can imagine that the kinetic type energy source would be more expensive to make .
78709	0	a	But it is more longlasting , that the people do not have to ever buy batteries again .
78710	0	a	Yeah .
78711	0	a	And it is more fun .
78712	0	a	And it is also more fun
78713	0	a	yeah .
78714	0	a	I always chuck my remote control around , so
78715	0	a	Yeah y exactly .
78716	0	a	Yeah , just playing with it
78717	0	a	and especially when the material is rubber .
78718	0	a	Yeah .
78719	0	a	It can be done , I mean , you ca not harm it ,
78720	0	a	so it is a perfect combination I guess .
78721	0	a	S
78722	0	a	yeah
78723	0	a	it is safe .
78724	0	a	And throw it .
78725	0	a	You do not have to be scared about bouncing it off the g floor and breaking it or whatever .
78726	0	a	Yeah .
78727	0	a	Okay .
78728	0	a	So that is the end of it .
78729	0	a	Yeah .
78730	0	a	So
78731	0	a	So double curved is like this , this , this , or
78732	1	a	go ahead .
78733	1	a	Kay next .
78734	0	a	No it means curved in two dimensions .
78735	0	a	So w single curved ?
78736	0	a	let is say would be a b square box , but then with curves on one dimension .
78737	0	a	Yeah .
78738	0	a	And double curved would means that it would have curves curves in every direction .
78739	0	a	Also in in height ?
78740	0	a	Yeah okay .
78741	0	a	Okay .
78742	0	a	Like three D .
78743	0	a	Yeah .
78744	0	a	Can we
78745	0	a	Yeah .
78746	0	a	One one very important thing I was yeah thinking about is the speech option .
78747	0	a	Yeah .
78748	0	a	We were going to use that .
78749	0	a	Yeah .
78750	0	a	So Yeah
78751	0	a	yeah that is one thing which I am not sure of how to implement it into the remote control .
78752	0	a	Design ?
78753	0	a	I
78754	0	a	And rubber .
78755	0	a	Well the visual representation is not there with speech
78756	0	a	but you can
78757	0	a	Yeah .
78758	0	a	No okay
78759	0	a	but it has to be combined with with the menu for functions and
78760	0	a	So okay .
78761	0	a	Just yeah .
78762	0	a	I think you can just match the speech commands with the functions that are already present .
78763	0	a	Yeah .
78764	0	a	Okay .
78765	0	a	So I do not think you have to design anything else for that .
78766	0	a	Yeah with the programme .
78767	1	a	But do j do we do the speech just for the basic options , for the simple buttons ?
78768	0	a	For for everything ,
78769	0	a	also for the advanced options ?
78770	0	a	Okay .
78771	1	a	Both .
78772	0	a	Yeah .
78773	0	a	we have this very basic trendy design .
78774	0	a	Everybody says it so that is what is
78775	0	a	yeah
78776	0	a	Yeah
78777	0	a	in the in the last meeting we we were
78778	0	a	yeah
78779	0	a	putting the the simple and the advanced options separated .
78780	0	a	That is
78781	0	a	yeah obvious .
78782	0	a	yeah .
78783	0	a	Pressing the the menu option will disable all other options on your remote control .
78784	0	a	And only the the LCD panel will light up and then you can only change the yeah the options .
78785	0	a	And and the and the buttons that you need to control it , I guess .
78786	0	a	Yeah .
78787	0	a	Yeah .
78788	0	a	yeah
78789	0	a	design has to be very attractive but that is your your op your yeah .
78790	0	a	you have to delete this
78791	0	a	but this is the the the simple layout .
78792	0	a	Yeah .
78793	0	a	display on the upper side with the the menu button and maybe a some sort of cancel button or save button .
78794	0	a	That would be the back .
78795	0	a	I am
78796	0	a	The back .
78797	0	a	Yeah .
78798	0	a	Back and okay .
78799	0	a	Back and okay .
78800	0	a	Back and okay
78801	0	a	yeah .
78802	0	a	What ?
78803	0	a	A little bit I think but not not everything w
78804	0	a	Okay .
78805	0	a	You did read the minutes I wrote ?
78806	0	a	You did read the minutes I wrote ?
78807	0	a	Oh okay
78808	0	a	cause I pretty much summed up all the buttons there were .
78809	0	a	So
78810	0	a	I hate doing work for nothing .
78811	0	a	Oh I did not read that .
78812	0	a	But
78813	0	a	But this is the the basic design for the for the m
78814	0	a	yeah for the buttons .
78815	0	a	I wanted to to categorise everything .
78816	0	a	with a speech display
78817	0	a	yeah ,
78818	0	a	sound , everything you you noted in your minutes .
78819	0	a	every pushbutton has has its own LED light .
78820	0	a	So you can yeah change
78821	0	a	m make it more trendy for for younger people .
78822	0	a	And if there are older people they wanted more yeah more luxurous so that is an a also an option .
78823	0	a	that was it .
78824	0	a	That was it ?
78825	0	a	Okay .
78826	0	a	Yeah .
78827	0	a	again .
78828	0	a	Ugh .
78829	1	a	Okay so what we have to decide is what kind of components do we use ?
78830	0	a	energy source , chip type , case type .
78831	0	a	And user interface .
78832	0	a	But I did not see a clear distinction between these
78833	0	a	so I think what we have is okay .
78834	0	a	So we only , we already decided that kinetic would be the choice for energy .
78835	0	a	No .
78836	0	a	the case would be doubly curved .
78837	0	a	Rubber material .
78838	0	a	So
78839	0	a	Rubber material .
78840	0	a	Rubber material .
78841	0	a	And that is the only thing we have left .
78842	0	a	Yeah we need the the chip on print to be able to support the the screen and and f audio function .
78843	0	a	Oh okay .
78844	0	a	No it is easy .
78845	0	a	So that is
78846	0	a	is that is that the advanced chip ?
78847	0	a	Wow .
78848	0	a	Yeah .
78849	0	a	Advanced chip .
78850	0	a	Yeah .
78851	0	a	Otherwise you would have a simple chip , just for pressing buttons .
78852	0	a	Okay .
78853	0	a	Yeah .
78854	0	a	But we need more .
78855	0	a	Alright .
78856	0	a	Kinetic .
78857	0	a	I am just thinking , this is not my department , but
78858	0	a	I
78859	0	a	I am not sure what this is going to cost ,
78860	0	a	to be able to m
78861	0	a	So cause we need to sell it for twenty five Euro a piece .
78862	0	a	Too .
78863	0	a	Double curved .
78864	0	a	I did not get any info on this .
78865	0	a	So
78866	0	a	Yeah .
78867	0	a	That is going to be difficult huh ?
78868	0	a	Yeah .
78869	0	a	Yeah .
78870	0	a	The cost of making it should be twelve and a half ?
78871	0	a	Yeah , so it is cheap .
78872	0	a	I have total here .
78873	0	a	Yeah
78874	0	a	yeah
78875	0	a	yeah .
78876	0	a	Yeah I do not know .
78877	0	a	I did not get any information about that so
78878	0	a	Yeah .
78879	0	a	We are going to produce it in China so it is no problem .
78880	0	a	Child labour man , we love it .
78881	0	a	Who does not .
78882	0	a	let is see .
78883	0	a	Is there a new thing ?
78884	0	a	Yeah the interface ,
78885	0	a	maybe can
78886	0	a	Ooh .
78887	0	a	well the interface type supplements .
78888	0	a	it is it is quite difficult because we we have not got all the options
78889	0	a	yeah .
78890	0	a	No .
78891	0	a	do you have a picture of doubly curved case ?
78892	1	a	And could you put that in the group folder ?
78893	1	a	Of the project folder .
78894	1	a	let me see .
78895	0	a	Wait a sec .
78896	1	a	If you go to your homepage or something , you should get your own information .
78897	1	a	Yeah I am going there now .
78898	0	a	Inspiration .
78899	0	a	I got my fresh and fyoo fruity picture also over there , so
78900	0	a	No .
78901	0	a	Well yeah maybe it is Maybe it is easier
78902	0	a	Yeah .
78903	0	a	you did not draw it yourself .
78904	0	a	Too less time .
78905	0	a	Yeah , also the menu .
78906	0	a	Yeah that that w
78907	0	a	Yeah .
78908	0	a	Yeah .
78909	0	a	This is the the menu I was looking at .
78910	0	a	Yeah I was thinking of that also , with with a with a arrow .
78911	0	a	Yeah .
78912	0	a	Arrow .
78913	0	a	Arrow
78914	0	a	yeah .
78915	0	a	So that indicates that there is an menu under that menu .
78916	0	a	Yeah .
78917	0	a	Yeah perfect .
78918	0	a	So
78919	1	a	Oh yeah .
78920	0	a	Yeah .
78921	1	a	Maybe it is easier if you guys come over here .
78922	0	a	Is the target group .
78923	0	a	S
78924	0	a	yeah .
78925	0	a	S see this is the the the standard traditional type , where the form yeah serves the function , you know .
78926	1	a	Yeah sure .
78927	0	a	It is like really basic .
78928	0	a	But this m is more appealing to old people and we do not want that .
78929	0	a	Yeah .
78930	0	a	Yeah .
78931	0	a	This is what we are looking for .
78932	0	a	And th that means curved in both dire dire dimensions .
78933	0	a	Oh okay .
78934	0	a	Not only like this
78935	0	a	but it has to be
78936	0	a	exactly .
78937	0	a	I see .
78938	0	a	Yeah also like this .
78939	0	a	So you can hold it .
78940	0	a	It has to be kind of instead of the PlayStation , the module .
78941	0	a	It has to be like the the Game Cube , you know , where your thumbs would be laying in the instrument and it has to be nice to hold .
78942	0	a	Yeah .
78943	0	a	But it has also to
78944	0	a	it it has also to be luxurous for for yeah rich people .
78945	0	a	And
78946	0	a	It ha
78947	0	a	Yeah
78948	0	a	but that is that is the the problem
78949	0	a	yeah
78950	0	a	the dilemma actually , cause we want to appeal to the to the young public with fancy with flashy colours , and with a lot of shape .
78951	0	a	Th this looks a little bit like like for only for children .
78952	0	a	The children is story .
78953	0	a	Yeah I have got it .
78954	0	a	So
78955	0	a	Yeah .
78956	0	a	Distinction .
78957	0	a	Yeah .
78958	0	a	And
78959	0	a	Yeah , and the and the rubber , it it will look cheap always ,
78960	0	a	you know , with the
78961	0	a	There is mobile phones , in which you can change the colour also of the lights .
78962	0	a	The colour
78963	0	a	Yeah .
78964	1	a	Okay but the the colours , you you can make it make the colours with LEDs beneath the the buttons .
78965	1	a	If you press a button and you can disable the the colour LEDs for for people that do not like it .
78966	0	a	Yeah .
78967	1	a	Maybe we should consider this function .
78968	0	a	To customise it
78969	0	a	and so I mean kids can make it look more flashy with different kinds of colours and people who want something , you know ,
78970	0	a	different , or more design , they can go for one colour like for example this photo th camera .
78971	0	a	Yeah .
78972	0	a	Different .
78973	0	a	Camera .
78974	0	a	Yeah .
78975	0	a	Cool .
78976	0	a	S underwater
78977	0	a	yeah .
78978	0	a	Yeah submarine .
78979	0	a	Personally I think it is really ugly .
78980	0	a	Yeah .
78981	0	a	Just give me the thing that it is inside there maybe I am too old for this stuff .
78982	0	a	Well
78983	0	a	Yeah
78984	0	a	but this
78985	0	a	this the is for the .
78986	0	a	Yeah .
78987	0	a	Very cheap cheap look .
78988	0	a	Yeah .
78989	0	a	Yeah .
78990	0	a	Okay .
78991	0	a	So those I think are all my
78992	0	a	oh .
78993	0	a	yeah bright colours .
78994	0	a	Yeah .
78995	0	a	Also a kind of rubber
78996	0	a	Yeah .
78997	0	a	And this is , this is with the curved that I mean .
78998	0	a	That is singly curved .
78999	0	a	Yeah .
79000	0	a	Okay .
79001	0	a	Yeah ?
79002	0	a	A compromise between what ?
79003	0	a	This , this would be single curved ?
79004	0	a	Yeah .
79005	0	a	That should be nice .
79006	1	a	Well we could make a compromise between that .
79007	0	a	But I do not know if it is worth the effort .
79008	0	a	instead of doubly curved we take a single curved .
79009	0	a	So to appeal a little more to the all the public .
79010	0	a	So s
79011	0	a	Yeah there is only in in this dimension .
79012	0	a	Yeah .
79013	0	a	Like this .
79014	0	a	So curvy or not .
79015	0	a	Also .
79016	0	a	Yeah .
79017	1	a	Yeah so we keep it singly c single curved then ?
79018	0	a	Yeah .
79019	0	a	Exactly .
79020	0	a	Exactly .
79021	0	a	Yeah that would be an option .
79022	0	a	I do not know what you think .
79023	0	a	I think the
79024	0	a	I mean our aim is to make something different right ?
79025	0	a	To make something new .
79026	0	a	Yeah .
79027	0	a	I would go for the double curved .
79028	0	a	Okay .
79029	1	a	And I I am I am thinking you know a drawing palette , where you have the shape for your thumb .
79030	0	a	Yeah I would agree .
79031	0	a	So it kind of holds nicely , something like that .
79032	0	a	Yeah
79033	0	a	but if you if you make it more curved we we can make more and more options for buttons .
79034	0	a	Yeah .
79035	0	a	Well this is really your decision but
79036	0	a	Yeah .
79037	0	a	If you have it have it in your hand , you
79038	0	a	you
79039	0	a	you are not only
79040	0	a	yeah
79041	0	a	you do not need one dimension but you can use other dimensions for pressing the the buttons .
79042	0	a	As well .
79043	1	a	You can make a trigger button or something like that .
79044	0	a	Yeah .
79045	0	a	Something to shoot at your television
79046	0	a	Yeah .
79047	0	a	Yeah
79048	1	a	or that that is the confirmation button or something ,
79049	0	a	that you scroll with your thumb , with the arrows , and then confirm .
79050	0	a	That is
79051	0	a	yeah .
79052	0	a	That would be a nice way to use it but
79053	0	a	I mean , yeah , I am thinking big already ,
79054	1	a	and we need something that well that that you can able to use in one hand I think .
79055	1	a	Different .
79056	1	a	Stands out .
79057	0	a	Or
79058	0	a	Oh yeah a one hand solution .
79059	0	a	Yeah .
79060	1	a	So from top view it looks kind of like this .
79061	1	a	But from the side you you can have it also in a kind of shape .
79062	0	a	Maybe because the the screen is on top you can have
79063	1	a	Maybe you can c have this kind of shape .
79064	1	a	can turn it maybe .
79065	1	a	To switch from buttons to interface .
79066	1	a	If you turn it a little .
79067	1	a	A little upwards .
79068	1	a	So that the screen is more towards yourself , so you can easily see your screen .
79069	0	a	Oh yeah .
79070	0	a	Least you can easily see it .
79071	0	a	How about
79072	0	a	Well well you have it in your hand
79073	0	a	so it is a kind of an angle from your eyes to the screen .
79074	0	a	So then you have double double curved in some way .
79075	1	a	So this this is so the screen is positioned over here .
79076	0	a	Oh .
79077	0	a	Something like that .
79078	1	a	And the buttons are more ,
79079	0	a	well it is very thick now
79080	0	a	but
79081	0	a	That is that is
79082	0	a	Yeah ?
79083	0	a	That that you can press it
79084	0	a	and then it comes up ?
79085	0	a	Or
79086	0	a	But then the side view can be straight .
79087	0	a	Yeah I understand what you mean .
79088	1	a	How about we do a a pop up screen , like the laptop .
79089	0	a	If you can flip .
79090	0	a	So that the only the simple functions will be visible at first .
79091	0	a	And then if you want
79092	0	a	Yeah .
79093	0	a	Something like that .
79094	0	a	so you have a the the side view .
79095	0	a	If you have a pop up screen .
79096	0	a	But I dunno if that is too expensive .
79097	1	a	So and you want to be able to make this
79098	0	a	I mean maybe it is too much
79099	0	a	Oh the advanced buttons .
79100	0	a	Yeah .
79101	0	a	No like
79102	1	a	I would draw it like this .
79103	0	a	Let is say this is the side view .
79104	1	a	That you have a a screen that will come up here , and can go down that way .
79105	0	a	If you know what I mean .
79106	0	a	Okay .
79107	0	a	So that it would come up like that .
79108	0	a	Yeah .
79109	0	a	Okay so the buttons are on top here , and you flip it over that way .
79110	0	a	Yeah
79111	1	a	or preferably even keep the simple buttons here , and then under the screen even you could put more more advanced buttons .
79112	0	a	Yeah .
79113	0	a	Oh yeah .
79114	0	a	Yeah
79115	0	a	yeah
79116	0	a	yeah
79117	0	a	yeah .
79118	0	a	Right .
79119	0	a	Right .
79120	0	a	That is
79121	0	a	the the more advanced options were for the for the menu .
79122	0	a	Yeah that is good idea .
79123	0	a	Yeah .
79124	0	a	Yeah .
79125	0	a	Yeah .
79126	0	a	But you you want
79127	0	a	okay .
79128	0	a	F for the LCD menu right ?
79129	0	a	So w w
79130	0	a	Oh
79131	0	a	Activate and th
79132	0	a	the
79133	0	a	yeah .
79134	0	a	Yeah .
79135	0	a	You just want to hide them all ?
79136	0	a	The oh .
79137	0	a	Yeah .
79138	0	a	No not all because you need most of them , the arrow buttons .
79139	0	a	But you can hide the okay and the back button .
79140	0	a	Yeah
79141	0	a	yeah
79142	0	a	yeah .
79143	0	a	And the menu button also because when you flip it open
79144	1	a	and you can maybe even drop the menu button because maybe if you flip it open it will auto activate amauto automatically .
79145	0	a	Yeah .
79146	0	a	So okay b
79147	0	a	but you have t
79148	0	a	you need some button to flip this open .
79149	0	a	Why ?
79150	0	a	You could just make it mechanical .
79151	0	a	True .
79152	0	a	True .
79153	1	a	But you can make a , yeah , you can make a trigger here .
79154	1	a	You know a simple with a
79155	0	a	Yeah .
79156	0	a	Yeah .
79157	0	a	Yeah and it says menu and it flips open and then you have the buttons to control it , in combination with your True .
79158	0	a	That is but it is it is not
79159	0	a	it is not very very strong
79160	0	a	yeah
79161	0	a	if you drop it one time .
79162	0	a	Exactly .
79163	0	a	It c it can go open .
79164	0	a	Well yeah
79165	0	a	the the idea of it was , is that because you close it , you cover the LCD screen and it wo not be vulnerable to scratches or whatever .
79166	0	a	If you cover it with rubber .
79167	0	a	An adv an adv and it will be covered in some kind of thin rubber layer or something like that .
79168	0	a	Okay .
79169	0	a	And
79170	0	a	Exactly .
79171	0	a	Yeah .
79172	0	a	So it can bounce .
79173	0	a	Exactly .
79174	1	a	We just have to make sure that the closing mechanism wo not break .
79175	0	a	Yeah ,
79176	0	a	It is very no it is very strong .
79177	0	a	Th it is very solid
79178	0	a	yeah .
79179	0	a	Yeah okay so that that may work .
79180	0	a	Yeah .
79181	0	a	That actually will offer some extra protection for the
79182	0	a	Yeah .
79183	1	a	Okay but then we still have the the the thing of the the the shape .
79184	0	a	Yeah .
79185	0	a	Yeah I was thinking , if if you have your hand ,
79186	0	a	it this is your th
79187	0	a	Okay .
79188	0	a	What kind of
79189	0	a	Harder .
79190	0	a	Yeah the lower part does not work I guess ,
79191	1	a	so maybe you should try it over there .
79192	0	a	If this is your thumb , and this is your hand like that .
79193	0	a	With your wrist .
79194	1	a	That you , that it would be kind of shape like this , you know .
79195	0	a	So it is easier to hold in your hand , to y
79196	0	a	f
79197	0	a	yeah .
79198	0	a	But when you are left handed , that is that is a problem .
79199	0	a	Yeah .
79200	0	a	Yeah of course .
79201	1	a	Yeah then w then you would have to to make it like this .
79202	1	a	Maybe can design two versions .
79203	0	a	Yeah .
79204	0	a	But that is that is very expensive
79205	0	a	Yeah .
79206	0	a	Like like you drew here .
79207	0	a	Yeah .
79208	1	a	And maybe th then make this thicker also than the centre .
79209	0	a	Give it
79210	1	a	I would give it a female shape
79211	0	a	but yeah .
79212	1	a	And ergonomical shape .
79213	0	a	Anyway .
79214	1	a	Yeah .
79215	0	a	Yeah .
79216	0	a	The female shape
79217	0	a	yeah .
79218	0	a	With two
79219	0	a	Oh yeah .
79220	0	a	Yeah .
79221	0	a	Obviously .
79222	1	a	We we could make some some rubber some rubber
79223	1	a	yeah
79224	1	a	mouse , with which you can change
79225	0	a	and so if you
79226	0	a	Yeah .
79227	0	a	Make it more appealing to guys .
79228	0	a	I mean
79229	0	a	Yeah but we have hardware inside , which is so it has to have some sort of basic shape .
79230	0	a	Some k esk
79231	0	a	yeah .
79232	0	a	Yeah
79233	0	a	but but that is optional for later I guess .
79234	0	a	I mean , we have to make
79235	0	a	Yeah we we better so choose one
79236	0	a	Yeah
79237	0	a	so okay
79238	0	a	we should better choose one sh one shape .
79239	0	a	Okay .
79240	0	a	Yeah .
79241	0	a	Some
79242	0	a	yeah .
79243	0	a	Yeah yeah .
79244	0	a	And also the screen , you cannot mould it .
79245	0	a	You know kind of thing .
79246	0	a	No no no no .
79247	0	a	Okay .
79248	0	a	Yeah .
79249	0	a	But that is the kind of the idea , so it lays good in the hand , and then on on the side with with your thumb ,
79250	0	a	you you can you can use ,
79251	0	a	yeah ,
79252	1	a	you can use the button option
79253	0	a	Spongey .
79254	0	a	And then you can
79255	1	a	You can place the screen here , which can come .
79256	0	a	Yeah .
79257	0	a	So the keywords are primary co colours , spongey ?
79258	0	a	Yeah .
79259	0	a	And but then I w I would
79260	1	a	I would do the arrows here , kind of thing .
79261	0	a	Spongey can be reached by means of
79262	0	a	Yeah .
79263	0	a	Those buttons ?
79264	0	a	And the simple buttons here ,
79265	0	a	so that
79266	0	a	I y
79267	0	a	eah that is what I mean .
79268	0	a	Yeah .
79269	0	a	And and the and the control thngs in the middle ?
79270	0	a	The the the arrows ?
79271	0	a	Yeah
79272	0	a	and then numbers .
79273	0	a	No the arrow is over here .
79274	0	a	The arrows over here , and here the s simple
79275	1	a	or do we want to make its shape look like a banana or something ?
79276	0	a	I dunno .
79277	0	a	Yeah .
79278	0	a	Yeah .
79279	0	a	Buttons .
79280	0	a	Okay .
79281	0	a	Yeah .
79282	0	a	Alright .
79283	0	a	I think that it is a nice design .
79284	0	a	pretty nice design .
79285	0	a	Yeah .
79286	0	a	It is cool .
79287	0	a	Yeah it looks pretty fancy .
79288	0	a	Yeah .
79289	0	a	Yeah that is
79290	1	a	Orange or something .
79291	0	a	bananas wierd shape and other fruits also ,
79292	1	a	so it is better to have some sort of basic print and then a fruit print in some primary colours .
79293	0	a	Yeah .
79294	0	a	Yeah
79295	0	a	we could make We should use
79296	0	a	Yeah w we need very primary colours , like bright red , bright yellow .
79297	1	a	I do not know what what colours should the basic print be like ?
79298	1	a	Like some soft green or something ?
79299	0	a	Or and then
79300	0	a	Oh yeah
79301	0	a	yeah
79302	0	a	, dark blue
79303	1	a	and then and then very bright , a yellow banana , an orange , a green apple , stuff like that , with very bright tones
79304	1	a	I guess .
79305	1	a	Or blue ?
79306	1	a	Dark blue or
79307	0	a	Yeah .
79308	0	a	So you have something like
79309	0	a	Yeah .
79310	0	a	Yeah .
79311	0	a	Yeah but the primary colours w we can create with the with the LEDs on the on the remote control .
79312	0	a	Yeah .
79313	0	a	Yeah okay yeah .
79314	0	a	If you we
79315	0	a	yeah .
79316	0	a	If you make it just a yeah
79317	0	a	bl give it a blue colour
79318	0	a	, then it is just a neutral colour , also for the for the more yeah for the people .
79319	0	a	That does not really work .
79320	0	a	Huh cool .
79321	0	a	To draw , I guess .
79322	0	a	No it is .
79323	0	a	Oh .
79324	0	a	What is this ?
79325	0	a	Right .
79326	0	a	Yeah it is text .
79327	0	a	N no you have to exit .
79328	0	a	Hm .
79329	1	a	You could also make line with
79330	0	a	Yeah .
79331	0	a	So that is
79332	0	a	So that is blue .
79333	0	a	Yeah .
79334	0	a	Two hours further .
79335	0	a	thickness .
79336	0	a	Oh .
79337	1	a	Oh .
79338	1	a	Wh why not go for the twenty ?
79339	0	a	Yeah .
79340	0	a	Yeah .
79341	0	a	That is what I call painting .
79342	0	a	Y
79343	0	a	Yeah
79344	1	a	and then on top of that .
79345	0	a	So that is that is a dark blue basic colour I guess .
79346	0	a	Yeah .
79347	0	a	It is pretty nice .
79348	0	a	And then
79349	0	a	Oh
79350	0	a	Yeah with some some yellow banana
79351	0	a	Like .
79352	1	a	Some yellow .
79353	0	a	Banana colour .
79354	1	a	And how about some some flashing standby lights ?
79355	0	a	Like you have on the Samsung ,
79356	0	a	well I do not like to call brands phones ,
79357	0	a	the you know that
79358	0	a	cause I remember from one of our first meetings that people lose their remote controls often .
79359	0	a	Yeah ?
79360	0	a	How do you mean ?
79361	0	a	Some some
79362	1	a	Yeah an orange .
79363	1	a	So it not not only in in the colours of the LEDs , that we want something to keep it visible at all times ,
79364	0	a	or
79365	0	a	Yeah .
79366	0	a	Yeah if you if flashing colour so you ca not lose it , basically .
79367	0	a	Yeah .
79368	0	a	Exactly .
79369	0	a	Well I think it is a bit too much but
79370	0	a	Yeah .
79371	0	a	Maybe a
79372	0	a	Yeah .
79373	0	a	Yeah .
79374	0	a	Well alright well this is more like purple I guess ,
79375	1	a	but it is should be more real dark blue , so the contrast with the with the fruit objects is pretty high .
79376	0	a	Yeah .
79377	0	a	Yeah .
79378	0	a	So yeah .
79379	0	a	That would be a nice nice device I guess .
79380	1	a	And which which colour should should I give the the display ?
79381	0	a	Or
79382	0	a	Yeah .
79383	0	a	Who ?
79384	1	a	And then you can use yellow or semething .
79385	0	a	I mean , the the colour of the background of the display ?
79386	0	a	well I do not guess it s has to be a sixty sixty six five thousand colour ,
79387	0	a	so yeah too expensive .
79388	0	a	Yeah .
79389	0	a	Why not ?
79390	0	a	Aye .
79391	1	a	So just just a a blue blue backlight or something like that .
79392	0	a	Yeah .
79393	0	a	Yeah .
79394	0	a	Green is too old fashioned .
79395	0	a	But blue , blue is okay .
79396	0	a	As long as you loo use high contrast between the the background and the foreground colour .
79397	0	a	J White backlight , and dark .
79398	0	a	Yeah
79399	1	a	maybe a maybe a white a white backlight ?
79400	0	a	Dark letters , yeah .
79401	0	a	So that people with with
79402	0	a	And also for people who are a bit colourblind .
79403	0	a	Like this .
79404	0	a	Yeah .
79405	0	a	Whatever which is visible .
79406	0	a	Yeah .
79407	1	a	I know you sh you should test it under under a light conditions .
79408	0	a	I mean it is hard to tell I dunno .
79409	0	a	Yeah .
79410	0	a	Colourblind
79411	0	a	yeah .
79412	0	a	Yeah .
79413	0	a	True .
79414	0	a	No so that is mostly red and green I believe .
79415	1	a	Which which colour should the buttons be ?
79416	0	a	Why adjustable ?
79417	0	a	No
79418	0	a	But maybe I mean they have to they have to have some colour
79419	0	a	right ?
79420	0	a	And if the background is very dark blue
79421	0	a	Yeah ?
79422	0	a	So more like
79423	0	a	Does not work very well .
79424	0	a	That is adjustable .
79425	0	a	Woah .
79426	0	a	All all buttons ?
79427	0	a	Okay .
79428	0	a	Yeah ?
79429	0	a	Or not .
79430	0	a	That is how we are going to make it more trendy .
79431	0	a	Or is it too expensive ?
79432	0	a	It is difficult .
79433	0	a	Blue .
79434	1	a	Maybe green .
79435	1	a	But do not we want to make the background the the bright colo colours ?
79436	1	a	So th the total of the thing is very bright ?
79437	0	a	Like the pictures I showed you guys .
79438	0	a	Yeah
79439	0	a	you can
79440	0	a	flashy .
79441	0	a	Those things were all like like bright red , bright red , flashy .
79442	0	a	bzz .
79443	1	a	More like this colour .
79444	0	a	Yeah something like that , something that stands out more .
79445	1	a	And then then yellow and orange and red objects on it or something .
79446	0	a	Yeah .
79447	1	a	But then then again , which colour should the buttons be ?
79448	1	a	The the press buttons .
79449	1	a	Should they be white or black or
79450	0	a	Yeah but it is pretty fresh , on the other side .
79451	1	a	Red maybe .
79452	0	a	And it it looks quite cheap , that colour I think .
79453	1	a	Black .
79454	0	a	It is it is not
79455	0	a	Yeah .
79456	1	a	The green ?
79457	0	a	It is actually a pretty trendy colour at the moment .
79458	0	a	Why ?
79459	0	a	Yeah .
79460	0	a	I dunno .
79461	0	a	So
79462	0	a	Ooh .
79463	0	a	It is it is trendy okay .
79464	0	a	Yeah .
79465	0	a	But
79466	0	a	My couch is in that colour .
79467	0	a	Yeah .
79468	0	a	Well it works pretty well .
79469	0	a	Yeah .
79470	0	a	And then time was up .
79471	0	a	not yet .
79472	0	a	Do you get a pop up if we
79473	0	a	Alright .
79474	0	a	Yeah within five minutes
79475	0	a	yeah .
79476	0	a	That you have five minutes left or
79477	1	a	So something like this .
79478	0	a	Y left
79479	0	a	yeah
79480	0	a	left
79481	0	a	and then I have to kick you out .
79482	0	a	Yeah .
79483	0	a	That should be pretty nice colour .
79484	0	a	But maybe the buttons , all buttons in red is maybe a bad contrast for colourblind people .
79485	0	a	Yeah yeah .
79486	0	a	No
79487	0	a	that is actu
79488	0	a	Red and green are actually the b the easiest to discriminate .
79489	0	a	Because the of the green .
79490	0	a	But the but the buttons have their own LEDs or not ?
79491	0	a	Okay .
79492	0	a	Yeah .
79493	0	a	They have LEDs but they have a colour .
79494	0	a	Even for colourblind .
79495	0	a	Yeah ?
79496	0	a	Yeah .
79497	0	a	They will see one of each as grey .
79498	0	a	But if you use green on blue , those kind of colours will look the same .
79499	0	a	Okay .
79500	0	a	I think .
79501	0	a	So red buttons are okay ?
79502	0	a	How do you mean ?
79503	0	a	Yeah .
79504	0	a	I think so .
79505	0	a	Okay .
79506	1	a	That that is a default setting .
79507	1	a	You can make them red .
79508	1	a	The the red buttons .
79509	0	a	Yeah .
79510	0	a	But I think you need to keep in mind that the LEDs are just extra light .
79511	0	a	they they do not determine the colour that much , I think .
79512	0	a	Okay .
79513	0	a	Yeah
79514	1	a	I I was think about a red red LEDs and blue LEDs and
79515	0	a	Yeah .
79516	0	a	No that is that is too busy I guess .
79517	0	a	Cause you have to print on them
79518	0	a	you have a background
79519	0	a	Each number is transparent .
79520	0	a	Yeah .
79521	0	a	partly but you have to print on the number .
79522	0	a	Or the the sign .
79523	0	a	Okay .
79524	0	a	So you ca not change the colour so
79525	0	a	Yeah .
79526	1	a	You better bet better better keep the LED and the button itself in the same colour I guess .
79527	0	a	Okay .
79528	0	a	So just an extra bit of light and attention .
79529	0	a	Bit of light .
79530	0	a	You can
79531	1	a	what we should do I think is is make kind of a see through plastic button , with one coloured LED behind it .
79532	0	a	Bit of feedback .
79533	0	a	Yeah .
79534	0	a	Yeah .
79535	0	a	Yeah .
79536	0	a	Yeah .
79537	0	a	So that the whole button will shine as the colour the
79538	1	a	And if you think about easy to use buttons , we have to , well we have to make it the shape so that it is easy to hold f for both hands , but also that you can reach the buttons with your thumb , if you hold the machine .
79539	0	a	Yeah .
79540	0	a	Okay with
79541	0	a	Do not mean to discourage you
79542	0	a	but basically you two are going to work on the smartboard .
79543	0	a	Next thirty minutes to design something so
79544	0	a	And the
79545	0	a	You will do the evaluation .
79546	0	a	, right .
79547	0	a	Alright .
79548	0	a	Of the product ?
79549	0	a	Which we do not have yet .
79550	0	a	Yeah .
79551	0	a	Yeah about
79552	0	a	Yeah I do not know .
79553	0	a	So wh how should I do that ?
79554	0	a	Oh okay .
79555	0	a	You probably get a mail .
79556	1	a	Or you you or you send it to me .
79557	0	a	Or just
79558	0	a	because you are going to design it on this board right ?
79559	0	a	Yeah .
79560	0	a	Yeah .
79561	0	a	Once they are finished .
79562	0	a	Yeah .
79563	0	a	Yeah but maybe you can do the evaluation you do not have to evaluate yet
79564	0	a	but you can make a procedure which to follow .
79565	0	a	I do not know .
79566	0	a	I I probably get instruction on that , how to do that ,
79567	0	a	so I make another presentation I guess .
79568	0	a	Yeah .
79569	0	a	Yeah .
79570	0	a	I kn
79571	0	a	I know what is going to happen in in
79572	0	a	yeah
79573	0	a	so
79574	0	a	I have a basic idea .
79575	0	a	About .
79576	0	a	Yeah .
79577	0	a	You have the basic idea .
79578	0	a	And you two are going to do this .
79579	0	a	Yeah .
79580	0	a	So we are going to work here ?
79581	0	a	On this sketchboard ?
79582	0	a	Alright .
79583	0	a	Look and feel and
79584	0	a	Yeah .
79585	0	a	Yeah .
79586	0	a	Good luck .
79587	0	a	Thanks .
79588	0	a	Yeah .
79589	0	a	Alright so that is
79590	0	a	Yeah .
79591	0	a	So I
79592	1	a	make new page and be creative .
79593	0	a	Alright .
79594	0	a	But we have to do it at this moment , after th this meeting ?
79595	0	a	Okay .
79596	0	a	Yeah you have
79597	0	a	thirty minutes .
79598	0	a	Thirty minutes .
79599	0	a	Then we have to see something which we can show to the management .
79600	0	a	Yeah .
79601	0	a	Yeah .
79602	0	a	Alright .
79603	0	a	so this is basically the what what we are thinking about ?
79604	0	a	Yeah
79605	1	a	l let is just delete all these or
79606	0	a	Oh , next .
79607	0	a	Yeah .
79608	1	a	Shall we make a new
79609	1	a	Yeah , I just make a new one .
79610	0	a	I would
79611	0	a	yeah .
79612	0	a	Yeah .
79613	0	a	Yeah .
79614	0	a	Next .
79615	0	a	Yeah .
79616	0	a	Alright .
79617	1	a	Oh and save this board .
79618	0	a	Huh ?
79619	1	a	Yeah I will just I will just keep it there .
79620	1	a	Just save it .
79621	0	a	Yeah okay
79622	1	a	but just press save and
79623	0	a	It will be fine .
79624	1	a	Yeah .
79625	0	a	On the left .
79626	0	a	S
79627	0	a	so , yeah .
79628	0	a	sorry .
79629	0	a	You can also include clip art .
79630	0	a	Okay .
79631	0	a	Yeah .
79632	0	a	Current colour ?
79633	0	a	So
79634	1	a	Shall we make some outline sketches of the basic shape first ?
79635	0	a	Because I
79636	0	a	I
79637	1	a	Yeah cause I have to focus on the on the basic look and feel design .
79638	0	a	So if you will rather draw in paint or something
79639	0	a	then look .
79640	0	a	Okay .
79641	0	a	Yeah .
79642	1	a	And then after that we can make the user inter interface .
79643	0	a	This ?
79644	0	a	pretty accurate .
79645	0	a	Yeah .
79646	0	a	Yeah .
79647	0	a	So how it is going to look .
79648	1	a	And you have to think how we are going to put the screen in it and those kind of things .
79649	1	a	So if I am drawing and you think okay I am not going to be able to put a screen in there , you have to correct .
79650	0	a	Oh we skip this I guess .
79651	0	a	Sound button press .
79652	0	a	Yep .
79653	0	a	do you mind if I draw in black then ?
79654	0	a	For normal sketches .
79655	0	a	Yeah .
79656	1	a	You can also include it .
79657	0	a	It is not much work .
79658	0	a	Light only button user ca user interaction .
79659	0	a	Oh no it is it is okay .
79660	0	a	so we kind of want the girlish
79661	0	a	figure .
79662	0	a	Yeah .
79663	0	a	That is included .
79664	0	a	Yeah okay .
79665	0	a	Yeah .
79666	0	a	So the pl the plastic plastic buttons also help because of they are only lit during interaction .
79667	0	a	I am not so good at drawing .
79668	0	a	So Well it is a good thing that the buttons are not , well that they are plastic , because then you can light up the light on when when they are usable .
79669	0	a	Excuse me ?
79670	0	a	No .
79671	0	a	Yeah .
79672	0	a	Yeah .
79673	1	a	Maybe you should draw it very large like this .
79674	0	a	Yeah but this part is not functioning properly .
79675	0	a	Yeah .
79676	0	a	Sensitive .
79677	0	a	Oh right .
79678	0	a	How do we or insert text ?
79679	0	a	Oh that is a bit big .
79680	0	a	Erase ?
79681	0	a	Yeah .
79682	0	a	I dunno .
79683	0	a	Maybe just start typing .
79684	0	a	It is a bit large .
79685	0	a	Yeah .
79686	1	a	You also do the other sides .
79687	1	a	Not only on the front si the top side but also the the side view .
79688	0	a	Yeah .
79689	0	a	Ex exactly .
79690	1	a	L let is make first the the the all the views .
79691	1	a	I thought for the side view , that the w the basic section would be rather a bit thicker than the middle , where you are holding it with your
79692	0	a	cause your fingers have to fit underneath and
79693	0	a	Exactly but the but the upper side has to be a bit more like that I think .
79694	1	a	The the front view , side view and the back view .
79695	0	a	Jesus .
79696	0	a	What do I write down ?
79697	0	a	Why ca not I work here ?
79698	0	a	This is much easier .
79699	0	a	Much easier , yeah .
79700	0	a	Yeah .
79701	0	a	Yeah .
79702	0	a	The middle has to be very small
79703	0	a	so you can have it in your hand .
79704	0	a	I do not see a sign that the meeting is over yet but
79705	0	a	Yeah .
79706	0	a	No
79707	1	a	so I just work here a few minutes .
79708	0	a	Yeah the display , we yeah
79709	0	a	we can put a display .
79710	0	a	do not you think ?
79711	1	a	So the display we will put in here , the basic functions in here , where it is most reachable .
79712	0	a	Yeah .
79713	0	a	The
79714	0	a	The th
79715	0	a	Exactly .
79716	0	a	The the arrow functions .
79717	0	a	Yeah .
79718	0	a	Yeah .
79719	0	a	Oh .
79720	0	a	This is hard .
79721	0	a	What do
79722	0	a	do not have to draw it exactly do we ?
79723	0	a	Wait .
79724	0	a	No it is it is it is okay .
79725	1	a	Let me try it one more time .
79726	0	a	Maybe I have it is easier if I draw it in once .
79727	0	a	Okay , of course it will become way more ugly .
79728	1	a	You can make it m larger .
79729	0	a	Maybe it is easier to to draw
79730	0	a	Yeah
79731	0	a	that is that is the basic idea .
79732	0	a	Yeah .
79733	0	a	This will take forever .
79734	0	a	It is fun to work with this pen .
79735	0	a	so , larger .
79736	0	a	Oh .
79737	0	a	Wrong one .
79738	0	a	And
79739	0	a	yeah .
79740	0	a	Yeah .
79741	0	a	So side .
79742	0	a	Five minutes left before the meeting ends .
79743	0	a	Kay .
79744	1	a	other views ?
79745	0	a	Yeah .
79746	0	a	Alright .
79747	0	a	Yeah only if you are going to put buttons on the side of the unit .
79748	0	a	That is the question .
79749	0	a	But we we
79750	0	a	I is it if if this is from the side
79751	0	a	woah .
79752	1	a	Let is fill i fill in the buttons later .
79753	0	a	Yeah .
79754	0	a	So this is going to be from the
79755	0	a	from
79756	0	a	yeah yeah .
79757	0	a	From the Yeah I am I am
79758	0	a	May maybe it is it is easier to to integrate the the the LCD screen just into this this bubble .
79759	0	a	Steady .
79760	0	a	Sorry .
79761	0	a	Because there the screen goes up like that right ?
79762	0	a	So then it is like this ,
79763	0	a	or that is not convenient because then you have the screen like this and look like the it is better to have it somewhat like this .
79764	0	a	Yeah .
79765	0	a	Yeah ?
79766	1	a	The the idea is that it has to flip up to here .
79767	1	a	Or does it flip all the way ?
79768	0	a	It is better to to have this like this I guess , and then flip it like this .
79769	0	a	Okay .
79770	0	a	Because it do does not have to flip then .
79771	0	a	Because we have en enough space for for making a an LCD .
79772	0	a	Yeah .
79773	0	a	Yeah
79774	0	a	yeah
79775	0	a	yeah .
79776	0	a	Because here
79777	0	a	But why why do we need the flipping
79778	0	a	Okay .
79779	0	a	True .
79780	0	a	you can adjust the angle to which it flips .
79781	0	a	So it can also from this angle , it can flip all the way up to there .
79782	0	a	Yeah .
79783	0	a	You can flip it up to there if you want .
79784	0	a	Yeah .
79785	0	a	So w yeah .
79786	1	a	But we still keep the flipping mechanism .
79787	0	a	Think so .
79788	0	a	Yeah .
79789	0	a	Yeah we keep the flip ?
79790	0	a	Keep the flip live .
79791	0	a	Yeah because I think it will feel weird if you would make this smaller and this bigger or something that I dunno .
79792	0	a	Yeah .
79793	0	a	the the shape is okay but
79794	0	a	yeah ?
79795	0	a	I do not see the the
79796	0	a	yeah
79797	0	a	why why we should use the the flipping mechanism .
79798	0	a	Yeah .
79799	0	a	I thought it would be cool .
79800	0	a	Because we
79801	0	a	Okay yeah .
79802	0	a	It is it is for for for more trendy
79803	0	a	Because we have enough space .
79804	0	a	Yeah
79805	0	a	but maybe
79806	0	a	Yeah
79807	0	a	but maybe we
79808	0	a	we should then
79809	0	a	Yeah there the middle
79810	1	a	Sh sh should not we integrate it ?
79811	0	a	And then like i
79812	0	a	oh th
79813	0	a	doh .
79814	0	a	H here
79815	0	a	we got the basic functions , the the arrow
79816	0	a	yeah button .
79817	0	a	Yeah
79818	0	a	and then h we sh .
79819	0	a	Come on .
79820	0	a	So this is the shape .
79821	0	a	Oh .
79822	0	a	It has not
79823	1	a	Okay but the screen is a bit lower
79824	0	a	because if it falls on the other side , it does not fall on the screen .
79825	0	a	It does not aim so well .
79826	0	a	Yeah , then it is
79827	0	a	No flipping or
79828	0	a	you wanted the flipping so
79829	0	a	But if you if you
79830	0	a	If you drop it it it just breaks .
79831	1	a	So there is a layer of rubber on the side .
79832	0	a	Yeah
79833	0	a	yeah
79834	0	a	yeah .
79835	0	a	Definitely .
79836	1	a	So no flipping but just
79837	0	a	no .
79838	0	a	No flipping ?
79839	0	a	It is shaking .
79840	0	a	Yeah I guess
79841	0	a	but I mean most votes count right ?
79842	0	a	Yeah .
79843	0	a	And it has to be very strong because of the .
79844	0	a	Yeah kind of
79845	0	a	And it is also for the for the children , it is yeah for people not sixteen years .
79846	0	a	Throwing and the kinetics .
79847	1	a	Oh .
79848	1	a	We better make we better make it like this .
79849	0	a	Yeah true true .
79850	0	a	Yeah .
79851	1	a	Eventually .
79852	0	a	Yeah just light on top .
79853	0	a	Yeah if you if you are going for the kinetics
79854	0	a	Yeah .
79855	0	a	Yeah .
79856	0	a	Safer .
79857	0	a	they are responsible enough to have a mobile phone , so also to to deal with their remote control .
79858	0	a	But there are more
79859	0	a	Yeah okay .
79860	0	a	Yeah okay that
79861	0	a	the target group .
79862	0	a	That is true .
79863	0	a	Yes .
79864	0	a	Okay .
79865	0	a	Yeah ?
79866	0	a	Okay wi
79867	0	a	Yeah .
79868	0	a	Well .
79869	0	a	I am just thinking totally different designs also .
79870	0	a	I just ended the meeting .
79871	1	a	You two go design .
79872	0	a	Remember that the weird pocketphone thingy which looked like kind of a Gameboy .
79873	0	a	Oh .
79874	0	a	By the way .
79875	0	a	I thought up a name for our product .
79876	1	a	Maybe we should try something like that .
79877	1	a	But yeah .
79878	0	a	Yeah ?
79879	0	a	Ooh .
79880	0	a	Oh right .
79881	0	a	Yeah .
79882	0	a	It is called the Real Remote .
79883	0	a	Alright .
79884	0	a	With a copyright sign after Real .
79885	0	a	Yeah .
79886	0	a	The Real Remote .
79887	0	a	Alright .
79888	0	a	Yeah .
79889	0	a	I like it .
79890	0	a	Okay .
79891	1	a	So maybe you can include that somewhere .
79892	0	a	Good .
79893	0	a	This can go .
79894	0	a	Yeah .
79895	0	a	We should work in our own room right ?
79896	0	a	Or not ?
79897	0	a	Yeah .
79898	0	a	Yeah .
79899	1	a	Oh yeah we have to f include that in our design as well .
79900	0	a	I do not see any power cables here
79901	0	a	so
79902	0	a	Kay .
79903	0	a	Let is see .
79904	0	a	Yes .
79905	0	a	What the hell is that ?
79906	0	a	Yeah .
79907	0	a	I think it is the sensors .
79908	0	a	Okay .
79909	0	a	Yep .
79910	0	a	Okay that is the side .
79911	0	a	it is it is okay .
79912	0	a	But do we want options on the on the side with the with the buttons ?
79913	0	a	Or just leave it ?
79914	1	a	could make an a volume button scroll , volume button .
79915	0	a	I think we do .
79916	0	a	Yeah
79917	1	a	or j or also scrolling for the m
79918	1	a	yeah .
79919	0	a	For menu .
79920	0	a	Yeah ?
79921	0	a	I dunno .
79922	0	a	Or Yeah .
79923	0	a	We w kind of wanted to stick with the
79924	0	a	Yeah I am just thinking , if we i we want to make something different
79925	0	a	right ?
79926	0	a	So the with the scroll is is more futuristic than the standard arrow buttons .
79927	0	a	No
79928	0	a	, yeah .
79929	0	a	Yeah .
79930	0	a	 
79931	1	a	Okay .
79932	1	a	first of all I will start with the costs ,
79933	0	a	because that is going to influence our design .
79934	0	a	Oh no .
79935	0	a	Oh , .
79936	0	a	If you
79937	0	a	Do not know if you al already had a look or not ?
79938	0	a	Because we have a problem .
79939	0	a	Did you do your questionnaire already ?
79940	0	a	It wants
79941	0	a	Yeah but everything is .
79942	0	a	No
79943	0	a	n I I already did it .
79944	0	a	No .
79945	0	a	It is not much .
79946	0	a	It is just one question .
79947	0	a	Oh .
79948	0	a	If you look closely , you can see .
79949	0	a	Yeah .
79950	0	a	I already took the liberty to make some suggestions .
79951	0	a	At the moment we have fifteen buttons , one LCD screen , one advanced chip on print .
79952	0	a	We use a sensor , that is for the speech .
79953	0	a	we use kinetic energy .
79954	0	a	And we wanted the buttons in a special colour .
79955	1	a	Okay .
79956	1	a	What is the first thing we should drop ?
79957	1	a	The special colour of the buttons ?
79958	0	a	Okay .
79959	0	a	No that is that is for the trendy feel and look .
79960	0	a	So
79961	0	a	Yeah , b but
79962	0	a	I think the battery option .
79963	1	a	Should we switch to a hand dynamo ?
79964	0	a	that is the still the same idea as the kinetic energy because you have to use it and do things .
79965	0	a	No .
79966	0	a	Yeah but young people like that .
79967	1	a	So just do normal battery .
79968	1	a	Batteries ?
79969	0	a	Batteries .
79970	0	a	Just a normal battery then , yeah .
79971	0	a	Yeah .
79972	0	a	It has to be twelve and a half .
79973	0	a	Yeah .
79974	0	a	Or not ?
79975	0	a	, yeah .
79976	0	a	Oh .
79977	0	a	Oh my goodness .
79978	0	a	So
79979	1	a	You are going to redesign something .
79980	0	a	Oh no .
79981	0	a	Okay , so we are at twenty five .
79982	1	a	Do we keep the shape doubly curved or g do we go for single curved ?
79983	1	a	Well I guess i we will have to go for single curve then .
79984	1	a	I mean we have to drop on everything .
79985	1	a	But we can keep it single curved with top view still curved , but from the side it is it is flat ,
79986	0	a	and the screen screen is just
79987	0	a	Well you just have to hold it like this then .
79988	0	a	Yeah .
79989	0	a	Yeah .
79990	0	a	So
79991	0	a	Alright .
79992	0	a	How about
79993	0	a	Sorry .
79994	1	a	another option I saw was to drop the buttons one through nine , so you ca not directly access a channel , but instead use only the up and down arrows .
79995	0	a	That is what I was thinking .
79996	0	a	That would skip nine buttons and four and a half Euros .
79997	0	a	Yeah .
79998	0	a	Yeah ?
79999	0	a	then we have left
80000	0	a	yeah .
80001	1	a	Let is do it then .
80002	0	a	A a
80003	0	a	And cause then they do not have to
80004	0	a	n They do not need special colour as well .
80005	1	a	Yeah .
80006	0	a	we
80007	0	a	F eight .
80008	0	a	But we do not have any basic options any more .
80009	0	a	We do .
80010	0	a	They do not need special colours .
80011	0	a	Fine .
80012	0	a	That is more like it .
80013	0	a	Yeah .
80014	1	a	You were saying something .
80015	0	a	That was exactly my point .
80016	0	a	Like let is drop all the buttons , and just make one
80017	0	a	I mean we are going to use the LCD screen anyway .
80018	0	a	Yeah .
80019	0	a	So we will just have to use it for everything .
80020	0	a	Yeah .
80021	0	a	And then you can make an overview of channels in the screen , and select a channel , click
80022	0	a	Yeah
80023	1	a	we need one integrated button for everything then .
80024	0	a	Yeah , some more menu options .
80025	0	a	Yeah .
80026	1	a	Okay so maybe we can drop few more buttons .
80027	0	a	But
80028	0	a	Now let is look .
80029	0	a	Yeah we c could We only need the the the the the menu arrow arrow button thing .
80030	0	a	Everything you can do with with the menu .
80031	0	a	So With the display .
80032	0	a	Yeah .
80033	1	a	The joystick .
80034	0	a	Yeah .
80035	0	a	Kind of .
80036	0	a	I was Because
80037	0	a	Yeah .
80038	0	a	Yeah , scroll wheel , push button
80039	0	a	Yeah .
80040	0	a	Integrated scroll wheel push button , yeah .
80041	0	a	If you if you go to
80042	0	a	If you go to our view , like you if you are in the sound system there , and you want to adjust the treble for instance , this is just an example ,
80043	0	a	y y
80044	0	a	you want to see a bar on which you can adjust it from zero to ten for example .
80045	0	a	Yeah .
80046	0	a	But you want a sound preview of how it is going to sound ,
80047	0	a	right ?
80048	0	a	So you want to click on it , activate it , whe and when you move it , hear the difference of the treble coming out or going into the sound .
80049	0	a	Yeah .
80050	0	a	Yeah .
80051	1	a	So you will you will need a a kind of a joystick button .
80052	0	a	Yeah
80053	1	a	or or the integrated scroll wheel push button .
80054	0	a	Yeah .
80055	0	a	So that is kind of on your mouse
80056	0	a	and then you can click it , adjust it , click again and then you are out of it .
80057	0	a	But you still
80058	0	a	But you then still need to have
80059	0	a	Well you can use the scroll wheel as well for maybe for the channels .
80060	0	a	Exactly .
80061	0	a	But you still
80062	1	a	You still have to have some some button in the menu to go back .
80063	0	a	Yeah it is r
80064	0	a	Yeah .
80065	0	a	So you do one inte
80066	1	a	You can do one integrated scroll wheel push button .
80067	0	a	Yeah .
80068	1	a	And then just drop all the other buttons .
80069	0	a	yeah .
80070	0	a	Well not all .
80071	0	a	Not s not sound I guess .
80072	0	a	But but th the cost of one integrated button is far more than a few extra push buttons .
80073	0	a	No .
80074	0	a	Yeah .
80075	0	a	It is
80076	0	a	One integrated button is five times the cost of a normal button .
80077	0	a	Yeah .
80078	0	a	So we have to to make it s more
80079	0	a	It has to be
80080	1	a	Could drop the speech recognition .
80081	0	a	So
80082	1	a	You could also drop j three more of these , without losing much functionality .
80083	0	a	Yeah .
80084	1	a	You just drop the Okay and the Back .
80085	0	a	Wh wh
80086	0	a	what what what is
80087	0	a	the
80088	0	a	what is the sample sensor sample speaker ?
80089	0	a	Speech recognition .
80090	0	a	Oh , that is for the speech .
80091	0	a	Yeah .
80092	0	a	Right .
80093	0	a	S s Drop speech recognition ?
80094	0	a	Yeah that is possible .
80095	0	a	No
80096	0	a	but
80097	0	a	Yeah it is it is expensive , but we never considered the possibilities of speech recognition .
80098	0	a	We we d
80099	0	a	Yeah .
80100	0	a	Cause it can take the function of a lot of buttons .
80101	0	a	Buttons .
80102	0	a	Buttons .
80103	0	a	That is not very easy to use .
80104	0	a	I
80105	0	a	No .
80106	0	a	No , it can be disturbed by by noise and
80107	0	a	stuff like that .
80108	0	a	Yeah but lets just say that the speech recognition works .
80109	1	a	Let let let me see what is more what is more popular .
80110	0	a	I guess the the screen was more popular than than the speech recognition .
80111	0	a	Yeah .
80112	1	a	I have to look on that .
80113	1	a	Let me see .
80114	0	a	well no I was wrong .
80115	0	a	There are more people who like speech recognition than an LCD screen .
80116	0	a	Yep .
80117	0	a	Okay .
80118	0	a	Because if you d lose the LCD screen , we need a lot of Yeah .
80119	0	a	But if it But it it it is a it is a both a hypers
80120	0	a	No , but
80121	0	a	Well we
80122	0	a	Yeah we keep the screen .
80123	0	a	We lose our whole concept .
80124	0	a	so No we just
80125	1	a	We keep the LCD .
80126	0	a	We need a lot of extra buttons .
80127	0	a	I mean it is it is about the same .
80128	0	a	Eight one to ninety one percent , sixty six to seventy six .
80129	0	a	We we we have not really integrated this the speech into the system ,
80130	1	a	so we can might as well s drop that .
80131	0	a	Okay
80132	1	a	so we drop the speech .
80133	0	a	And drop it yeah ?
80134	0	a	Okay .
80135	0	a	Yeah .
80136	0	a	Yeah .
80137	0	a	Let is drop the speech .
80138	0	a	S Fo
80139	0	a	Four less Euros .
80140	0	a	Sixteen Euros .
80141	0	a	So we still have three and a half Euro to lose .
80142	1	a	We need to lose some buttons .
80143	0	a	But y y
80144	0	a	Yeah .
80145	0	a	Yeah
80146	1	a	if you lose the the Back , the Okay button v let is say we only have the four arrows , and the Menu button .
80147	0	a	Yeah .
80148	0	a	Then you are
80149	0	a	Oh and the power button we have also .
80150	0	a	And then and then use The the
80151	0	a	Okay .
80152	1	a	And the menu button does also does the okay function then .
80153	0	a	Yeah .
80154	0	a	And then when you in the menu S
80155	0	a	so so you activate the menu .
80156	0	a	So that is one Euro .
80157	1	a	If we do two integrated scroll wheel push buttons , we can drop all the the push buttons .
80158	0	a	Yeah .
80159	0	a	Yeah ?
80160	0	a	And
80161	0	a	That would save zero point two Euros compared to
80162	0	a	No .
80163	1	a	With with one integrated button we can do the whole menu thing .
80164	0	a	Yeah yeah .
80165	1	a	With the other , we can do the the channel , the volume , et cetera .
80166	0	a	Yeah .
80167	0	a	No it is three Euros .
80168	0	a	No ?
80169	0	a	No it is it is
80170	0	a	n
80171	0	a	Yeah .
80172	0	a	Yeah .
80173	0	a	To This together is more expensive than Oof , it is almost the same as t keeping this .
80174	0	a	Yeah
80175	0	a	yeah
80176	0	a	yeah .
80177	0	a	Well okay .
80178	1	a	And we can drop these two .
80179	0	a	For example if you have f f four buttons , channel up and down , volume left right
80180	1	a	Okay , I have I think we have to keep that .
80181	0	a	It is the
80182	0	a	Let is make the
80183	1	a	Let is make the case plastic .
80184	0	a	Volume .
80185	0	a	And the power button .
80186	0	a	And then
80187	0	a	and the power button .
80188	0	a	So that is five .
80189	0	a	That is the basic .
80190	0	a	That is basic .
80191	0	a	That that is what you need anyway .
80192	1	a	And then for the menu , you can have a button that activates menu .
80193	1	a	Or d or do we just integrate an an an scroll wheel with a push button .
80194	0	a	And then if the moment you use the scroll wheel , the the the menu gets activated , and then you can scroll , choose an option , click on it , it goes into an feature .
80195	0	a	Click on it again , selects features , scroll , adjust it .
80196	0	a	Click again , it is okay .
80197	0	a	Then you only need one button to move back .
80198	0	a	Or or under each option , you set a you set an a screen thing what says back , and you select that one , click again , and you go one step back .
80199	0	a	And in that menu , scroll , click , one step back .
80200	0	a	So that then you need five buttons , and one integrated scroll wheel push button .
80201	0	a	Yep .
80202	0	a	Which That is even
80203	1	a	Yeah , if you if you go to eight
80204	0	a	I do not know how to
80205	0	a	Yeah ,
80206	0	a	we need the chip for the for the LC display .
80207	0	a	But we ca not drop three buttons .
80208	0	a	Okay th that is
80209	0	a	Yeah that is one Euro more expensive .
80210	0	a	But I see that is
80211	0	a	Yeah .
80212	0	a	So that is not a good idea .
80213	0	a	That is not an option .
80214	0	a	Because which buttons do we have now ?
80215	0	a	Those five which I mentioned , and then menu , and then
80216	0	a	Yeah .
80217	0	a	Menu , power .
80218	0	a	F of the four things ?
80219	0	a	Yeah ,
80220	0	a	th power .
80221	0	a	Four arrows ?
80222	0	a	Power .
80223	0	a	Yeah .
80224	0	a	Which more ?
80225	0	a	Yeah .
80226	0	a	Okay .
80227	0	a	So four arrows ?
80228	0	a	power I believe ?
80229	0	a	We have a Back and a Okay button .
80230	0	a	Power .
80231	0	a	Th Yeah that is five .
80232	0	a	Yeah , okay that is seven ,
80233	0	a	and one to activate the menu ,
80234	0	a	yeah .
80235	0	a	And the Menu .
80236	0	a	So okay that is eight .
80237	0	a	Well we ca not reduce that .
80238	0	a	We we keep the display .
80239	0	a	Oh , well okay .
80240	0	a	Yeah , and even if we drop three buttons from here , we still have to make some adjustments around here .
80241	0	a	So
80242	0	a	The LCD ?
80243	0	a	Yeah .
80244	0	a	Yeah .
80245	0	a	Yeah well we need the advanced
80246	0	a	Instead of r
80247	0	a	Yeah but but that is not our market .
80248	0	a	Then I rather make it wood .
80249	0	a	Because then also it is good in the market with the forty five plus people .
80250	0	a	Yeah .
80251	0	a	Yeah .
80252	0	a	True .
80253	0	a	But
80254	1	a	Plastic with a with a special colour .
80255	0	a	No that maybe not .
80256	0	a	But maybe it is better than plastic anyway .
80257	0	a	no , hard plastic .
80258	0	a	Oh .
80259	1	a	A woo wood wood wood colour .
80260	0	a	Yeah , plastic with special colour .
80261	0	a	Yeah ?
80262	0	a	Yeah okay Yep .
80263	0	a	That is an option .
80264	0	a	No
80265	0	a	but I
80266	0	a	I
80267	0	a	Because we have to use the special colour anyway .
80268	0	a	You forgot that .
80269	0	a	Yeah .
80270	0	a	Yeah ,
80271	0	a	yeah .
80272	1	a	So let is go for the plastic .
80273	0	a	So we do one one s
80274	0	a	Yeah .
80275	0	a	Yeah , okay .
80276	0	a	Plastic .
80277	0	a	And since it is not kinetic , it does not have to flip around that much ?
80278	0	a	We still have problem of two Euros .
80279	0	a	that is easy because plastic is free .
80280	0	a	Yeah , okay .
80281	0	a	if we dropped
80282	0	a	Yeah ?
80283	0	a	You still need that .
80284	0	a	No the buttons , those are really needed .
80285	0	a	Yeah we ca not drop them .
80286	0	a	Yeah th th
80287	0	a	it is it is
80288	0	a	An advanced chip on print .
80289	0	a	Yeah
80290	0	a	You
80291	0	a	Yeah .
80292	0	a	Do we really need that advanced chip for an LCD display ?
80293	0	a	Oh .
80294	0	a	So the other option would be to go for the the sample speaker , and Which can use a regular chip , wh which is six Euros in total .
80295	0	a	S
80296	0	a	No , I keep the re
80297	0	a	Yeah .
80298	0	a	That does not matter .
80299	0	a	I rather keep I rather keep the display .
80300	0	a	Well yeah .
80301	0	a	Yeah .
80302	0	a	Because we already designed for it .
80303	0	a	So the only option is an hand dynamo .
80304	0	a	So Yeah and something else .
80305	0	a	Exactly .
80306	0	a	Oh that
80307	0	a	But the
80308	0	a	But the integrated button ?
80309	0	a	How many func functions can it have ?
80310	0	a	Okay .
80311	0	a	Oh no tha
80312	0	a	Oh that is one Euro , right .
80313	0	a	Yeah but the
80314	0	a	ca not we f fit all the buttons in an intreg integrated scroll push button
80315	0	a	Cause that will save us one and a half Euro already .
80316	0	a	And then if w
80317	0	a	Th then we have to scroll through a lot of menus to be able to get where you want , huh ?
80318	0	a	And
80319	0	a	Yeah d at l
80320	0	a	Yeah .
80321	0	a	And then integrated s
80322	0	a	Yeah
80323	0	a	but that would make it not so easy to use .
80324	0	a	No y you would rec Then you have
80325	0	a	Then you still need two additional buttons I believe .
80326	0	a	I mean it is not that important , easy to use ,
80327	0	a	but Yeah .
80328	0	a	For the volume .
80329	0	a	You can use those Yeah .
80330	0	a	At least one for power .
80331	0	a	Oh yeah and power .
80332	0	a	That is three buttons and this would cost
80333	0	a	Yeah .
80334	0	a	Oh .
80335	0	a	Yeah it is just as expensive as what we have now .
80336	0	a	Three .
80337	0	a	Up , down
80338	0	a	, Okay .
80339	0	a	Yeah endlessly .
80340	0	a	I mean it can be a power button as soon as it powered on .
80341	0	a	You can go into you in you main menu , you can choose flip channel , you can choose sound options , any options .
80342	0	a	You you press it for like three seconds .
80343	0	a	Then then then you should do everything in the menu .
80344	0	a	Yeah .
80345	0	a	On the screen .
80346	0	a	Yeah , okay .
80347	0	a	It would save enough
80348	0	a	Yeah
80349	0	a	you can choose this , drop these , then we have a half Euro left .
80350	0	a	Maybe we should .
80351	0	a	Cause we do not have money and w we want the screen .
80352	0	a	Yeah .
80353	1	a	So we can maybe still use power button .
80354	0	a	Yeah , but we would Alright .
80355	0	a	Yeah .
80356	0	a	I guess we have to .
80357	0	a	It s it saves us four Euros
80358	0	a	and it costs us two and a half .
80359	0	a	So let is see ,
80360	0	a	we we drop the price by one and a half .
80361	0	a	We will we will be on
80362	0	a	Yeah it says right here .
80363	0	a	Yeah .
80364	0	a	You see ?
80365	0	a	Oh still Yeah ?
80366	0	a	Oh then I miscalculated .
80367	0	a	But we still have thirteen left .
80368	0	a	Oh yeah .
80369	0	a	Thirteen .
80370	0	a	So still half .
80371	0	a	Shit .
80372	0	a	There goes the special co
80373	0	a	Well That would make it less appealing .
80374	1	a	Drop the special colour .
80375	0	a	Oh no .
80376	0	a	So that is no option .
80377	0	a	Kay .
80378	1	a	What else ?
80379	1	a	Uncurved ?
80380	0	a	Yeah .
80381	0	a	No no , it has to be curved .
80382	0	a	We sure about the advanced chip we need for the display ?
80383	0	a	Well yeah .
80384	0	a	Okay .
80385	0	a	They made it very easy for us .
80386	0	a	yeah .
80387	0	a	We made it hard for ourselves with the display , but it is a cool feature .
80388	0	a	, I do not think I can s persuade the management to say , this is better for the market so you sell more than
80389	0	a	Buttons .
80390	0	a	Okay .
80391	1	a	Wh what we could do is drop the the special colour , and do the special colour for the buttons .
80392	0	a	Yeah .
80393	0	a	That is
80394	0	a	Oh yeah
80395	0	a	since we only have one button .
80396	0	a	Yeah .
80397	0	a	Yeah
80398	0	a	but I mean what is meant by special colour ?
80399	0	a	S
80400	0	a	yeah .
80401	0	a	I just m
80402	0	a	I do not
80403	0	a	I think
80404	0	a	yeah it is I think it is grey , regular .
80405	0	a	Just something else than than black or white I think .
80406	0	a	Alright .
80407	0	a	Grey and rubber .
80408	0	a	But we definitely want the thing to be a special colour though .
80409	0	a	Of plastic .
80410	0	a	Yeah .
80411	0	a	Yeah .
80412	0	a	So I rather have an hand dynamo than than drop the colour .
80413	0	a	Damn .
80414	0	a	Yeah
80415	0	a	and then
80416	0	a	Yeah
80417	0	a	yeah
80418	0	a	yeah
80419	0	a	yeah .
80420	0	a	Yeah .
80421	0	a	You can still play with it then I guess .
80422	0	a	I do not know .
80423	0	a	Yeah .
80424	0	a	Yeah , but a hand dynamo costs a lot of energy to keep the screen working .
80425	0	a	So I guess that is not an option .
80426	0	a	The display
80427	0	a	The
80428	0	a	But if you have to power the for ten minutes , then the
80429	0	a	Yeah .
80430	0	a	Well , you only have to power it up when you want to use it .
80431	0	a	Yeah .
80432	0	a	Yeah .
80433	0	a	I do not know .
80434	0	a	No I do not think the current status of chips are pretty energy conserving , no .
80435	0	a	Yeah .
80436	0	a	Yeah true .
80437	0	a	Yeah .
80438	1	a	Let is let is go for the hand dynamo then .
80439	0	a	Yeah hand dynamo ?
80440	0	a	Do you want an extra button ?
80441	0	a	Yep ?
80442	0	a	Instead of an additional power button ?
80443	0	a	Yeah ?
80444	0	a	It is for scroll
80445	0	a	Without
80446	0	a	Yeah but it is just a scroll wheel which you can push down .
80447	0	a	Or or do we
80448	1	a	Or do we do uncurved and flat ?
80449	1	a	Instead of
80450	0	a	Yeah it has to be curved and has to have that colour .
80451	0	a	No no it has to be curved .
80452	0	a	Yeah .
80453	0	a	Yeah .
80454	1	a	Just put a special special colour of the buttons , or something .
80455	0	a	Yeah .
80456	0	a	And a screen .
80457	0	a	Yeah .
80458	0	a	That is the most import
80459	0	a	We only have
80460	0	a	Yeah
80461	0	a	but
80462	0	a	Well we come back to the drawing board then , huh ?
80463	0	a	It is silly cause we we should have had this meeting before we start drawing .
80464	1	a	Yeah or spe special form ?
80465	0	a	Yeah .
80466	0	a	Yeah .
80467	0	a	S what what is special
80468	0	a	f
80469	0	a	Oh yeah , special form .
80470	0	a	Maybe that is nicer .
80471	0	a	But we do not have any buttons .
80472	0	a	So do
80473	1	a	d make it a special colour then .
80474	0	a	Yeah .
80475	0	a	But it is it is for the integrated button , I think also .
80476	0	a	Or Yeah .
80477	0	a	Yeah
80478	1	a	ma make it a special colour then .
80479	0	a	Okay .
80480	0	a	Yeah .
80481	0	a	So
80482	0	a	Yeah ?
80483	0	a	So
80484	0	a	Woah we are within budget .
80485	1	a	Okay .
80486	1	a	Make it a special colour
80487	1	a	and then it look fancy .
80488	0	a	Yep .
80489	0	a	So
80490	0	a	Yeah .
80491	0	a	It is a miracle .
80492	0	a	Oh just
80493	1	a	oh ma make it two special colours , but we only have one button .
80494	1	a	Let is let is save it .
80495	0	a	Yeah .
80496	0	a	Okay .
80497	1	a	Let is do it like this ,
80498	0	a	I mean , because it does not lose our identity of the product as we
80499	0	a	Yeah all your designs are pretty much
80500	0	a	Yeah
80501	0	a	but that
80502	0	a	but that is the fun part of it .
80503	0	a	Yeah ?
80504	0	a	Okay .
80505	0	a	, well
80506	0	a	Kay , this was old .
80507	0	a	Yeah .
80508	0	a	Yeah back to work
80509	0	a	Okay .
80510	0	a	Did I save it ?
80511	0	a	Yeah .
80512	0	a	I I wanted to go , but I was not allowed .
80513	0	a	Oh yeah ? okay .
80514	0	a	So I just forgot to save this .
80515	0	a	Alright .
80516	0	a	Just a minute .
80517	0	a	Yeah what is the next phase ?
80518	0	a	the agenda .
80519	0	a	Yeah , this the last phase of course , so
80520	0	a	By your humble PM .
80521	0	a	Oh f Frustrated .
80522	0	a	Oh .
80523	0	a	Alright .
80524	0	a	Yeah .
80525	0	a	Okay .
80526	0	a	Well we first should have had a prototype presentation .
80527	0	a	But well as you saw that had not made no sense , because we had to drop it .
80528	0	a	Drop everything .
80529	0	a	Drop , yeah .
80530	0	a	Yeah .
80531	0	a	Yeah .
80532	0	a	We went straight into finance ?
80533	0	a	For
80534	0	a	Yeah .
80535	0	a	Yeah it was more important , so I just pushed up the agenda .
80536	0	a	Yeah .
80537	0	a	Yeah .
80538	0	a	Yeah .
80539	0	a	evaluation criteria .
80540	0	a	You have t produced something about that ?
80541	0	a	you put it in the .
80542	0	a	Yeah that that is
80543	0	a	Yeah .
80544	0	a	I I sure did .
80545	0	a	And it combines with product evaluation .
80546	0	a	so
80547	0	a	We all have to keep in mind what has changed now .
80548	0	a	So what we have left on the Because evaluation is based on the initial user requirements .
80549	0	a	Yeah .
80550	0	a	Alright .
80551	0	a	F five .
80552	1	a	Let is make it big .
80553	0	a	Well we evaluate the design with a seven point scale , as following .
80554	0	a	Well the remote controls according criteria .
80555	0	a	True or false , and then on a scale of seven points , a scale , as we all know it .
80556	0	a	Well the criteria are based on the user requirements , the trends from the marketing research , and the marketing strategy of the company itself .
80557	0	a	well they are in a Word document ,
80558	1	a	which I will open now .
80559	0	a	Alt up
80560	0	a	Freaky .
80561	0	a	Yeah .
80562	0	a	I do not know it is open yet .
80563	0	a	No .
80564	0	a	And we all have to agree on a certain level .
80565	0	a	What is this ?
80566	0	a	Oh .
80567	0	a	I do not know .
80568	0	a	Well the first point is the remote control matches the operating behaviour of the young user .
80569	0	a	So that means the operating behaviour was using quite a lot of functions .
80570	0	a	How do you think about that ?
80571	0	a	Yeah
80572	0	a	the us u
80573	0	a	It it
80574	0	a	it is it is mainly con mainly concentrating on a lot of functions , in this question .
80575	0	a	I think it does .
80576	0	a	Because the operating behaviour of the young user was also defined in colour and shape and the use of LCD ,
80577	0	a	right ?
80578	0	a	Yeah .
80579	0	a	Yeah .
80580	0	a	, of course we dropped a little bit of those
80581	0	a	So do you think
80582	0	a	Yeah .
80583	0	a	Well , we have extended menus , on the on the LCD screen .
80584	0	a	You can you can ma
80585	0	a	Yeah , you can make a lot of extended menus .
80586	0	a	Yep .
80587	0	a	So
80588	0	a	I
80589	0	a	No .
80590	0	a	That is true .
80591	0	a	I mean the the possibilities are almost unlimited , to to build in menus in the screen .
80592	0	a	So on a scale from one to seven , what do you think ?
80593	0	a	Huh ?
80594	0	a	Two or three ?
80595	0	a	Something like that ?
80596	0	a	Well we have to choose one .
80597	0	a	Two or three .
80598	0	a	Two or three .
80599	0	a	Two .
80600	0	a	Yeah .
80601	0	a	So what do you say ?
80602	0	a	I agree on two .
80603	1	a	y we should fill this in now .
80604	0	a	Yeah .
80605	0	a	Yeah okay .
80606	0	a	I I say two , personally .
80607	0	a	Yeah in the new design I s would say it is three .
80608	0	a	But Yeah well we have to evaluate I guess what we have now .
80609	0	a	Yeah .
80610	0	a	Yeah alright .
80611	0	a	But now , in original design I say two .
80612	0	a	Okay then I say three .
80613	0	a	Yeah ?
80614	0	a	You say three , and
80615	0	a	you you said al also three ?
80616	0	a	Three ?
80617	0	a	Okay well I say still two , but it has to be three then .
80618	0	a	Yeah yeah .
80619	0	a	Yeah .
80620	0	a	Hey , you are marketing , eh .
80621	0	a	Yeah I know .
80622	0	a	So it is made bold .
80623	0	a	But it is nah , it is not very clear on the sc
80624	0	a	Maybe other colour , yeah .
80625	1	a	M maybe underline .
80626	1	a	Or give it a colour .
80627	0	a	That is better .
80628	0	a	Yeah .
80629	1	a	Red .
80630	0	a	Alright .
80631	0	a	Oh , it does not have to be bold anymore .
80632	0	a	Alright .
80633	0	a	Oh yeah very true .
80634	0	a	Yeah .
80635	0	a	Yeah true one .
80636	0	a	well the remote control has Wha
80637	0	a	The remote control has irrelevant or less used functions .
80638	0	a	He types everything .
80639	0	a	Definitely one .
80640	0	a	Yeah .
80641	0	a	It has to be .
80642	0	a	For example audio settings and screen settings .
80643	0	a	It hides basic functions .
80644	0	a	Everything .
80645	0	a	You do not use anything else .
80646	0	a	Yeah .
80647	0	a	Well , yeah .
80648	0	a	So it it is a very true point .
80649	0	a	You are not going to find them .
80650	0	a	I mean it hides all those function .
80651	0	a	Yeah .
80652	0	a	Yeah okay .
80653	0	a	Yeah .
80654	0	a	Yeah true .
80655	0	a	But , I mean they are hidden in the screen .
80656	0	a	If you do not want to use them , you do not s
80657	0	a	you s just scroll over them .
80658	0	a	And you place them F
80659	0	a	I do not know where .
80660	0	a	So that is very true , I guess , for our case .
80661	0	a	the second point .
80662	0	a	Yeah the next Not so much so .
80663	0	a	It shows the relevant and most used functions .
80664	0	a	Nope .
80665	0	a	Power button .
80666	0	a	Do we ha still have a power button ?
80667	0	a	Well yeah the button is integrated , huh ?
80668	0	a	Yeah we dropped it .
80669	1	a	check with the Excel sheet .
80670	0	a	Yeah .
80671	0	a	I think we are
80672	0	a	It is in
80673	0	a	Oh yeah it was integrateds .
80674	0	a	Yeah it is it is integrated .
80675	0	a	You j you just push it in for
80676	0	a	Yeah just just push it in for th for three seconds or something , and then
80677	0	a	Yeah .
80678	0	a	Yeah integrate it .
80679	0	a	Yeah .
80680	0	a	E exactly just like a m mobile .
80681	0	a	Yeah .
80682	0	a	I do not know .
80683	0	a	Just go scrolling and it will activate .
80684	0	a	Yeah .
80685	0	a	it shows the relevant and most used functions .
80686	0	a	Yeah on the other
80687	0	a	on one side I would say yes , and the other side I would say no .
80688	0	a	So it is I do not know .
80689	0	a	It shows the most used functions and they are relevant , but
80690	0	a	You say you double click on the
80691	0	a	No , not anymore .
80692	0	a	Can you change channels directly with with just one button ?
80693	0	a	No , you have to scroll through the menu , before
80694	0	a	Yeah .
80695	0	a	Yeah .
80696	0	a	With the scroll butt
80697	0	a	Yeah and then say channel .
80698	0	a	And then
80699	0	a	Yeah .
80700	0	a	So it is it is not
80701	0	a	No .
80702	1	a	Well we should b build it so that if you do not kind of push into the menu or something , if When it is on , yeah , it is turned on , It automatically has the the programme and the volume function , but as soon as you click it you go into the menu or some
80703	0	a	Of you
80704	1	a	Or you double click it .
80705	0	a	Yeah .
80706	0	a	But but how do you change from volume to channel ?
80707	0	a	No .
80708	0	a	No because it has four arrows ,
80709	0	a	right ?
80710	0	a	Oh yeah .
80711	0	a	Because he is now have a scroll wheel that you can push in .
80712	0	a	Yeah .
80713	0	a	Yeah I was thinking still about our integrated joystick .
80714	0	a	Like on the the mouse .
80715	0	a	No we have n we have no buttons left .
80716	0	a	So the joystick was not an option .
80717	0	a	Say .
80718	0	a	Yeah that is a bummer .
80719	0	a	So so you hav
80720	0	a	So you you have to double click ,
80721	0	a	I mean , for , I mean , volume , and three double click for the menu , or something .
80722	0	a	Yeah .
80723	0	a	To get into menu .
80724	0	a	Yeah .
80725	0	a	Oh no .
80726	0	a	Yeah .
80727	0	a	Or hold it ten seconds .
80728	0	a	Yeah .
80729	0	a	Yeah .
80730	0	a	Alright .
80731	0	a	We will make it a Morse code .
80732	0	a	But but ease of use was not very important , may I remind you .
80733	0	a	No no no .
80734	0	a	So that is
80735	0	a	Yeah but that that is not a question .
80736	0	a	it should be trendy .
80737	0	a	the remote control shows the relevant and most used functions .
80738	0	a	Well I think it is pretty much in the middle .
80739	0	a	Yeah .
80740	0	a	Four .
80741	0	a	You have to search for them in in the in the s in the screen , in the menu .
80742	0	a	Yeah , im in the menu .
80743	0	a	So So maybe it is more like a f a five .
80744	0	a	Yeah .
80745	0	a	Seven .
80746	0	a	Yeah .
80747	0	a	Or Yeah .
80748	0	a	Yeah I would go for five or six , yeah .
80749	0	a	Five .
80750	0	a	Five or six ?
80751	0	a	Five ?
80752	0	a	Alright .
80753	0	a	Five .
80754	0	a	Okay five .
80755	0	a	Five .
80756	0	a	Yep .
80757	0	a	Let is not diss our remote .
80758	0	a	Yeah .
80759	0	a	It is the weirdest remote control I have ever seen .
80760	0	a	Oh .
80761	0	a	So Well it is different .
80762	0	a	Yeah .
80763	0	a	Yep .
80764	0	a	Just one button .
80765	0	a	Yeah .
80766	0	a	Alright .
80767	0	a	the the remote control makes use of technolog technological innovation like LCD screen and speech recognition .
80768	0	a	But yep .
80769	0	a	Yeah .
80770	0	a	Well yeah
80771	0	a	but we dropped the speech recognition .
80772	0	a	Yeah , it is still
80773	0	a	Yeah , I say two .
80774	0	a	But it has at least one innovation .
80775	0	a	I say two then .
80776	0	a	Yeah .
80777	0	a	We still have the fruit and vegetable print .
80778	0	a	Yeah but that that is not that is not this question .
80779	0	a	Oh , that is the next .
80780	0	a	Fr Oh I mean the Oh never mind .
80781	0	a	thi that is the other question .
80782	0	a	I am a bit lost .
80783	0	a	This one .
80784	0	a	I think a two .
80785	0	a	Two .
80786	0	a	Two yeah .
80787	0	a	No .
80788	0	a	I think LCD is more useful than speech
80789	0	a	What ?
80790	0	a	Oh not the bold one .
80791	0	a	Yep .
80792	0	a	Yeah definitely .
80793	0	a	It is way more practical , yeah .
80794	0	a	Right .
80795	0	a	Okay , it has a fancy look and feel by using fruit and vegetable prints , primary colours and sponge like material .
80796	0	a	It should have been two questions .
80797	0	a	Yeah .
80798	0	a	I realise now , because sponge like material is dropped .
80799	0	a	But the look and feel
80800	0	a	Yeah .
80801	0	a	You still have rubber d
80802	0	a	Or no .
80803	0	a	Yeah .
80804	0	a	So we still we still have the primary colours .
80805	0	a	No you got a plastic .
80806	0	a	Yeah .
80807	0	a	But only on the on the outside , not on the button .
80808	0	a	Yeah .
80809	0	a	The button has also colour .
80810	0	a	Yeah ?
80811	0	a	Okay .
80812	0	a	Yeah .
80813	0	a	Yeah .
80814	0	a	The one button we have .
80815	0	a	Yeah .
80816	0	a	Yeah .
80817	0	a	Yeah still we we dropped also on the the double curve .
80818	0	a	The one .
80819	1	a	Yeah you could check with the Excel sheet .
80820	0	a	Yeah .
80821	0	a	You only have one
80822	0	a	Yeah .
80823	0	a	Yeah we have single curve now , and no and no material
80824	0	a	And and colour .
80825	0	a	Yeah .
80826	0	a	S
80827	0	a	Yeah .
80828	0	a	So maybe in the middle or something .
80829	0	a	Four .
80830	0	a	Yeah .
80831	0	a	Yeah .
80832	0	a	Yeah , I mean it is
80833	0	a	worth the Yeah .
80834	0	a	Yeah or three .
80835	0	a	Actually we d we did not do so well on this one .
80836	0	a	We have something .
80837	0	a	Because it is basically an old one , with little curve on the side , and in a different colour .
80838	0	a	Still , it is still hard .
80839	0	a	Yeah .
80840	0	a	I mean the sponge like and the three D shape , that would give it something young and fresh .
80841	0	a	New .
80842	0	a	Yeah .
80843	0	a	Yeah .
80844	0	a	But then we would have to drop the screen .
80845	0	a	Red .
80846	0	a	Oh red .
80847	0	a	Yeah .
80848	0	a	You like both .
80849	0	a	Yeah .
80850	0	a	I like bold .
80851	0	a	the remote control displays the corporate logo .
80852	0	a	oh yeah .
80853	0	a	yeah yeah .
80854	0	a	Of course .
80855	0	a	Yeah .
80856	0	a	I just could not
80857	0	a	, just one minute .
80858	1	a	You just have to draw it .
80859	0	a	Yeah but it
80860	0	a	be because we could not hardly draw on the b s on the lower half of the screen , we could not make it big enough to actually draw in
80861	0	a	the So I mean I wanted to put digits on the buttons as well .
80862	0	a	It is the white part
80863	0	a	Yeah .
80864	0	a	Yeah .
80865	0	a	We have a we have a
80866	0	a	So .
80867	0	a	But
80868	0	a	Hell
80869	0	a	yeah .
80870	0	a	But there is enough space for the corporate logo .
80871	0	a	I mean , if there is only one thing .
80872	0	a	If we have only one button .
80873	0	a	Yeah .
80874	0	a	So I will say that is very true .
80875	0	a	And even the shape we have now simulates kind of an R and the reversed R ,
80876	0	a	does not it ?
80877	0	a	So
80878	0	a	No .
80879	0	a	Yeah .
80880	0	a	The remote control is easy to use .
80881	0	a	Well I would say Skill
80882	0	a	, I would say six , or something .
80883	0	a	I do not think it is easy to use , or not so .
80884	0	a	The only e the only thing easy about it is that you do not have to move your fingers .
80885	0	a	i
80886	0	a	And that you only have to control one button .
80887	0	a	Yeah .
80888	0	a	Cause it has only one button .
80889	0	a	Yeah exactly .
80890	0	a	Yeah .
80891	0	a	It it
80892	0	a	it has a nice screen .
80893	0	a	But Yeah .
80894	0	a	It gives visual feedback .
80895	0	a	So I think a five .
80896	0	a	Yeah .
80897	0	a	Well I I would say a five or a six .
80898	0	a	I would say six .
80899	0	a	Five .
80900	0	a	What do you say ?
80901	0	a	Easy to use ?
80902	0	a	Five or a six ?
80903	0	a	So a six , more .
80904	0	a	It is really not easy to use .
80905	0	a	Cause you are putting everything
80906	0	a	Most votes count .
80907	0	a	No not anymore .
80908	0	a	Yeah .
80909	0	a	Yeah , I would go for the six too .
80910	0	a	Okay .
80911	0	a	Yeah .
80912	0	a	So
80913	0	a	well , another question ,
80914	0	a	the remote control is durable .
80915	0	a	Definitely in casing , cause we have a hard plastic
80916	0	a	Yeah .
80917	0	a	Yeah that looks great .
80918	0	a	I do not know if that is the correct word .
80919	0	a	Yeah .
80920	0	a	But
80921	0	a	In use , both battery as casing ?
80922	0	a	Yeah ?
80923	0	a	True , true .
80924	0	a	Nah
80925	0	a	Yep .
80926	0	a	Yeah because the the batteries , those thingies last forever .
80927	0	a	And the the casing , hard plastic also lasts forever .
80928	0	a	And the casing is plastic , ?
80929	0	a	Yeah .
80930	0	a	Yeah .
80931	0	a	If you do not drop it too much , it is should last pretty long .
80932	0	a	So I would go for one .
80933	0	a	Yeah ?
80934	0	a	But I think rubber compared is better .
80935	0	a	Yeah .
80936	0	a	S Yep .
80937	0	a	So I think a two is more appropriate
80938	0	a	than
80939	0	a	Yeah .
80940	0	a	Okay yeah .
80941	0	a	Wow .
80942	0	a	Logo .
80943	0	a	Yeah .
80944	0	a	Okay I will go go for two .
80945	0	a	the last one ?
80946	0	a	The remote control is a good example for company is motto , we put the fashion in electronics .
80947	0	a	Oh .
80948	0	a	No m
80949	0	a	I would g
80950	0	a	I would go for four .
80951	0	a	No we put the electronics into the fashion .
80952	0	a	turn around .
80953	0	a	Yeah .
80954	0	a	Yeah
80955	0	a	well yeah .
80956	0	a	But
80957	0	a	Yeah ?
80958	0	a	It is not
80959	0	a	Yeah , true .
80960	0	a	No
80961	0	a	Yeah okay .
80962	0	a	Because we kind of tried to but we kind of failed with the budget that we have .
80963	0	a	So a four .
80964	0	a	It is it g
80965	0	a	it g goes , it is not the best we could do , I guess .
80966	0	a	Yeah .
80967	0	a	But it all has to do with the budget , because it is it is not the bad idea we had ,
80968	0	a	so Alright
80969	0	a	, yeah .
80970	0	a	Yeah .
80971	0	a	Yeah yeah .
80972	0	a	Yeah , four is okay .
80973	0	a	Right .
80974	0	a	So
80975	0	a	Ooh .
80976	0	a	So if I understood it right , we have to count these numbers .
80977	0	a	That is it .
80978	0	a	And Yeah ?
80979	0	a	What ?
80980	0	a	Yeah .
80981	0	a	Yeah .
80982	0	a	Oh Oh Alright .
80983	0	a	Word document , the
80984	0	a	Yeah we have to count them .
80985	0	a	Yeah .
80986	0	a	That
80987	0	a	Count them .
80988	0	a	Yeah just add them and then divide them .
80989	0	a	Add them ?
80990	0	a	Or
80991	1	a	Could somebody start calculator ?
80992	0	a	Yeah .
80993	0	a	I all made it po
80994	0	a	I
80995	0	a	I all made it
80996	0	a	I all made it possible for a positive questions , so we can count it .
80997	0	a	we can do the math .
80998	0	a	Yeah .
80999	0	a	I mean if you have reversed question , you have to reverse the scale ,
81000	0	a	Yes .
81001	0	a	Yeah ,
81002	0	a	yeah .
81003	0	a	You have to Kay .
81004	0	a	So four and
81005	0	a	Nice work .
81006	0	a	Did you make this questionnaire or what ?
81007	0	a	Oh .
81008	0	a	Yeah .
81009	0	a	Thanks .
81010	0	a	Okay .
81011	0	a	Three plus ?
81012	0	a	Plus one .
81013	0	a	I would not be able to do it that fast .
81014	0	a	O one .
81015	0	a	Plus five .
81016	0	a	Plus five ?
81017	0	a	Oh .
81018	0	a	Bo
81019	0	a	two .
81020	0	a	Oh Easy .
81021	0	a	Question number four , yeah ?
81022	0	a	Yeah .
81023	0	a	F
81024	0	a	Pretty difficult .
81025	0	a	Four .

81027	0	a	Oh .
81028	0	a	It is it is gone wrong .
81029	0	a	How hard is it ?
81030	0	a	Yeah just use
81031	0	a	Oh there tho there is no
81032	0	a	n
81033	0	a	There is no num pads .

81036	1	a	Start over ?
81037	0	a	You can
81038	0	a	Oh yeah .
81039	0	a	No it is if you press twice on the plus button , then you get s
81040	0	a	s
81041	0	a	No .
81042	0	a	That is why it is Just count it to
81043	0	a	Yeah .
81044	0	a	It is a it is a bit
81045	0	a	Yeah .
81046	1	a	Just type in the digits .
81047	0	a	They are all one digit numbers right ?
81048	0	a	And then you can count them together .
81049	0	a	I think you can just count them by a
81050	1	a	let is move over .
81051	0	a	Okay .
81052	0	a	Three , plus one , four .
81053	0	a	Three , four , nine .
81054	0	a	Nine .
81055	0	a	Eleven , fifteen .
81056	0	a	, yeah .
81057	0	a	Are you here ?
81058	0	a	Eleven .
81059	0	a	Eleven .
81060	0	a	Fifteen .
81061	0	a	Fifteen .
81062	0	a	Sixteen .
81063	0	a	Sixteen .
81064	0	a	Sixteen , yeah .
81065	0	a	Seventeen .
81066	0	a	Seventeen .
81067	0	a	No sixteen .
81068	0	a	sixteen plus six .
81069	0	a	Oh what ?
81070	0	a	How hard is this ?
81071	0	a	Never mind .
81072	0	a	Twenty two .
81073	0	a	S
81074	0	a	That was the last one .
81075	0	a	Twenty two .
81076	0	a	Twenty two ,
81077	0	a	yeah ?
81078	0	a	Tw
81079	0	a	Twenty
81080	0	a	Twenty eight .
81081	0	a	Twenty four .
81082	0	a	Twenty four .
81083	0	a	Twenty six .
81084	0	a	Twenty eight .
81085	0	a	Oh , sorry .
81086	0	a	Oh my .
81087	0	a	That was that .
81088	0	a	Twenty eight .
81089	0	a	Yeah .
81090	0	a	Okay .
81091	0	a	Twenty eight .
81092	0	a	So divided by nine .
81093	0	a	Twen okay .
81094	0	a	By nine .
81095	0	a	That is three Or le less than a three .
81096	0	a	So
81097	0	a	Yeah .
81098	0	a	Yeah the lower the
81099	0	a	The lower the score the better , right ?
81100	0	a	Yeah
81101	0	a	but
81102	0	a	But
81103	0	a	I Are you sure we this number actually tells us somethings ?
81104	0	a	I do not think so because some questions are related to positive issues and some to negative .
81105	0	a	Yeah .
81106	0	a	Twenty eight
81107	0	a	di divided by nine
81108	0	a	makes three point one
81109	0	a	one one one one one one .
81110	0	a	Divided by nine .
81111	0	a	So thr t two .
81112	0	a	So we are better than average .
81113	0	a	Yeah .
81114	0	a	No .
81115	0	a	Some questions are Yeah .
81116	0	a	So if you give a true to a positive , it actually means that the low the lower the better .
81117	0	a	But if you give true to a negative question
81118	0	a	No ?
81119	0	a	Durable , that is good .
81120	0	a	Yeah , but there are no negative questions I guess .
81121	0	a	Good example .
81122	0	a	Durable use .
81123	0	a	Easy to use .
81124	0	a	Easy to use .
81125	0	a	This is good .
81126	0	a	Fancy look and feel ,
81127	0	a	that is good .
81128	0	a	Yeah .
81129	0	a	Technology innovation was good , because of a marketing requirement .
81130	0	a	Also good .
81131	0	a	Re relevant most used function .
81132	0	a	Yeah okay .
81133	0	a	I guess you did do it .
81134	0	a	And hides these functions .
81135	0	a	That was also a good thing .
81136	0	a	Oh yeah .
81137	0	a	Yeah .
81138	0	a	Oh yeah
81139	0	a	yeah .
81140	0	a	And then matches the opera of the user was also a good thing .
81141	0	a	No Okay .
81142	0	a	Yeah .
81143	0	a	So it were all positive questions , by by purpose .
81144	0	a	Okay .
81145	0	a	Yeah true .
81146	0	a	So Yes , so the It tells us something , yes .
81147	0	a	Becau But the picture would be a lot different if we did not have to drop those those things , I guess .
81148	0	a	Oh great .
81149	0	a	Things , yeah .
81150	0	a	Yeah definitely definitely .
81151	0	a	Okay .
81152	0	a	Because now it is just an average
81153	0	a	It is remote .
81154	0	a	Yeah .
81155	0	a	Nah it it is it is better than average , but
81156	0	a	Yeah .
81157	0	a	Yeah okay because of the LCD screen .
81158	0	a	But it looks and stuff , it still it is not , it is not really eye catching , except for the colour .
81159	0	a	So th
81160	0	a	Yeah .
81161	0	a	It is still yeah .
81162	0	a	Has some shortcomings .
81163	0	a	No .
81164	0	a	The colour and the screen .
81165	0	a	Yeah .
81166	0	a	Okay so this we had , this we had .
81167	0	a	Product evaluation .
81168	0	a	We have to do a product evaluation .
81169	0	a	prototype presentation we dropped .
81170	0	a	So the finance we looked .
81171	0	a	We have redesigned .
81172	0	a	not on that , but
81173	1	a	So you can just make one big LCD screen .
81174	1	a	Yeah we we have to maybe if we have to redesign it on this
81175	0	a	With some casing around it , yeah .
81176	1	a	Okay it is your turn now .
81177	1	a	Shall we try ?
81178	0	a	Black .
81179	0	a	Okay we are still going to go for the fancy colours ?
81180	0	a	But are we going to stick with the green or are we going to do blue ?
81181	0	a	One scroll button and
81182	0	a	For what ?
81183	1	a	Should give it some time ?
81184	0	a	Yay .
81185	0	a	Yeah
81186	0	a	The the button has a special colour , the frame has a special colour .
81187	0	a	Yeah .
81188	0	a	Yeah .
81189	1	a	Yeah we we can just use this one .
81190	1	a	And then over paint it with the green
81191	0	a	he only needs one button .
81192	0	a	Yeah .
81193	0	a	It is plastic .
81194	0	a	Yeah .
81195	1	a	Or we have to delete this one or
81196	0	a	Oh oh no .
81197	0	a	And single curved .
81198	0	a	Yeah .
81199	1	a	Oh and you might want to add a infrared LED .
81200	0	a	Oh yeah .
81201	0	a	Otherwise it does not function so well .
81202	0	a	Okay .
81203	0	a	Yeah .
81204	0	a	So that is
81205	0	a	Okay , but how do we make the the scroll button ?
81206	0	a	It is just one
81207	0	a	yeah .
81208	0	a	Do we have to do other things ?
81209	0	a	Or just redesign ?
81210	0	a	Alright .
81211	1	a	Well I have to make an report of every decision we made so far .
81212	0	a	And I try to get chip just before I receive the Excel sheet .
81213	0	a	Yeah .
81214	0	a	So I
81215	0	a	Yeah I am I am somewhere ,
81216	1	a	but maybe you can help me .
81217	0	a	So you made a start , right ?
81218	0	a	Yeah .
81219	0	a	I was here .
81220	0	a	So
81221	0	a	That is enough to get started with , so
81222	0	a	, I just took one for every step and then a conclusion .
81223	1	a	Have to take this away also .
81224	0	a	Alright .
81225	0	a	And this
81226	0	a	Oh yeah , of course .
81227	0	a	that is the infrared thing .
81228	0	a	The the target group has a weak spot for fruit and vegetables , like primary colours , spongy shape .
81229	0	a	Yeah .
81230	0	a	pen
81231	0	a	yeah ?
81232	0	a	Format .
81233	0	a	Current colour red .
81234	0	a	The playfulness , we decided to use kinetic energy as a power sour
81235	0	a	Okay .
81236	0	a	Oh Yeah we did our special colour for the Line widths , now that is a ten .
81237	0	a	Yeah .
81238	0	a	That is conceptual , yes .
81239	0	a	Yeah .
81240	0	a	, it is just a scroll
81241	1	a	Yeah , is it is horizontal or vertical ?
81242	1	a	I think
81243	0	a	Yeah .
81244	0	a	It is going to be one str scroll .
81245	0	a	How many pages ?
81246	0	a	Alright .
81247	0	a	Y you have you have done the first two .
81248	0	a	Horizontal is easier too ,
81249	0	a	cause you can
81250	0	a	Is it more natural than this ?
81251	0	a	So let is say
81252	0	a	Whoops .
81253	0	a	Yeah .
81254	0	a	Okay ,
81255	0	a	and and the look and feel is
81256	0	a	Yeah .
81257	1	a	Well I think I have to make a p an issue called finance .
81258	0	a	Yeah ,
81259	0	a	yeah .
81260	0	a	Kay .
81261	0	a	Yes .
81262	0	a	Basically .
81263	0	a	It does not look like it
81264	0	a	it is it is not
81265	0	a	Yeah .
81266	0	a	The items we had to drop .
81267	0	a	Yeah .
81268	0	a	It is not very fashionable anymore .
81269	0	a	But it is okay .
81270	0	a	It is really ugly .
81271	0	a	Yeah .
81272	0	a	Where did we start with price ?
81273	0	a	Twenty six and a half .
81274	1	a	Maybe m make it bigger ?
81275	1	a	Or
81276	0	a	Yeah .
81277	0	a	Or not ?
81278	0	a	Or twenty six ?
81279	0	a	Something like that .
81280	0	a	That looks little bit more
81281	1	a	Maybe that is a s a special colour for it .
81282	0	a	Oh
81283	0	a	What do you mean ?
81284	1	a	Like a other colour than this one ?
81285	0	a	Yeah can we do it
81286	0	a	can we do a print ?
81287	0	a	I think we have to choose ,
81288	0	a	yeah ?
81289	0	a	Okay special colour .
81290	0	a	This ?
81291	0	a	Speckles ?

81294	1	a	Or or speckles in it ?
81295	0	a	I dunno .
81296	0	a	I am not sure .
81297	0	a	I do not think so , if you see the options .
81298	0	a	But Yeah .
81299	0	a	We do have special colour .
81300	0	a	Does it mean that
81301	1	a	Shall we just give it some dots to make it look pretty ?
81302	0	a	Purdy .
81303	0	a	Yeah red is already a special colour , I think .
81304	0	a	So It is not very special , but
81305	0	a	Yeah .
81306	1	a	Just put the purple purple on it .
81307	0	a	Yeah .
81308	0	a	Some some big dots .

81439	0	a	Bug .
81440	0	a	No it is in inside the
81441	0	a	No it

81447	0	a	From up there ?
81448	0	a	No .
81449	0	a	B
81450	0	a	It is a normal TV screen , kind of thing .
81451	0	a	Hey , you have got it read only .
81452	0	a	Yeah it is somewhere in here .
81453	1	a	So you have to
81454	1	a	Save copy .
81455	0	a	Yeah .
81456	0	a	Strange .
81457	0	a	This something what is projection from behind , I guess .
81458	0	a	Yeah .
81459	0	a	It is too It is
81460	0	a	It is now single curved .
81461	0	a	Oh .
81462	0	a	Yeah there is some kind of projection I think .
81463	0	a	Yes .
81464	0	a	Yeah
81465	0	a	it it is a beamer , but then with a
81466	0	a	within a mirror , yeah .
81467	0	a	With a with a mirror , huh ?
81468	0	a	Or something .
81469	0	a	Yeah .
81470	0	a	So it looks like a big screen , but in fact it is not .
81471	1	a	So are we going to change anything to this ?
81472	0	a	I mean is it going to
81473	0	a	This is going to be flat .
81474	0	a	Well it is it is single single curved .
81475	0	a	Well
81476	1	a	now you probably have to recalibrate .
81477	0	a	So
81478	0	a	It is flat .
81479	0	a	Th this is flat .
81480	0	a	Yeah exactly .
81481	0	a	Oh no .
81482	0	a	Yeah .
81483	0	a	Okay .
81484	0	a	It does not matter .
81485	0	a	It is it is
81486	0	a	That is the detector for the
81487	0	a	Okay .
81488	0	a	But it is it is better to have in the front , this kind of shape , because it looks nice .
81489	0	a	I mean you see more of this than of that .
81490	0	a	Yeah .
81491	0	a	Yeah , more like that .
81492	0	a	Yeah .
81493	0	a	And this is also going to be
81494	0	a	Nope .
81495	0	a	It is not very ideal .
81496	1	a	Do like this .
81497	0	a	But sometimes then all of a sudden it does work .
81498	0	a	Yeah .
81499	0	a	What is this ?
81500	0	a	Ooh .
81501	0	a	But I do not see a detector over there .
81502	0	a	Maybe
81503	0	a	No it is
81504	0	a	I think you only need two points .
81505	0	a	Yeah .
81506	0	a	I do not know .
81507	0	a	Or not .
81508	0	a	No , you sh
81509	0	a	Slanted
81510	0	a	yeah .
81511	0	a	I thought it was a kind of thing to put it on , and then draw right lines or something .
81512	0	a	Maybe that is why it is it is not working , because it is more
81513	0	a	Yeah .
81514	0	a	Yeah .
81515	0	a	Yeah .
81516	0	a	Or just messed it up .
81517	0	a	Well maybe .
81518	0	a	Oh .
81519	0	a	Oh yeah .
81520	0	a	Yeah it it matters for the aim of this thing .
81521	0	a	Yeah .
81522	0	a	Yeah .
81523	0	a	Yeah but it was not good .
81524	0	a	You have to make it s ninety degrees .
81525	0	a	Yeah it it has to touch the corners , I guess .
81526	0	a	But th this one was not good , because if I was drawing here , I drew a line
81527	0	a	and then it came over here .
81528	0	a	You have
81529	0	a	Oh we are always long .
81530	0	a	Oh , five minutes to the end of the meeting .
81531	0	a	Oh .
81532	0	a	And the recalibration is done using this icon here .
81533	0	a	Yeah ,
81534	0	a	can we t can we get to that i
81535	0	a	Oh it is not working anymore .
81536	0	a	Ooh .
81537	0	a	Yeah
81538	0	a	well I just
81539	0	a	Okay .
81540	0	a	Oh yeah
81541	0	a	yeah
81542	0	a	yeah
81543	0	a	yeah
81544	0	a	, it is it is working , it is working .
81545	0	a	Yeah
81546	0	a	yeah , it is it is okay .
81547	0	a	It is working again .
81548	0	a	Yeah .
81549	0	a	It is better than before .
81550	0	a	Yeah .
81551	0	a	Yeah .
81552	0	a	We are improving
81553	0	a	Yeah .
81554	1	a	You go ahead .
81555	0	a	Yeah that is improved pretty much .
81556	0	a	Yeah .
81557	0	a	Yeah it is only a bit like to that side ,
81558	0	a	but that is that one by the way .
81559	0	a	Yeah .
81560	0	a	Yeah but it is better , it is better
81561	0	a	Cause this one makes the angle either like this .
81562	0	a	No it
81563	0	a	So cake .
81564	0	a	So i if I change this , it will go there , if I change that , will go there .
81565	0	a	No .
81566	0	a	It is better than it was I guess .
81567	1	a	I will take this away cause it looks messy .
81568	0	a	Silly .
81569	0	a	Yeah .
81570	0	a	Works pretty well .
81571	0	a	Five minutes before the meeting is over .
81572	0	a	Yeah .
81573	0	a	And then ?
81574	0	a	We have to present
81575	0	a	Alright .
81576	0	a	Yeah .
81577	1	a	Then I have to write this ,
81578	0	a	and I do not know if you have to present , because I did not receive any information about that so far .
81579	0	a	Maybe we will .
81580	0	a	Maybe we get a a final mail .
81581	0	a	So it after the
81582	0	a	after after these five minutes , you have to
81583	0	a	Alright .
81584	0	a	Yeah .
81585	0	a	Yeah , I have still ten minutes to finish the report .
81586	0	a	What is this anyway ?
81587	0	a	It looks like candle wax .
81588	0	a	After after that five minutes , you have ten minutes to finish it , or
81589	0	a	Alright .
81590	0	a	Yeah .
81591	0	a	And we
81592	0	a	Right .
81593	1	a	And you can just relax and have cup of coffee or
81594	0	a	oh no , they do not have beer here
81595	0	a	so you ca not celebrate .
81596	0	a	Chill .
81597	0	a	Huh .
81598	1	a	You can just if you ma finish my presentation please .
81599	0	a	over there .
81600	0	a	Yeah ?
81601	0	a	Next slide .
81602	0	a	The presentation is still open .
81603	1	a	So if you finish that then you will see
81604	0	a	Yeah next .
81605	0	a	Oh yeah , we have to do the project evaluation .
81606	1	a	Just do that quickly .
81607	0	a	Yeah ?
81608	0	a	How do you do it ?
81609	0	a	Alright .
81610	0	a	well basically what that says , we discuss it and
81611	0	a	So how were did the project process go ?
81612	0	a	Did you , were you all pleased with the process as it was ?
81613	0	a	Or are there
81614	0	a	Yeah the interaction and the steps we followed , and and so forth .
81615	0	a	th do you mean the the interaction between us ?
81616	0	a	Or
81617	0	a	Yeah well at first I was really stressed .
81618	0	a	Because it went a bit fast .
81619	0	a	Yeah .
81620	0	a	But then as I knew the tempo that I had to be on , the second time I think I did a bit better .
81621	0	a	Yeah .
81622	0	a	Yeah .
81623	0	a	And the third time yeah , I mean
81624	0	a	Yeah ,
81625	0	a	yeah
81626	0	a	yeah
81627	0	a	yeah .
81628	0	a	And we move more to to working together as team , because at first you you make your individual contribution , and then come here , and you have no idea what the others have to make .
81629	0	a	No .
81630	0	a	No .
81631	0	a	And then finally you have some idea ,
81632	0	a	okay this is going to w
81633	0	a	this is what we going to make together
81634	0	a	and okay I will arrange this and you will arrange that , and you have a k a kind of idea what you can expect on the next half hour when you have to work on your own .
81635	0	a	So The process , I mean , the interaction between us became better and better I guess .
81636	0	a	Yeah we
81637	0	a	Yeah .
81638	0	a	Yeah .
81639	0	a	Especially after the first meeting .
81640	0	a	Yeah , especially if f f if you see you se
81641	0	a	you saw the largest difference from the first to the second meeting I guess .
81642	0	a	And
81643	0	a	Yeah .
81644	0	a	Yeah .
81645	0	a	Definitely .
81646	0	a	Okay and was that due to my leadership ?
81647	0	a	Yeah ?
81648	0	a	That
81649	0	a	okay ?
81650	0	a	Okay .
81651	0	a	Yeah
81652	0	a	yeah
81653	0	a	yeah .
81654	0	a	Well you did become more assertive the the second time round , so that
81655	0	a	Yeah .
81656	0	a	Yeah .
81657	0	a	Yeah .
81658	0	a	You were more in charge kind of thing .
81659	0	a	was there enough room for creativity ?
81660	0	a	So and the about the board digital pen ?
81661	0	a	was that helpful or
81662	0	a	Ooh .
81663	0	a	I guess so .
81664	0	a	Yeah .
81665	0	a	Yeah but only the the financial parts
81666	0	a	Yeah .
81667	0	a	I mean I
81668	0	a	We were pretty democratic .
81669	0	a	Li Limiteded afterwards , but If if you do not take that into account , there is plenty of room for creativ creativity .
81670	0	a	Also not only the drawing and the the making of the thing itself , but also in explaining it to the other people , by means of the the board and PowerPoint and Word and stuff like that .
81671	0	a	Yeah .
81672	0	a	I think in in essence the digital pen is better than the SMARTboard .
81673	0	a	Because it it it just works better .
81674	0	a	I mean I have made
81675	0	a	yeah , I have made several notes just to test it , and and just put the pen in into it , and then it came onto my screen and it looked perfectly .
81676	0	a	Yeah it works .
81677	0	a	Yeah .
81678	0	a	So it it is better a better device than than the screen .
81679	0	a	Maybe Yeah .
81680	0	a	But the screen is useful , in essence , but it does not work that well .
81681	0	a	It is it is
81682	0	a	The the pen is more intuitive , cause we are all used to writing with pen .
81683	0	a	Use the pen .
81684	0	a	And as I said , I have no idea how PowerPoint works , so will take me half a day to be able to make a normal PowerPoint presentation .
81685	0	a	Yeah .
81686	0	a	But once I get to know the program probably , I mean , it looks better , you know .
81687	0	a	Or something like that .
81688	0	a	You can give it a kind of a home style , like we have i the the logo and everything .
81689	0	a	Yeah yeah .
81690	0	a	And I do not know .
81691	0	a	Yep .
81692	0	a	Blink .
81693	0	a	Oh .
81694	0	a	Warning .
81695	0	a	Finish meeting now .
81696	0	a	Finish meeting .
81697	0	a	Okay , are are there any new ideas about this ?
81698	0	a	All I think I did not really receive , yeah .
81699	0	a	Well , it
81700	0	a	It is use especially useful , I guess , to to evaluate designs and graph graphical stuff .
81701	0	a	w
81702	0	a	S sorry
81703	0	a	And and
81704	0	a	the screen and stuff like that .
81705	0	a	I think the PowerPoint is is too limited .
81706	0	a	You ca not draw easy in in PowerPoint .
81707	0	a	It has to be yeah .
81708	0	a	The drawing board has to be integrated into PowerPoint , so that you can just easily
81709	0	a	Yeah .
81710	0	a	Yeah .
81711	0	a	Yeah the the the problem with PowerPoint for me is that you have to i put in the pre made chunks c as well .
81712	0	a	You know , you can draw something on the sketch board and then take it there , or whatever .
81713	0	a	Yeah .
81714	0	a	Yeah .
81715	0	a	Yeah .
81716	0	a	But it it is useful to to show something to to an a small audience , and then to Yeah .
81717	0	a	Yeah just for text , for text it is it is okay .
81718	0	a	But
81719	0	a	Kay .
81720	0	a	These these kind of screens this size are useful to discuss things .
81721	0	a	So
81722	1	a	Yes .
81723	0	a	Oh .
81724	1	a	Check your email .

81749	0	a	Good morning .
81750	1	a	before I start with the with the meeting I have a few things to tell you about the the setting we are in ,
81751	0	a	because we are being watched by Big Brother .
81752	0	a	So
81753	0	a	Yeah .
81754	0	a	By Big Brother ?
81755	0	a	Okay .
81756	0	a	Yeah .
81757	0	a	This
81758	0	a	These are cameras , so are these .
81759	0	a	This thing that looks like a pie , are actually all microphones .
81760	0	a	Yeah .
81761	0	a	Okay .
81762	0	a	So
81763	1	a	you must be careful with with all this .
81764	0	a	And as I can see you you have placed your laptops exactly on the place where it must be .
81765	0	a	And that has to do with the camera settings , so we do not have our laptops in front of the cameras .
81766	0	a	Of our faces .
81767	0	a	And
81768	0	a	Indeed .
81769	0	a	So they can see our faces .

81774	0	a	first a little opening .
81775	0	a	I will introduce myself ,
81776	0	a	and I think it is very good to introduce yourself .
81777	0	a	then a little bit of acquaintance , acquaintance to to to ourselves .
81778	1	a	So we get to know each other .
81779	0	a	that will be done with a tool training from the he these two smart boards .
81780	0	a	Then the project plan .
81781	0	a	What we are going to do , and how we are going to do it .
81782	0	a	and discussion about that and a little closing at the end .
81783	0	a	Okay ,
81784	0	a	my name is Danny Wolfs .
81785	0	a	I am the Project Manager .
81786	0	a	What is your name ?
81787	0	a	User interface , okay .
81788	0	a	I am Juergen Toffs .
81789	0	a	I am the User Interface Designer .
81790	0	a	Hi ,
81791	0	a	my name is .
81792	0	a	I am the Industrial Designer .
81793	0	a	Industrial , yes .
81794	0	a	I am Tim .
81795	0	a	my function is the Marketing Expert .
81796	0	a	Okay ,
81797	0	a	thank you .
81798	1	a	First a little about the project aim .
81799	0	a	the the the aim is to make a new remote control .
81800	0	a	maybe you have read read the website .
81801	0	a	It is a very , yeah , very ambitious company .
81802	0	a	They they want to do something else .
81803	0	a	I w
81804	0	a	there must be a new remote control .
81805	0	a	first of all it must be original , and trendy .
81806	0	a	That is two things really close to each other .
81807	0	a	But at the same time user friendly .
81808	0	a	And they have
81809	0	a	Yeah ,
81810	0	a	that is very important for them .
81811	0	a	there are three stages .
81812	0	a	There is a functional design .
81813	0	a	So
81814	0	a	what are we going to to do ?
81815	0	a	What are we going to make f kind of functions in the remote ?
81816	0	a	And why are we going to do it ?
81817	0	a	Then the conceptual design .
81818	0	a	How are going to do it ?
81819	0	a	And that is really global .
81820	1	a	because at the detailed design , how , part two , we go to dig in really about how the the te the technical of If it is it is possible technical wise .
81821	0	a	each stage is is broken up in two two stages , individual work and a meeting .
81822	0	a	So it is it is very straightforward .
81823	0	a	Okay ,
81824	1	a	the tool training .
81825	0	a	We have two smart boards .
81826	0	a	This one is for the presentations , the PowerPoint presentations or the Word presentation of whatever you you had .
81827	0	a	and this is only for drawing .
81828	0	a	So
81829	1	a	we must let it stand on this this programme .
81830	0	a	This is called a smart board thing
81831	0	a	Yeah ,
81832	0	a	it speaks for itself .
81833	0	a	Speaks for itself .
81834	0	a	and as you may have heard , the documents in the shared folder can be showed on this screen .
81835	0	a	Not in y the the My Documents .
81836	1	a	So if you want to show something , put it in the shared folder .
81837	0	a	This is very straightforward , with the save , the print , the undo , the blank , the select , the pen .
81838	0	a	Well ,
81839	1	a	I do not going to explain it all ,
81840	0	a	because I think you know how it works .
81841	1	a	we must not forget everything we draw on here , all must be saved .
81842	1	a	We we may not delete anything .
81843	1	a	So if you have drawn something , save it .
81844	1	a	Never delete it .
81845	0	a	That is a very important thing .
81846	0	a	Okay .
81847	1	a	little little kind of exercise to know each other .
81848	1	a	At the white board on the left .
81849	1	a	Every every one of us must draw our favourite animal , and tell tell us why we had chosen that animal .
81850	1	a	important is that we use different colours , and different pen widths .
81851	1	a	Widths .
81852	1	a	Widths .
81853	1	a	I have a question .
81854	1	a	Yes ?
81855	0	a	Yeah .
81856	0	a	this exercise , did the company board tell you to do it , or did you just make it up yourself ?
81857	0	a	It is part of the introduction ,
81858	0	a	okay .
81859	0	a	No no no .
81860	0	a	It is it is I I
81861	0	a	I must do it .
81862	0	a	Yeah ,
81863	0	a	yeah ,
81864	0	a	yeah .
81865	0	a	Cause we really do not know each other , and it is kind of new .
81866	1	a	So getting used to each other , we can have a little fun then , before we dig in really to the hard stuff .
81867	0	a	Okay .
81868	0	a	That kind of thing .
81869	1	a	Would you start with drawing your favourite animal ?
81870	0	a	Okay , okay .
81871	0	a	, yeah .
81872	0	a	I do not know really how it works .
81873	1	a	But maybe you can show us first ?
81874	0	a	You g you get electrocuted or
81875	0	a	It is like Pictionary ?
81876	0	a	The the one who says it first gets a raise .
81877	0	a	Yeah , okay .
81878	0	a	Drawing goes with this thing .
81879	1	a	Do not touch your hand on this little thingy here .
81880	0	a	That is important .
81881	1	a	So hold it like this .
81882	0	a	Yeah , kind of .
81883	0	a	So ,
81884	1	a	You must p p push a little Good .
81885	0	a	Because
81886	1	a	And wait wait a few seconds .
81887	0	a	It is not fully real time ,
81888	1	a	so watch it .
81889	0	a	Ach .
81890	0	a	Oh yeah .
81891	0	a	Well
81892	1	a	I am going to paint in the red .
81893	0	a	Ooph .
81894	0	a	Oh .
81895	0	a	That is the background colour .
81896	0	a	Well ,

82031	0	a	Yeah .
82032	0	a	How did it work ?

82034	0	a	And a pen ?
82035	0	a	Well ,
82036	0	a	very good .
82037	1	a	So no red or green .
82038	1	a	And line width .
82039	0	a	I had five .
82040	0	a	Tim had
82041	0	a	Tim , what kind of line width did you have ?
82042	0	a	Okay .
82043	0	a	the big lines were like nine .
82044	0	a	It is a dog .
82045	0	a	I just thought I would pick the easiest one .
82046	0	a	Okay .
82047	0	a	Why a dog ?
82048	0	a	You have a dog at home ?
82049	0	a	Had a dog ?
82050	0	a	Yeah ?
82051	0	a	Well ,
82052	0	a	we had a dog , a few years ago .
82053	0	a	, it is p
82054	0	a	It is pretty good
82055	0	a	An artist .
82056	0	a	And and it ,
82057	0	a	yeah ,
82058	0	a	when it died we did not get a new one or something .
82059	0	a	But
82060	0	a	a Graphical User Designer , so
82061	0	a	Hey .
82062	0	a	You have an artistic inner middle .
82063	0	a	Think you picked the wrong function .
82064	0	a	Wrong job .
82065	0	a	Oh .
82066	0	a	No .
82067	0	a	Can work together .
82068	0	a	colour .
82069	0	a	So I think you can see it is real really a easy programme to use .
82070	0	a	Not difficult at all .
82071	0	a	Wha
82072	0	a	That is enough , thanks .
82073	0	a	Well ,
82074	0	a	it is okay .
82075	0	a	Okay ,
82076	0	a	thank you .
82077	1	a	Janus ?
82078	1	a	The last one ?
82079	0	a	Yeah .
82080	0	a	Yeah , sure .
82081	0	a	Yeah .
82082	0	a	thanks .
82083	0	a	I wonder .
82084	0	a	After a cat , a turtle and a dog .
82085	0	a	I think he is going to draw an elephant .
82086	0	a	I figure I should do something like that ,
82087	1	a	but I am going to do something much more difficult .
82088	0	a	Uh oh .
82089	0	a	Uh oh .
82090	0	a	Oh ,
82091	0	a	he is the artistic design .
82092	1	a	I am going to design a remote remote control animal .
82093	0	a	Remote control animal .
82094	0	a	Exactly .
82095	0	a	Oh .
82096	0	a	Yes .
82097	0	a	Sorry .
82098	0	a	Well
82099	0	a	with the interface , it might be easier to ha to draw here and display there .
82100	0	a	Yeah .
82101	0	a	That that might be easier .
82102	0	a	But at the other hand , a pen like that is easy to hold in your hand ,
82103	0	a	and
82104	0	a	I think it is easier to draw .
82105	0	a	No .
82106	0	a	Better to draw with a with
82107	0	a	But what is he ?
82108	0	a	Is it a rabbit ?
82109	0	a	Do you have a rabbit at home ?
82110	0	a	Is it a white rabbit f
82111	0	a	It is the white rabbit from The Matrix .
82112	0	a	Yeah .
82113	0	a	With a pen than with a mouse mouse .
82114	0	a	Than on the , with
82115	0	a	Yeah ,
82116	0	a	I m I mean like like on here , drawing drawing .
82117	0	a	Mouth .
82118	0	a	Oh , okay .
82119	0	a	And then displaying on screen , but Too expensive , yeah .
82120	0	a	Yeah .
82121	0	a	W with this paper
82122	0	a	it is too mu too expensive .
82123	0	a	No .
82124	0	a	It is a rabbit with broken legs ?
82125	0	a	Yeah .
82126	0	a	A green rabbit .
82127	0	a	No .
82128	0	a	Yeah , exactly .
82129	0	a	Okay , then yeah .
82130	0	a	There , the g white green rabbit .
82131	0	a	So .
82132	0	a	He is a little bit stoned there .
82133	0	a	I figured this is a pretty b good impression of a rabbit .
82134	0	a	It will do .
82135	0	a	well .
82136	0	a	Okay .
82137	1	a	Finishing touch and then we are going further .
82138	0	a	Project Manager ?
82139	0	a	Have you been counting the time ?
82140	0	a	Okay .
82141	0	a	Yeah ?
82142	0	a	Yeah , a little .
82143	1	a	Where does the pen go ?
82144	0	a	Just
82145	0	a	I figured the rabbit was actually the most impressive .
82146	1	a	Let is go on then .
82147	0	a	Well ,
82148	0	a	I think the dog is the the most artistic .
82149	1	a	Do not choose for youself .
82150	0	a	Oh , sorry .
82151	0	a	That is selfish .
82152	0	a	Okay ,
82153	1	a	now we are going to dig into the to the serious stuff .
82154	0	a	It is pretty abstract .
82155	0	a	the selling price for the remote will be twenty five Euro , and the production cost may not be more than twenty and a half Euro .
82156	0	a	So
82157	0	a	from my point of view , I do not think it is going to be very very high tech , high definition , ultra modern kind of remote , for twelve fift twelve and a half Euro .
82158	0	a	the profit we must make with the new remote is fifty million Euro .
82159	0	a	So that is a lot .
82160	0	a	We have to sell a lot of I think w when the selling price is twenty five , you got two million , two million remotes .
82161	0	a	Yeah ,
82162	0	a	how much is it ?
82163	0	a	Hundred million remotes or something ?
82164	0	a	Oh yeah .
82165	0	a	Like how much ?
82166	0	a	Yeah .
82167	0	a	Twenty million .
82168	0	a	Two million , oh
82169	0	a	yeah , two million .
82170	0	a	Yeah .
82171	0	a	But our marketing range is , market range is international .
82172	0	a	So we have virtually the whole world we can sell we can sell our r remotes to .
82173	0	a	At least that countries which have a television .
82174	0	a	So
82175	1	a	now it is time for us to going to discuss a little things .
82176	1	a	You can think about experience with a remote control yourself , at home .
82177	1	a	What you think might be a useful new feature .
82178	1	a	What what can distinguish our new trendy remote control from all the others .
82179	0	a	so
82180	1	a	let is let is discuss a little .
82181	1	a	I am going to join you at the table .
82182	0	a	Well
82183	0	a	what what is the most important thing at a remote control ?
82184	0	a	Okay .
82185	0	a	well
82186	0	a	I think the most important thing of a remote control is that you can switch channels .
82187	1	a	And my opinion is you should keep it as basic as possible .
82188	0	a	Is it possible to open pen drawings in this on this screen ?
82189	0	a	but which
82190	0	a	The ones we made on the
82191	0	a	Oh , only in Word , okay .
82192	0	a	So not a not a remote control who which can can be used for television and a DVD and radio
82193	0	a	and Or just only If you have them on
82194	0	a	I can
82195	0	a	Okay .
82196	0	a	Yeah .
82197	0	a	I think so .
82198	1	a	but I have some points .
82199	0	a	Can I show them on the on the big screen ?
82200	0	a	Maybe ?
82201	1	a	Yeah .
82202	1	a	Yeah , I can find .
82203	0	a	Oh ,
82204	0	a	in case you want it
82205	0	a	This is a dead kind of fly .
82206	0	a	Between the the the , yeah , the the Yeah , be The screens .
82207	0	a	Screen ?
82208	0	a	Okay .
82209	0	a	No no no .
82210	0	a	Only
82211	0	a	All the drawings go there , at the left
82212	0	a	Oh , that pen drawings .
82213	0	a	no , I think when it is in Word and you have saved it in the Shared Documents folder , you can show it there .
82214	0	a	Yeah .
82215	0	a	Okay ,
82216	1	a	I have some points from marketing point of view .
82217	0	a	Yeah .
82218	1	a	just the standard thing li things like intuitive , small , fairly cheap .
82219	0	a	it is pretty cheap , twenty five Euros .
82220	1	a	brand independent .
82221	1	a	I think , it does not have to matter which brand your TV or other thing is .
82222	0	a	Yeah .
82223	0	a	Five minutes ?
82224	0	a	Okay ,
82225	1	a	I will wrap it up quickly .
82226	0	a	Okay .
82227	0	a	Five minutes .
82228	0	a	Yeah .
82229	1	a	I personally think it has to be multi purpose .
82230	0	a	most of the remote c remote controls are just for one purpose .
82231	0	a	Yeah .
82232	0	a	Yeah .
82233	0	a	And by making it multi purpose , it has a new feature , adds a new feature to the market , and distinguish from from current products .
82234	1	a	maybe some other technology than infrared .
82235	0	a	I rather find it very annoying , like when someone is standing in front of the TV then you ca not switch it .
82236	1	a	think about sending it over radio waves or bluetooth .
82237	0	a	Okay .
82238	0	a	Okay .
82239	0	a	That might be a little bit expensive .
82240	1	a	And something like an LCD screen .
82241	0	a	For what purpose ?
82242	0	a	We
82243	1	a	And and the price .
82244	0	a	like I said here Maybe it is easy .
82245	0	a	It is nice as an added feature feature ,
82246	0	a	that , when you are on a certain channel , you can see on the LCD screen what programmes are coming up or
82247	0	a	From my point of view , yeah .
82248	0	a	Okay .
82249	0	a	So it be a multi purpose very technically high remote ?
82250	0	a	Yeah ,
82251	0	a	it must be really innovative , technical wise ?
82252	0	a	Yeah .
82253	0	a	Yeah ,
82254	0	a	it has to be
82255	0	a	Yeah ,
82256	0	a	our company is very good in making new innovative things .
82257	0	a	So yeah ,
82258	0	a	I I agree with you .
82259	0	a	So i i
82260	0	a	i
82261	0	a	i
82262	1	a	To the current market .
82263	1	a	So we must focus on things who are really really add something to to
82264	0	a	Yeah .
82265	0	a	Look ,
82266	0	a	you got some cheap remote controls there .
82267	0	a	They just
82268	0	a	Yeah ,
82269	0	a	you got a dozen of them .
82270	0	a	No .
82271	1	a	But when you enter a new market with a remote control and want to gain market share you have to do something special , I think .
82272	0	a	Yeah .
82273	0	a	Yeah .
82274	0	a	But we have to keep an eye that it is
82275	0	a	at the beginning of such a project , it is it is it is very cool to talk about , well , this would be cool , that would be cool .
82276	0	a	Yeah .
82277	1	a	but we must not lose sight of the the user friendly
82278	0	a	Yeah okay .
82279	0	a	Yeah , of course .
82280	0	a	But it is
82281	0	a	But but this is just from marketing aspect .
82282	0	a	Yeah .
82283	0	a	I do not know anything about user interface or design .
82284	0	a	Okay .
82285	0	a	Okay .
82286	0	a	And that is because we have him .
82287	0	a	And and him .
82288	0	a	And him .
82289	0	a	Okay ,
82290	0	a	next meeting will start in thirty minutes .
82291	0	a	So
82292	0	a	you will have individual actions where I presume will be some feedback , via the m the mail .
82293	0	a	the the the Industrial Designer has to look at the working design .
82294	0	a	the User Interface Designer has to look at the technical functions .
82295	0	a	So
82296	0	a	that is the thing we discussed .
82297	0	a	Yeah .
82298	1	a	one thing ,
82299	1	a	we must first agree on what we are going to m going to make .
82300	0	a	Yeah ?
82301	0	a	Okay .
82302	0	a	Do we
82303	0	a	Are we going to use it it for multiple systems ?
82304	0	a	Or
82305	1	a	We should have some agreement on that before we
82306	0	a	Okay .
82307	0	a	wha
82308	0	a	Yeah .
82309	0	a	I I do not think we have to be , we have to agree on that .
82310	0	a	I think th that is a pha
82311	0	a	Yeah .
82312	1	a	I figure we could get back to it on the next meeting actually .
82313	0	a	That is a phase further .
82314	0	a	Yeah .
82315	0	a	Ju just
82316	1	a	make some mock ups , some some general ideas .
82317	0	a	okay .
82318	1	a	And and then we can plan
82319	0	a	Yeah .
82320	1	a	We can plan further , I think .
82321	0	a	Yeah .
82322	0	a	But maybe , because you are working on the user requirements , you are working on the technical functions ,
82323	1	a	we must have a little or kind of
82324	0	a	How do you call it ?
82325	1	a	a little plan on on what we are going to do .
82326	0	a	Consensus on the , what we are going to do .
82327	0	a	So you do not come up with the user requirements who do not fit the the the the technical functions at all .
82328	1	a	Some basic things we co
82329	1	a	we want to going to do .
82330	0	a	I think that is well
82331	0	a	Yeah .
82332	0	a	Will come in handy .
82333	0	a	yeah .
82334	0	a	I do not know .
82335	0	a	Yeah .
82336	1	a	You decide .
82337	0	a	Okay .
82338	0	a	You are the Project Manager .
82339	0	a	W He says
82340	0	a	Yeah .
82341	1	a	if the technical functions have to be designed , I I have gotta know for what kind of machines they will be .
82342	0	a	Or do we use it a text screen ?
82343	0	a	Or will it be with with bluetooth or
82344	0	a	Okay .
82345	0	a	Well ,
82346	0	a	th that is that is really a step further .
82347	0	a	But if you say is it one way or multi purpose , that is a
82348	0	a	Why ?
82349	0	a	Why ?
82350	0	a	Yeah .
82351	0	a	tha that is a same step further .
82352	0	a	Yeah , actually it is .
82353	0	a	Yeah .
82354	0	a	Then looking at individual components , so that is actually a f step further .
82355	0	a	Yeah .
82356	0	a	Like
82357	1	a	we all have a list of things that has to b that have to be in it , or how it has to be like .
82358	1	a	And then in the next meeting we decide w what it is going to be .
82359	0	a	Yeah .
82360	0	a	Yeah ,
82361	1	a	we can take it from there .
82362	1	a	Yeah , I agree , we can take it from there .
82363	0	a	Okay .
82364	0	a	A
82365	1	a	And then you s then you can delete the o the obsolete details .
82366	1	a	Or edit .
82367	0	a	Okay .
82368	0	a	So
82369	1	a	each individually i individually must think on what is at his point of view is the most important .
82370	0	a	I think .
82371	0	a	Yeah .
82372	1	a	And then we are going to fit all the pieces together the next meeting .
82373	0	a	Yeah .
82374	1	a	I must finish off now ,
82375	0	a	so it is over .
82376	0	a	You will receive specific specific instructions by your personal coach .
82377	0	a	And I see you in thirty minutes .
82378	0	a	Okay ,
82379	0	a	Okay .
82380	0	a	Thank you .
82381	0	a	Sorry .
82382	0	a	Damn .
82383	0	a	Yes .
82384	0	a	Yeah .
82385	0	a	No .
82386	0	a	 
82387	0	a	Hello .
82388	0	a	Hey guys .
82389	0	a	Hi .
82390	0	a	Hi .
82391	0	a	Hi .
82392	0	a	I see my bunny is still standing .
82393	0	a	Yeah .
82394	0	a	No one drawing it .
82395	0	a	It is too beautiful .
82396	0	a	Yeah , true .
82397	0	a	I figured that much .
82398	0	a	Too wicked .
82399	1	a	A minute please ,
82400	0	a	my laptop is
82401	0	a	oh ,
82402	0	a	there it is ,
82403	0	a	thank you .
82404	0	a	So
82405	0	a	welcome back .
82406	0	a	At the functional design meeting
82407	0	a	the plan is that each one of you , so not me but only you will present the the things you worked on the last half hour .
82408	0	a	I will take minutes and will put the minutes that I have at the end of the session in the shared folder .
82409	0	a	Also the minutes of the previous session are also in the shared folder now , so you can read that now or afterwards .
82410	0	a	I had an email from the from the management board
82411	0	a	, I do not know if you a al also received it ,
82412	0	a	but there were four points
82413	0	a	which I think are very important .
82414	0	a	First one is they think that teletext teletext becomes outdated and internet will be the the main focus .
82415	0	a	second one is also important
82416	0	a	, because it is one of the discussion points of the previous session .
82417	0	a	the remote control shou should onl only be used for the television , so it not going to it is not going to be a multi purpose remote control ,
82418	1	a	so that is one thing to keep in mind .
82419	0	a	second , and I think that is important for the Marketing Expert ,
82420	0	a	the current customers are in the age group group of forty years and older , but with this new remote they will would like to reach a group younger than forty .
82421	0	a	and
82422	0	a	I think to keep in mind , but not really for now
82423	0	a	is that they want the the the slogan and the and the logo to to be recognised more in the remote .
82424	0	a	So ,
82425	0	a	we have forty minutes ,
82426	1	a	so I think not more than ten minutes per presentation each , and please use all the the the facilities so that you have either SMARTboards , the the Word files , what you whatever you want .
82427	0	a	So
82428	1	a	Tim , can you start ?
82429	0	a	Yeah ?
82430	0	a	Okay .
82431	0	a	Kay ,
82432	0	a	welcome .
82433	0	a	I have some new findings on Marketing Expert level ,
82434	1	a	which I will show you .
82435	0	a	The method I used was giving orders to our usability lab to do a questionnaire .
82436	0	a	one hundred respondents were involved and my marketing department generated a report with a lot of results .
82437	0	a	, these were a couple of findings , first page of three .
82438	0	a	, we have three audiences of two audiences ,
82439	0	a	I am sorry .
82440	0	a	the first one , this scale , from sixteen to forty five age .
82441	0	a	the second one is from sixty four forty six to sixty five .
82442	0	a	, as you can see here , the market share for the first audience is about sixty percent sixty five .
82443	0	a	second audience audience is thirty five percent .
82444	0	a	and some interests from the from the age groups , it seems like the young users of remote controls really like the fancy new technology stuff , like an LCD screen on the remote control , speech recognition .
82445	0	a	I do not think that is really appropriate .
82446	0	a	, and when you see the audience , the age is going up
82447	0	a	Yeah , they do not really want it anymore , at least the new technologies .
82448	0	a	Second findings out of the questionnaire are the opinion the opinions of the audience about current remote controls .
82449	0	a	First point is , seventy five percent of the users find the most repo remote controls very ugly , and eighty percent of the users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy .
82450	1	a	So that is maybe something for the User Interface Designer .
82451	0	a	Okay ,
82452	0	a	third findings .
82453	0	a	According to the frequency of use versus importance investigation , following buttons are most important .
82454	1	a	, I will tell something about the way this this test was , yeah , done .
82455	0	a	, persons were asked what the buttons were they use most , how much an hour , and in the second table the importance of those buttons .
82456	0	a	, when you multiply them , you get the these three points .
82457	0	a	Switching channels , yeah , that is pretty pretty normal , that is what you do with a remote control .
82458	0	a	the second , teletext , and the third , volume controls .
82459	0	a	, I think it is good that we know what the user want wants ,
82460	1	a	at least the these three points have to be very clear .
82461	0	a	But it is strange that the the manage board the management board said that the teletext will be outdated by the internet .
82462	0	a	Yeah , okay .
82463	0	a	So that that is strange .
82464	0	a	Yeah , okay ,
82465	0	a	but at the moment teletext is
82466	0	a	Yeah , th the best thing you can get on TV , like getting information .
82467	0	a	Yeah , okay .
82468	0	a	So ,
82469	0	a	when you ask people , what do they use , they use teletext and not the internet on a remote control .
82470	0	a	Yeah .
82471	0	a	Okay .
82472	0	a	Yeah , okay .
82473	0	a	That is ridiculous .
82474	0	a	Yeah .
82475	0	a	That is a ne i it
82476	0	a	It is a new technology , but it is not incorporated right now .
82477	0	a	Yeah .
82478	0	a	Okay ,
82479	0	a	my personal preferences .
82480	1	a	I think we should aim at the audience from sixteen to forty five .
82481	0	a	, first of all it is the biggest share , the biggest audience , sixty five percent .
82482	0	a	second , I think you will get the most revenue from i from it .
82483	0	a	, yeah ,
82484	0	a	people from sixteen to forty five watch a lot of TV , more than people who are el elder .
82485	0	a	second point ,
82486	1	a	we have to impro improve the most used functions , as I said here , switching channels , teletext and volume controls .
82487	0	a	Third point that came out of the of the questionnaire , people used to get lost off the remote controller ,
82488	1	a	so maybe it is an idea for us to design ex kind of placeholder on side of the , yeah , of the TV
82489	0	a	where you can put the the remote control in .
82490	0	a	Yeah , that is a cool idea .
82491	0	a	, that is about it , I think .
82492	0	a	Yeah .
82493	0	a	When you mentioned improving functions , what what do you mean by that
82494	1	a	what what are you think about ?
82495	0	a	, the funtionability .
82496	0	a	not not the r not the functions , but it came out that a lot of buttons were not even used on a remote control .
82497	0	a	So you can have a remote control full of buttons , a hundreds hundreds of buttons ,
82498	0	a	but if you do not use them , yeah it is
82499	0	a	Yeah ,
82500	1	a	they have to be on it
82501	0	a	j just to t to get it done if necessary ,
82502	1	a	but the most used buttons have to be bigger or
82503	0	a	Yeah , perhaps .
82504	0	a	Yeah .
82505	0	a	okay ,
82506	0	a	so focusing more on the used buttons .
82507	0	a	Yeah .
82508	0	a	Could you use perhaps one button for multiple functions , like example pressing it in longer makes it switch to an different function for example .
82509	1	a	Just for the minor functions perhaps .
82510	0	a	Thank you .
82511	0	a	Yeah , ma perhaps ,
82512	0	a	just just an idea .
82513	0	a	Just to get less buttons on the remote control , to make it easier and quicker to learn .
82514	0	a	Yeah .
82515	0	a	Yeah ?
82516	0	a	Kay ,
82517	0	a	that is it .
82518	0	a	Thank you , Tim .
82519	0	a	yeah
82520	0	a	yeah , I will go , sure .
82521	1	a	Janus , can you
82522	0	a	Okay ,
82523	0	a	thank you Janus .
82524	0	a	Right ,
82525	1	a	I will be explaining a bit about working design about the project .
82526	0	a	Well
82527	0	a	what I did was I dissected current remote controls
82528	0	a	and I viewed how how they w looked , how they worked , what kind of components are involved , and how they are connected together .
82529	0	a	And after that I put up a scheme about how these things are organised
82530	1	a	and I will show it to you in in a in a few seconds .
82531	1	a	And I will explain a bit about how it works and how we could build one and why I think several possibilities that we discussed in the earlier meeting falls off .
82532	0	a	right .
82533	0	a	well
82534	0	a	what I did was I
82535	0	a	I checked remote controls and the remote controls of today
82536	0	a	are all infrared , not like all probably know .
82537	0	a	And the thing about that is the remote controls have to act as a TV or a stereo or something , and those have a transmitter that is also focused on infrared , so if we want to build a remote control with Bluetooth for instance then the TV should have Bluetooth too in order to communicate , so that would mean extra cost for the user
82538	0	a	and thus that is
82539	0	a	that would not mean a a cheap remote control for us .
82540	0	a	So that is probably why most controls are still infrared .
82541	0	a	Furthermore they all have a a very simple structure , so that would probably mean lower costs
82542	0	a	and
82543	0	a	i
82544	0	a	that could mean for us a good thing
82545	0	a	cause well we we should be able to build a relatively cheap a cheap remote .
82546	0	a	Well
82547	0	a	as I mentioned ready , we have some Bluetooth
82548	0	a	Well
82549	0	a	it may be possible , but I figured it would not be possible in within our budget ,
82550	1	a	but that is not for me to decide ,
82551	1	a	but that is maybe something for marketing to look into .
82552	0	a	F
82553	1	a	because well my personal opinion is is not to do Bluetooth or or radio waves ,
82554	0	a	although
82555	0	a	Yeah ,
82556	0	a	actually I have t
82557	0	a	Yeah .
82558	0	a	What do you think about incorporating Bluetooth or a radio receiver in the place holder next to the TV , connected to the TV ?
82559	0	a	So it is in the wrong product .
82560	0	a	Yeah , I actually I figured that would be that would be rather nice ,
82561	0	a	but then you would still have the the infrared function .
82562	0	a	So in in theory you would actually just move the problem ,
82563	1	a	but what I did think about was when you mentioned about the the cup holder , is why not introduce a speech function like where is the remote .
82564	0	a	Yeah .
82565	0	a	Yeah .
82566	1	a	If somebody says , where is the remote , then it goes beep beep beep beep or something ,
82567	0	a	I dunno , maybe maybe something to look into ,
82568	0	a	I dunno what the cost that something like that would be .
82569	0	a	Yeah .
82570	0	a	But it may be may be something to explore .
82571	1	a	I will I will just explain a bit of the components .
82572	0	a	first you have the energy source .
82573	1	a	The energy source would be a battery , simple battery
82574	0	a	that you can find anywhere .
82575	0	a	I figured that would be best ,
82576	0	a	cause when the battery stops functioning we could just use you could just go out and buy a new one .
82577	1	a	So we did not and we do not have to do all to be too complicated about that .
82578	0	a	the energy source is connected to the infrared button , but the infrared button works only via the chip and the subcomponent to the switch there is a switch between these .
82579	0	a	When the switch is pressed in a w on this
82580	0	a	this case it switches a button , when a button is prush pushed in , a electric current goes through here , and in immediately , a l a bulb lights up displaying to the user that something has happened .
82581	0	a	That is that is so the h user wo not be thinking , well did the button be pressed , w what happened .
82582	0	a	Or I press button but nothing is happening on the TV , so is is something wrong or something .
82583	0	a	So that is just to to to explain the of to to make it clearer to the user .
82584	0	a	w well
82585	0	a	the signal goes via chip that is translated into electric sig electronic signals and then it is processed and then it is sent to the infrared bulb where it will be received on the receiving end .
82586	0	a	And those interpreted by the device , well in this case the television .
82587	0	a	well
82588	0	a	my personal preferences here ,
82589	0	a	well
82590	1	a	we have to keep it simple .
82591	1	a	Not too many gadgets and functions ,
82592	0	a	just like you said
82593	0	a	well
82594	0	a	the most users n
82595	0	a	you have a lot of buttons and you u u use you do not use them ,
82596	1	a	so why why should we invent w spend more time on those .
82597	1	a	I I think we should stick by with infrared transmitting and no receiving .
82598	0	a	So
82599	1	a	no input from the television .
82600	0	a	So
82601	1	a	I think we should not be spending time on teletext and st things like that ,
82602	0	a	because when you want teletext on infrared you would have to build in a receiver too ,
82603	0	a	and so
82604	0	a	in order to receive the signals from what is on TV and such .
82605	0	a	So
82606	0	a	I figure that would be spending too much money and time
82607	0	a	and
82608	0	a	Yes ,
82609	0	a	but what should we s
82610	0	a	I
82611	0	a	I
82612	0	a	I f
82613	0	a	I agree with you ,
82614	0	a	but should we spend money or and time on building a receiver into the remote control ?
82615	0	a	Cause that would be I mean extra components , extra designs , larger g remote control .
82616	0	a	, yeah ,
82617	0	a	maybe another problem ,
82618	0	a	I think current TVs can even send infrared .
82619	0	a	Huh .
82620	0	a	Yeah .
82621	0	a	Yeah .
82622	1	a	These all all stuff that we have to take in account .
82623	1	a	So I I my personal opinion is no no no receiver at all .
82624	0	a	, well
82625	1	a	we should look into the design and the functionability .
82626	0	a	Yeah .
82627	1	a	Like I said , use one button for instance for m multiple functions ,
82628	0	a	or well
82629	1	a	just hide the few buttons o of switching it open or something , the usual stuff .
82630	1	a	And do not overbuild , we should not make a big remote control for simple functions , but we we should stick to the basics .
82631	0	a	So that was my my personal opinion .
82632	0	a	And that was my my presentation
82633	0	a	Yeah ,
82634	0	a	but
82635	0	a	Yeah .
82636	0	a	Okay .
82637	0	a	Yes ,
82638	1	a	I can go ahead .
82639	0	a	You do ?
82640	0	a	The last presentation .
82641	0	a	Last presentation .
82642	0	a	You have plenty of time , Tim and Janus do not talk to ten minutes ,
82643	0	a	so
82644	1	a	take your time .
82645	0	a	Okay .
82646	1	a	If you take your time too long I will eventually warn you .
82647	0	a	Well ,
82648	1	a	I am going to give a presentation abut some of the technical functions of these design and usability functions .
82649	1	a	what is my opinion about what is most important to combine the design , technical possibilities and the user friendliness in one , so if you going to design a remote that looks good , that should not weigh over the if it is possible to make , of course , but also the user friendliness ,
82650	0	a	so tha that is that is some of the main points .
82651	0	a	And another one is the use of many functions will will make it more difficult ,
82652	1	a	so use as as little functions as possible or at least do not display them all at once on the same remote .
82653	0	a	If you have fifty functions you do not want fifty buttons t to be shown at the same time , cause when you visit an internet site you do not want fifty links to see , but maybe use a hierarch hierarchy structure .
82654	1	a	And well one of the ideas was maybe use touch screen ,
82655	0	a	but s I do not know in how far that is possible ,
82656	0	a	since we are sticking to infrared and and the remote cannot receive anything ,
82657	0	a	but we might consider that .
82658	0	a	well ,
82659	0	a	of course I
82660	0	a	I hope this is all clear to you .
82661	0	a	If you
82662	0	a	you can use remote like this with all the functions , many functions ,
82663	0	a	but Well ,
82664	0	a	your thumb is a little bigger than th it than this .
82665	0	a	You have to be very careful what you push , and if you are looking for teletext you will be searching for half an hour
82666	0	a	from
82667	0	a	yeah
82668	0	a	well ,
82669	0	a	where is it ?
82670	0	a	Where the hell
82671	0	a	he here I guess
82672	0	a	and , yeah , when you have to use something else .
82673	1	a	So just keep it simple , make clear buttons , easy to use .
82674	0	a	For example if you want to use a play and back and stop , that is very important .
82675	0	a	well
82676	0	a	this was because of our last discussion ,
82677	1	a	if multiple machines are used , create easy switch between the machines ,
82678	0	a	but it is no longer applying .
82679	0	a	Well yeah ,
82680	1	a	I prefer to use it only for TV
82681	0	a	and n
82682	1	a	not to give too many options and and if possible , the buttons should give a dr direct action , not first select
82683	0	a	Yeah , and so that is where the difficulties lie .
82684	0	a	you you just said you wanted to to combine more functions in one ,
82685	0	a	so
82686	0	a	you you want to keep it simple ,
82687	0	a	but I think that if you want to do that , then you ca not escape the the fact that there will be buttons which give s more options than one .
82688	0	a	Yeah ,
82689	0	a	this
82690	1	a	so that is the thing you have to weigh against each other .
82691	0	a	Yeah ,
82692	0	a	but
82693	0	a	Yeah ,
82694	0	a	but
82695	0	a	Well
82696	0	a	you d you have to keep in mind that several TVs do not even have a menu structure , or they have a very simple menu structure ,
82697	0	a	so
82698	0	a	you have to keep in mind that not all d not
82699	0	a	our remote wo not be able to work on all televisions .
82700	0	a	Do we want to use a few options and might not be so or original , or multi purpose as we thought , or do we want to use many buttons .
82701	0	a	Okay .
82702	0	a	Yeah .
82703	0	a	So
82704	0	a	weighing those factors .
82705	1	a	it is maybe an option if you use an LCD or a touch screen , that in the middle are the the main keys ,
82706	0	a	like displayed on the
82707	0	a	yeah .
82708	0	a	The does not .
82709	0	a	Yeah , this ?
82710	0	a	No ?
82711	0	a	Yeah .
82712	0	a	Something like that .
82713	0	a	Okay ,
82714	1	a	just in the middle the general functions , like play , channel switching , and then at the top or at the bottom , some menus like settings or that you can drop down .
82715	0	a	Yeah .
82716	0	a	Yeah ,
82717	0	a	but when all the questions I had
82718	0	a	Do we want to use a menu display on the TV ?
82719	0	a	Or does have to f everything be in remotes ?
82720	0	a	Cause if you use a memory display on the TV , you can simply push a more menu and then select the options you want to have and press
82721	0	a	okay .
82722	0	a	so
82723	0	a	that is my recommendation ,
82724	1	a	if you use many options in one buttle button , display the menu on the TV and do not use combination of t of two buttons at the same time or pressing buttons three times for five seconds ,
82725	0	a	is too complicated for most users .
82726	0	a	Nah .
82727	0	a	Yeah .
82728	0	a	Yeah .
82729	0	a	I think so too ,
82730	0	a	but
82731	0	a	and that is partly because a lot of TVs have different menus , and when you have a particular menu at your device , it could be that do not correspond to the menu what is actually on TV .
82732	0	a	Yeah , that will be a problem .
82733	0	a	Yeah .
82734	0	a	Yes .
82735	0	a	And that would be a considerable problem .
82736	0	a	So
82737	1	a	if we have to stick with current technologies and well
82738	1	a	yeah , the restrictions of what is is on the market today , you should keep it s at this .
82739	0	a	Yeah .
82740	1	a	Use big clear buttons .
82741	1	a	Not too many .
82742	0	a	So maybe we will loose a few option options ,
82743	0	a	but I think i this is more important .
82744	1	a	especially the important buttons , if you want to switch channel , change your volume , use teletext , it it has to work at once and more advanced options may be put
82745	1	a	it s somewhere away on the remote , behind a little little thing or a touch screen .
82746	0	a	Not embed
82747	0	a	Yeah ,
82748	1	a	but then with something like a touch screen could could make more menu up pop up or something .
82749	0	a	And yeah ,
82750	1	a	if you want to s put on stand by or change the channel , that should always be possible to do .
82751	1	a	Not first change menu options or switch something .
82752	0	a	Yeah .
82753	0	a	, well yeah ,
82754	1	a	as you already told , give some feedback .
82755	0	a	Yeah .
82756	1	a	If the user is pushing a button he should know if the television or n at least remote is reacting and not just that the batteries may be low .
82757	0	a	And , well ,
82758	0	a	my conclusion is is less is more ,
82759	1	a	keep it simple .
82760	0	a	So
82761	1	a	maybe we should just ease down on the functionality to to keep it accessible
82762	0	a	on t
82763	0	a	because you all know , if there are a lot of function on the the television , some you you will never know and never use ,
82764	0	a	and therefore it is important
82765	1	a	if you want to change the volume or channel that is always accessible and easy and other functions that are not so important
82766	1	a	well you we should consider just not using them or at least putting them somewhere on the remote where they are not in the way for the for the most important functions .
82767	0	a	Yeah .
82768	0	a	Yeah .
82769	0	a	I think the idea about touch screen is very good .
82770	0	a	, because recently I saw news item on TV about new telephones for elder people .
82771	0	a	, they have like a touch screen with really big pictures on it like call hang up ,
82772	0	a	and that is a big ad advantage I think ,
82773	1	a	because one the one hand you make the remote control compatible for elder users just by scaling up the pictures or something .
82774	0	a	It is very visual intended .
82775	1	a	What was I to say more ?
82776	0	a	Yeah .
82777	0	a	Maybe that is an option .
82778	1	a	keep the primary buttons visible .
82779	1	a	make a remote that fits easily in the hands and for some design issues well , put a logo on it and maybe use it in some aesthetic aesthetic form .
82780	1	a	But th the important buttons m make them always accessible and pushable and clear and maybe use a touch screen , or if that is will become too difficult just like televi some o older telephones use a l
82781	1	a	maybe it is possible to to flip them open and just expand the number of options that are normally visible .
82782	0	a	Yeah okay ,
82783	0	a	but but if you pick the the idea , the left idea
82784	0	a	then what is going to be displayed on the touch screen ?
82785	0	a	Yeah ,
82786	0	a	but l like menu functions or
82787	0	a	okay .
82788	0	a	Yeah .
82789	0	a	The extra functions .
82790	0	a	The extra functions , you you just see a menu from system functions or teletext functions , and you just choose one , and then all all the options will become available and
82791	0	a	you
82792	0	a	just c
82793	0	a	s
82794	0	a	yeah
82795	0	a	t scroll through them .
82796	0	a	Yeah .
82797	0	a	Would not it be better to make just one big touch screen , one one small touch screen applet
82798	1	a	and I will just make let is say fifteen buttons on it , and we have three of those , actually just menus with sub menus , with or sub items , sub functions .
82799	0	a	Yeah , I think so .
82800	0	a	Yeah .
82801	0	a	Well
82802	1	a	then I would like to make a proposal .
82803	1	a	If you make one big touch screen , use the same concept as here , keep the buttons always available and use the lower part of the touch screen for the rest .
82804	0	a	Yes .
82805	0	a	Yeah .
82806	0	a	Yeah .
82807	0	a	Yeah , yeah ,
82808	0	a	like like the iPod idea that that we just saw .
82809	0	a	Yeah .
82810	0	a	Yeah .
82811	0	a	You just have a f a few selected buttons and a few menus , and with this idea you could actually make several you can also improve later on .
82812	0	a	Yes .
82813	0	a	I think that will be great .
82814	0	a	Okay .
82815	0	a	So you think it is will be better to have a t kind of total touch screen .
82816	0	a	Yeah , I think so .
82817	0	a	Yeah , I wou I would actually go for the Yeah .
82818	0	a	Jirun ?
82819	0	a	Yeah .
82820	0	a	Okay , I agree , but I think it is very important
82821	1	a	that they always make the same buttons accessible , so use just for special options a part of the touch screen .
82822	0	a	Yeah , of course .
82823	0	a	And so an elder designer picks up th the of
82824	0	a	an elder parents or grandparent picks up the remote from the little child and who is all in the systems functions , you will have to have the possibility to turn off the TV or to switch the channel without well using all the menu structures to get back to the primary functions .
82825	0	a	Yeah
82826	0	a	yeah
82827	0	a	yeah .
82828	0	a	Yeah .
82829	0	a	Yeah ,
82830	1	a	I had another idea about maybe parental control .
82831	1	a	like building in some kind of PIN code which allows parents to switch to all channels ,
82832	0	a	but children
82833	1	a	if children do not do not know the PIN code , they ca not switch to violent channels or
82834	0	a	Th there is just
82835	1	a	Ju just a simple log in , something like that .
82836	0	a	Yeah .
82837	0	a	Yeah
82838	0	a	wh
82839	0	a	Is that possible to use or no ?
82840	0	a	Well ,
82841	0	a	yeah
82842	0	a	well ,
82843	0	a	does it have to depend on the television ?
82844	0	a	Well ,
82845	1	a	I think that he means that maybe by some option make sure that remote control and the TV match , and then after that you can use some s insert some passwords as being apparent that the children cannot use this change the settings of the TV , like colour and then volume
82846	0	a	and
82847	0	a	That is possible ,
82848	0	a	that well
82849	0	a	that actually depends on the television ,
82850	0	a	but I think I figure that would be
82851	0	a	Well ,
82852	0	a	y
82853	0	a	you s
82854	0	a	you see the fi
82855	0	a	thing is when you buy a remote , you you set the channels , the the channels are different on each te television , they are not set in a preset order ,
82856	0	a	so
82857	0	a	if you lock on a remote , let is say channel fifteen , well channel fifteen on this television is different than channel fifteen on the other television ,
82858	0	a	so that would be that would be actually the main concern .
82859	0	a	Yeah .
82860	0	a	Yeah .
82861	0	a	Yeah .
82862	0	a	Yeah , okay .
82863	0	a	Yeah .
82864	0	a	Yeah .
82865	0	a	Yeah .
82866	0	a	Yeah , th that kind of stuff ,
82867	1	a	but maybe if you log in first as a parent , you address the the channels
82868	0	a	and like oh , that is channel fifteen , that is vi violent channel ,
82869	0	a	m my ki my kids
82870	0	a	I do not want my kids to watch that ,
82871	1	a	then you set the priority to only parents ,
82872	0	a	for example .
82873	0	a	Yes .
82874	0	a	Oh , something like that .
82875	0	a	Yes .
82876	0	a	Yeah .
82877	0	a	Yeah .
82878	0	a	Okay , yeah .
82879	0	a	Well
82880	1	a	b but make it a separate option in the menu ,
82881	0	a	so that it is it is dif dis
82882	0	a	displayed from displayed here ,
82883	0	a	so
82884	0	a	parents
82885	0	a	Yeah ,
82886	0	a	you can de display it on the on the old style .
82887	0	a	Yeah ,
82888	0	a	that would b
82889	0	a	Yeah , that .
82890	0	a	But
82891	0	a	Yeah okay ,
82892	0	a	but but yeah , that is just
82893	0	a	that is an a an added feature .
82894	0	a	Yeah .
82895	0	a	Okay .
82896	1	a	But let is not go too wide about the those things ,
82897	0	a	that is that why we are here .
82898	0	a	Yeah ,
82899	0	a	th th those things are nice .
82900	0	a	It is it is a nice idea ,
82901	1	a	but I think that is we wel later in the stage .
82902	1	a	I have one little question about a total touch screen
82903	0	a	or a p
82904	0	a	yeah , a partial ,
82905	0	a	because I think elderly people may be not used to a touch screen , so they want the the the normal functions like teletext , volume changing , to be , yeah , kind of traditionals and the the the the other functions , the more difficult functions to be maybe on the touch screen , but to keep this as normal as possible , to keep it accessible .
82906	0	a	Partial .
82907	0	a	Yeah .
82908	0	a	Yeah ,
82909	1	a	but but if you display it on LCD screen with r r really big numbers
82910	0	a	that is just as e just as easy .
82911	0	a	I I do
82912	0	a	I do agree ,
82913	0	a	because well , it is just not the same when you touch a touch screen or when you touch a button ,
82914	1	a	but well we have to look at what is our target audience .
82915	1	a	You can display actual buttons on the touch screens .
82916	0	a	Yeah .
82917	0	a	Yeah , that is true , that is true .
82918	0	a	Yeah .
82919	0	a	Yeah , okay .
82920	0	a	Yeah , it is different .
82921	0	a	W we are aiming for younger people
82922	0	a	and they they chose
82923	0	a	So that is that is probably a
82924	0	a	But they
82925	0	a	Well
82926	0	a	they they all have to be programmed to fit your TV
82927	0	a	and that that is bit of a tricky job .
82928	0	a	Yeah .
82929	0	a	Yeah , that is true , yeah .
82930	0	a	Yeah ,
82931	0	a	age b below forty .
82932	0	a	Yeah ,
82933	0	a	yeah
82934	0	a	yeah ,
82935	0	a	yeah , that is a good point .
82936	0	a	Yep .
82937	0	a	And th those young people , yeah .
82938	0	a	Y you saw it in my marketing report , they like the new fancy stuff ,
82939	0	a	so
82940	0	a	A touch screen , like Microsoft al already developed something like that for multi media applications .
82941	0	a	They like the fancy stuff , yeah .
82942	0	a	That is true .
82943	0	a	Yeah .
82944	1	a	I th
82945	1	a	I think we can do that too .
82946	0	a	Okay ,
82947	0	a	as you can see the minutes from the second meeting , this one , are are done .
82948	0	a	Done .
82949	0	a	I have added the this four things from the management board just to keep in mind .
82950	0	a	each time I I had a sort of summary on what you told and what you personal think .
82951	0	a	so that can be can be read out .
82952	0	a	a f a few things
82953	0	a	I I noticed were
82954	1	a	Moment .
82955	0	a	Ooh .
82956	0	a	th the the main points in this in this meeting is I think how it is going to look
82957	0	a	with
82958	0	a	we must keep it simple , but have the opportunity to have more options and have them hidden or something , so they do not you do not have a big thing full of buttons
82959	0	a	or and
82960	0	a	the point that you want to use one controller for hypothetically each television ,
82961	0	a	so you must the the the
82962	0	a	the functions , know , like the menus or the the parental control must be all by the done by the remote control and not by the television .
82963	0	a	I think that is the point what we discussed .
82964	0	a	Yes .
82965	0	a	Yeah ,
82966	0	a	yeah ,
82967	0	a	some of them .
82968	0	a	The menus are not identical for all th for all TVs ,
82969	1	a	so you have to display it on one TV .
82970	0	a	Well
82971	1	a	you can use when you how do you call it , s synchronized , the remote and the TV ,
82972	0	a	then there is always , there are always possibilities to change the colour and the brightness and the volume
82973	1	a	and well maybe we can look out if there is options that the remote in its memory can see what kind of TV it is ,
82974	0	a	from
82975	1	a	, it is a Philips , this and this and that , and then give the options that are capable
82976	0	a	the capable from the t
82977	0	a	Well
82978	0	a	there are universal d remotes and they all have a functionality for all the TVs , so this would not be a extra feature to incorporate the men menus of these .
82979	0	a	Yeah ,
82980	0	a	but that is not possible .
82981	0	a	, yeah .
82982	0	a	Yeah ,
82983	0	a	but you have an
82984	0	a	yeah ,
82985	0	a	but you have an international market range , so you have I think a big range of
82986	0	a	Yeah .
82987	0	a	Add th that that is an opportunity .
82988	0	a	Yeah .
82989	0	a	Okay .
82990	0	a	But
82991	0	a	No .
82992	0	a	And it is not too complex to do it .
82993	0	a	Yeah .
82994	0	a	Yeah .
82995	0	a	I actually use one of those
82996	0	a	when
82997	0	a	They are they are kind of kind of troublesome ,
82998	0	a	but but the thing is whe when you start building something like this you have to build a receiver into the t into the remotes , because in order for the remote to process something from the TV , like to synchronise and you have to send and receive ,
82999	0	a	and that is well
83000	0	a	Yeah .
83001	0	a	Yeah .
83002	0	a	Well
83003	0	a	Yeah .
83004	0	a	Oh mo
83005	0	a	no ,
83006	0	a	you can just say the c
83007	0	a	Yeah .
83008	0	a	No no no .
83009	0	a	Just build it in .
83010	0	a	He he he
83011	0	a	he me
83012	0	a	he means just just one other thing .
83013	0	a	, with the current remote controls , the universal ones , you have to press
83014	0	a	yeah , you have to press a code for TV .
83015	0	a	Yes .
83016	0	a	In codes , y you you get a b a book with codes .
83017	0	a	You look up , I have a Philips H fifty five
83018	0	a	and it says press code four five five
83019	0	a	and you press code four five five on the in the remote
83020	0	a	and it displays all your menu options .
83021	0	a	Yeah .
83022	0	a	Yeah .
83023	0	a	Oh , okay ,
83024	0	a	yeah , sure ,
83025	0	a	Yeah
83026	0	a	yeah
83027	0	a	yeah .
83028	0	a	Oh ,
83029	0	a	yeah
83030	0	a	yeah ,
83031	0	a	sure , that would be possible , yeah .
83032	0	a	Yeah .
83033	1	a	Now we just connect the TV type to a set of options , in just just in the memory ,
83034	0	a	so that if you
83035	0	a	yeah , like profile ,
83036	0	a	so that if you touch in like one four one zero kind of TV the memory pops up the options .
83037	0	a	Memory in the in the remote .
83038	0	a	Yep .
83039	0	a	Profiles .
83040	0	a	Yeah .
83041	0	a	Yeah .
83042	0	a	Yeah , that would be possible .
83043	0	a	Okay .
83044	0	a	Yeah , sure .
83045	0	a	I th do not think that is that takes a lot of storage space or some just varia variables .
83046	0	a	No , that would not be
83047	0	a	Yeah , a few variables .
83048	0	a	Yeah , well
83049	0	a	if you look at the manuals from universal remotes , there are maybe three four hundreds TVs at maximum .
83050	0	a	Yeah .
83051	0	a	Yeah .
83052	0	a	If you have all of them , all the old and new TVs summed up ,
83053	0	a	so
83054	0	a	I think it is possible .
83055	0	a	it is .
83056	0	a	It is definitely po
83057	0	a	Yeah , firmware upgrade .
83058	0	a	But , on the other hand on the other hand , if you have a remote and buy a new TV that is not incorporated in the remote
83059	0	a	New remote ?
83060	0	a	A firmware upgrade or something ,
83061	1	a	but from where ?
83062	0	a	We have five minutes to go .
83063	0	a	Yeah .
83064	0	a	Well then you have to buy a new one ,
83065	0	a	it is very good for marketing
83066	0	a	Maybe , or an update , software update .
83067	0	a	Firmware update , you say .
83068	0	a	Maybe w
83069	0	a	No m may no ,
83070	1	a	maybe we can incorporate some kind of USB or a firewire connection , so that you can connect it to the PC and download the newest firmware from from the internet .
83071	1	a	That is maybe the cup holder .
83072	0	a	Yeah .
83073	0	a	Well ,
83074	0	a	not everybody has has a PC at home .
83075	0	a	Well
83076	0	a	the most most people have , but not not everybody
83077	0	a	and
83078	0	a	Yeah .
83079	0	a	Well ,
83080	0	a	at
83081	1	a	you can go back to the shop
83082	0	a	and they
83083	0	a	Yeah ,
83084	0	a	ser o
83085	1	a	and they can download it for you .
83086	0	a	Yeah ,
83087	0	a	like a s kind of service centre .
83088	0	a	Yeah , maybe something like service cen
83089	1	a	Or you could well you could s actually look at the place holder you talked about earlier , and you could probably make a connection to an telephone line or a internet connection .
83090	0	a	Yeah .
83091	0	a	Yeah .
83092	0	a	Well
83093	0	a	already digital information is sent t to the the standards , TV connections , you can see what is programme is on on the new channels ,
83094	1	a	so maybe j they we can send that information along with standard TV
83095	0	a	Receiving .
83096	0	a	Yeah .
83097	0	a	Well
83098	0	a	then then it is be back to the building a receiving well if it is actually worth it to build it in ,
83099	1	a	we could actually look at into it ,
83100	0	a	but I dunno ,
83101	0	a	it it would be bringing more costs with with it
83102	0	a	and
83103	0	a	Yeah , that would be probably best , yeah .
83104	0	a	Oh yeah .
83105	0	a	Yeah .
83106	0	a	Yeah .
83107	0	a	Difficult .
83108	0	a	Yeah .
83109	0	a	I I think it is most cheap or cheapest to just do the updates at the service centre or at the shop .
83110	0	a	Yeah
83111	0	a	yeah ,
83112	0	a	s
83113	0	a	I think
83114	0	a	some
83115	0	a	I think it is good idea ,
83116	0	a	yeah .
83117	0	a	Yeah .
83118	0	a	Like when you when you buy a TV you just ask well I will
83119	0	a	Yeah .
83120	0	a	It is it is it is not a lot of work , just one docking station where you put it in , press start , bling bling , updated .
83121	0	a	Yeah , that would be best , yeah .
83122	0	a	Yeah .
83123	0	a	Yeah .
83124	0	a	Yeah .
83125	0	a	You do not buy a TV every week , new teev so .
83126	0	a	Okay ,
83127	1	a	let is save this in the meanwhile
83128	0	a	m for which one are we going ?
83129	0	a	My mistake .
83130	0	a	No no .
83131	0	a	Exactly , so
83132	0	a	Yeah ,
83133	0	a	my vote goes out to the right .
83134	1	a	Let is vote .
83135	0	a	That one or
83136	0	a	Your vote and your
83137	0	a	Okay .
83138	0	a	My vote too .
83139	0	a	Yeah .
83140	0	a	And your vote ?
83141	0	a	Yeah .
83142	0	a	Well ,
83143	0	a	I was doubting about which one to take ,
83144	0	a	but you have convinced me that if you di display buttons about the same as they would look on a normal remote all elderly people will know what to do .
83145	0	a	Yeah .
83146	1	a	And also like a clapping li like device that pops open .
83147	0	a	Opens up
83148	0	a	is too difficult
83149	0	a	or
83150	0	a	Break it , I do not get
83151	0	a	Oh
83152	0	a	so
83153	0	a	Yeah .
83154	0	a	Flips open .
83155	0	a	too difficult ,
83156	1	a	maybe it is easier to break it .
83157	0	a	N
83158	0	a	yeah .
83159	0	a	Yeah ,
83160	0	a	th th th
83161	0	a	that i
83162	0	a	Yeah .
83163	0	a	It is very sensitive .
83164	0	a	Like my telephone , it is it is sensitive too .
83165	0	a	Yeah .
83166	0	a	Yeah .
83167	0	a	Okay well
83168	0	a	it is almost at the end .
83169	0	a	So we have now a lunch break , finally ,
83170	0	a	yeah .
83171	0	a	after the lunch break it is back to individual work , once again thirty minutes .
83172	1	a	I will put my minutes
83173	0	a	I have updated them so s they are updated in the shared folder too .
83174	0	a	Thirty minutes ?
83175	0	a	How minutes ?
83176	1	a	One question ,
83177	0	a	how late do we have to get back be back here ?
83178	0	a	Thirty minutes lunch break ?
83179	0	a	I thought forty five .
83180	0	a	Thirty minutes ,
83181	0	a	the
83182	0	a	Failure .
83183	0	a	the specifi specific instructions for the next meeting you will all will receive at the the the email .
83184	1	a	I do not think I can say much about it ,
83185	1	a	so wait for your email
83186	0	a	and hopefully you get it done in the in the thirty minutes ,
83187	1	a	and I w will see you after the lunch break and the thirty minutes .
83188	0	a	Yeah ?
83189	0	a	well
83190	0	a	thirty minutes .
83191	0	a	A quarter to one maybe ?
83192	0	a	Okay .
83193	0	a	, yeah .
83194	0	a	Thirty minutes lunch break , yeah .
83195	0	a	Oh .
83196	0	a	Forty five ?
83197	1	a	then would it be one o'clock .
83198	0	a	Yeah .
83199	0	a	Yeah .
83200	1	a	Or we we ask our personal coach .
83201	0	a	Okay .
83202	0	a	Yeah .
83203	0	a	Okay .
83204	0	a	Thank you .
83205	0	a	Thank you , that was a very good session I think ,
83206	0	a	we we
83207	0	a	well
83208	0	a	Yeah , because all things are stored in smart board dot XDK
83209	0	a	and that is in
83210	0	a	No .
83211	0	a	Yeah ,
83212	0	a	is it possible to store this on the share documents or what
83213	0	a	Kay ,
83214	1	a	save it as an image
83215	0	a	on the res
83216	1	a	No , and use an image if possible .
83217	0	a	Yeah , me too .
83218	1	a	Save as .
83219	0	a	Yeah ,
83220	0	a	v
83221	0	a	But but you can open a from your pr from your laptop .
83222	0	a	Yeah , maybe .
83223	0	a	Save as .
83224	1	a	Export .
83225	0	a	No .
83226	1	a	Maybe not export function .
83227	0	a	Export .
83228	0	a	Well
83229	0	a	I can I can
83230	1	a	You all have the the questionnaire again about the after work .
83231	0	a	Export HTML .
83232	0	a	Huh , image ?
83233	0	a	Paper size A four .
83234	0	a	J PEG .
83235	0	a	G
83236	0	a	yeah , J PEG .
83237	0	a	J PEG .
83238	0	a	Yeah , it is better
83239	0	a	Yeah .
83240	0	a	screen size .
83241	0	a	In this directory .
83242	0	a	N
83243	0	a	oh .
83244	0	a	Oh yeah ,
83245	0	a	it is not connected to the to our PCs .
83246	0	a	No ?
83247	0	a	Yeah , it is connected .
83248	0	a	It is connected ?
83249	0	a	Yeah .
83250	0	a	Yeah , I think so .
83251	0	a	To room .
83252	0	a	Deskt Huh .
83253	0	a	No .
83254	0	a	I will just saved in my documents .
83255	0	a	Oh .
83256	0	a	Yeah
83257	1	a	in my own in my own messenger .
83258	1	a	Project documents , yeah .
83259	0	a	Yeah .
83260	0	a	It gives the na Oh .
83261	0	a	Yes .
83262	0	a	Okay , nice .
83263	0	a	Okay ,

83266	0	a	Okay .
83267	0	a	well ,
83268	0	a	it is it is simply filling
83269	0	a	oh no ,
83270	0	a	it is it is also filling out
83271	0	a	no ,
83272	1	a	I would do it after lunch I think .
83273	0	a	I am hungry ,
83274	1	a	so do it after lunch .

83277	0	a	Thank you .
83278	0	a	You are welcome .
83279	1	a	We can leave the PC on I think ,
83280	0	a	yeah
83281	0	a	and return to the
83282	0	a	Yeah ,
83283	0	a	bring to
83284	0	a	I gotta bring it home .
83285	0	a	Yeah , of course .
83286	0	a	Yeah .
83287	0	a	Well
83288	1	a	I bring it to my personal room .
83289	0	a	To my exave executive
83290	0	a	Aye .
83291	0	a	A big office .
83292	0	a	Yeah .
83293	0	a	 
83294	0	a	Hello again .
83295	0	a	Hi .
83296	0	a	Hello .
83297	0	a	Hey , Project Manager .
83298	1	a	, Project Manager , I have something to tell you .
83299	0	a	yeah .
83300	0	a	I have a little problems with my laptop .
83301	0	a	Okay .
83302	0	a	And s s s
83303	0	a	so I had a little less time to complete .
83304	0	a	Okay .
83305	0	a	No , a little problem , big problem .
83306	0	a	I just thought
83307	0	a	, it did not work anymore .
83308	0	a	What was it , problem ?
83309	0	a	The laptop ?
83310	0	a	It hang hung .
83311	0	a	The entire Windows
83312	0	a	It it hung .
83313	0	a	Ha ha .
83314	0	a	Oh .
83315	0	a	Project Manager .
83316	0	a	Yes .
83317	0	a	You are our Project Manager .
83318	0	a	Yes .
83319	0	a	Your project manager .
83320	0	a	Welcome to the conceptual design meeting for Real Reaction .
83321	0	a	, hello again .
83322	0	a	it is the same as the last time .
83323	0	a	, also this time there will be three presentations .
83324	1	a	And we must reach a decision on the remote control concepts .
83325	1	a	, and at the end , I , when I finish it off I have some input from a master class I visited .
83326	1	a	information .
83327	0	a	During lunch , yeah .
83328	0	a	Master .
83329	0	a	He is the master , yeah .
83330	0	a	Master of I am sorry .
83331	0	a	The the the the the concepts on we where we must reach a decision on .
83332	0	a	, our from are of two sorts .
83333	0	a	Components concepts and user interface concepts .
83334	0	a	, the first one is really about the the the the the total package with
83335	0	a	Well , we have decided to do a do the with a touch screen that must be a case around it so it wo not be as breakable .
83336	0	a	how how about the energy ?
83337	0	a	Can you can you reload it or just have batteries which you must exchange ? , the user interface concept .
83338	0	a	, with the type and the the supplements .
83339	0	a	So where to put what button .
83340	1	a	And I would say Jans , can you begin ?
83341	0	a	Okay .
83342	1	a	Yeah , sure .
83343	0	a	At the end ,
83344	1	a	I will take notes
83345	0	a	and at the end of the minutes will be at the shared folder .
83346	0	a	Okay .
83347	0	a	, let me see .
83348	0	a	I think it is this one .
83349	0	a	Ha .
83350	0	a	Wow .
83351	0	a	Right .
83352	0	a	, well ,
83353	1	a	I will be talking about the components .
83354	0	a	, what I did was I reviewed previously used items by two two different age groups .
83355	0	a	below forty five and above .
83356	0	a	And I just watch what the differences are and I checked , well , what what d do we want , and how can we d aim a at the target group .
83357	0	a	Well what I found was that a senior
83358	0	a	senior citizens
83359	0	a	, it is it is okay .
83360	1	a	Okay .
83361	1	a	Go on .
83362	0	a	They , well , they like more the they like the traditional materials , like wood and and such more .
83363	0	a	Wood and chrome .
83364	0	a	And they like straightforward shapes .
83365	0	a	, they they they they like luxurious styles , where whereas the young and dynamic , they like a more soft materials .
83366	0	a	Think of the Teletubbies , for instance .
83367	0	a	, soft and fluffy and colourful and Well , shapes are curved and round .
83368	0	a	Y y
83369	0	a	you get the picture .
83370	0	a	And they like sports and gaming , and that gives them the vitality .
83371	0	a	, so w well , firs
83372	0	a	Yes .
83373	1	a	One one little question .
83374	0	a	about the the material .
83375	0	a	Yeah .
83376	0	a	a soft material for a remote control ?
83377	0	a	Okay .
83378	1	a	No , I will I will get to that .
83379	0	a	You you will see .
83380	0	a	Yeah .
83381	0	a	Yeah .
83382	0	a	Thank you .
83383	0	a	, well f first off , let is start start with the energy .
83384	0	a	W
83385	0	a	I
83386	0	a	I had a choice between a few different sources .
83387	0	a	But the two basic sources that I found were the best possible were the battery versus kinetic .
83388	0	a	kinetic
83389	0	a	, that is when you move something , then it gets energy .
83390	0	a	I figured , well that is ki kind of high tech , when when you have a remote control that well , when you pick it up , it has power .
83391	0	a	That would be actually very nice , I figured .
83392	0	a	Oh .
83393	0	a	Well , we could also use a battery ,
83394	0	a	that is a bit
83395	0	a	Yeah .
83396	0	a	Yeah but when the power gets low , you have to shake it or something ?
83397	0	a	, and
83398	0	a	Yeah
83399	0	a	yeah ,
83400	0	a	you c
83401	0	a	just you have to shake it around a little bit .
83402	0	a	And then then it d then it has some more energy .
83403	0	a	Well , y you could just go for a battery .
83404	0	a	Or you can go for both ?
83405	0	a	Yeah , I actually did .
83406	0	a	Oh , have you considered the option of using a solar panel ?
83407	0	a	W nah .
83408	0	a	But the thing is about solar panel is you have to have l light .
83409	0	a	Well , sunlight preferably .
83410	0	a	, and you you could you could use normal light , but you would not get the same amount of energy that you would from a battery or something .
83411	0	a	Yeah .
83412	0	a	for ultimate b n use of solar panels , you could actually use
83413	0	a	you could use solar panels , but you ha you would have to implement them into the remote control , leaving you a bit less space for the interface .
83414	0	a	yeah .
83415	0	a	Yeah .
83416	0	a	It is too less space .
83417	0	a	So so i i it it wo what is actually
83418	0	a	I
83419	0	a	I c just in f
83420	0	a	I have figured it out that well , seeing that you will always be within the l distance of TV , and the from TV there comes a a a whole bunch of light .
83421	0	a	So it would actually power itself from a TV .
83422	0	a	Yeah .
83423	0	a	But , well you just take up all the space , and you would not have the full amount of power actually used .
83424	0	a	Okay .
83425	0	a	But you prefer kinetic ?
83426	0	a	Okay .
83427	0	a	So
83428	0	a	I I prefer kinetic because it is well , the costs are not that much higher , and , ju just a bit more high tech than than a normal battery .
83429	0	a	I mean , if
83430	0	a	No , but d Well , you pick it up and you press buttons and y
83431	0	a	well , you
83432	0	a	Yeah , well actually it is .
83433	0	a	Yeah , but you do not move a a remote control too much .
83434	0	a	And that is enough to to keep the energy level
83435	0	a	Okay .
83436	0	a	And it it
83437	0	a	if it is not , you just shake it a bit and and add add with power up again .
83438	0	a	Yeah .
83439	0	a	But , what l what Jarek said , you could you could use a battery that you would just keep it on the recharging whenever it moves .
83440	0	a	And for rest , you would just add juice on the battery .
83441	0	a	Okay .
83442	0	a	And when the battery does not work , I usually shake it too .
83443	0	a	So Like slamming on it .
83444	0	a	Exactly .
83445	0	a	It is exactly the same .
83446	0	a	And so that well ,
83447	0	a	f furthermore , you you we checked the cases .
83448	0	a	Thank you , Tim .
83449	0	a	We have different options concerning the cases .
83450	0	a	You ha
83451	0	a	I
83452	0	a	you sim you simply add a basic standard model
83453	0	a	it was kind of square
83454	0	a	and I figured that is a bit boring .
83455	0	a	So you you
83456	0	a	we could go for the single curved or the double curved .
83457	0	a	, single curve , it is just a well , , you know , it is just a nice curve .
83458	0	a	Or but but you could go in a in an double curves .
83459	0	a	And that is like several different dimensions .
83460	0	a	That gives you an whole new effec
83461	0	a	Yeah , that gives you a younger and more high tech look , I f I figured .
83462	0	a	Yeah .
83463	0	a	Dynamic dynamic look ?
83464	0	a	A little artistic .
83465	1	a	But , that we will discuss later .
83466	1	a	But , are you going to draw it ?
83467	0	a	The
83468	0	a	Yeah .
83469	0	a	What ?
83470	0	a	You want me to draw in three D ?
83471	1	a	, yeah , I ca I ca
83472	1	a	I could I could show you .
83473	0	a	Th th
83474	0	a	yeah .
83475	0	a	Yeah .
83476	0	a	Yeah .
83477	0	a	, I c I ca not imagine .
83478	0	a	I ca not imagine how how how it looks like .
83479	1	a	I could show you .
83480	0	a	Well let is say y you
83481	0	a	Let is say that is your standard That is a bit your d standard design .
83482	0	a	Yeah .
83483	0	a	Design .
83484	0	a	Yeah .
83485	0	a	But you could actually go like something like this .
83486	0	a	And then in three D effect you could go
83487	0	a	So y you you just
83488	0	a	Yeah , this is a this bit difficulty in I did not take a major in art .
83489	0	a	Yeah .
83490	0	a	Oh , okay .
83491	0	a	So But
83492	0	a	but you could have a whole new the back back the the the depth , you could you could just play around a bit with .
83493	0	a	Okay .
83494	0	a	You you do not have to use standard
83495	0	a	Yeah you could y
83496	0	a	It leaves more space for creativity .
83497	0	a	Oh , okay .
83498	0	a	Okay .
83499	0	a	Okay .
83500	0	a	that might be an idea ,
83501	0	a	but just a
83502	0	a	Well , furthermore , well , plastic versus rubber ?
83503	0	a	You We could choose what what is better , plastic or rubber .
83504	0	a	I I ch prefer rubber because it feels Yeah .
83505	0	a	It is soft .
83506	0	a	Yeah , it is soft and it is that I like soft .
83507	0	a	That is the material the younger people want , ai not it ?
83508	0	a	Just like the watch from Seiko .
83509	0	a	Yeah ,
83510	0	a	yeah
83511	0	a	I mean plastic is
83512	0	a	Plastic also has that cheap feeling to it ,
83513	0	a	like plastic
83514	0	a	Your your
83515	0	a	I usually associate plastic with something that is cheap .
83516	0	a	that is maybe just me ,
83517	1	a	but , we could , oh , talk about it later .
83518	0	a	furthermore , buttons .
83519	0	a	traditional or a touch screen .
83520	0	a	Well , we discussed it in a previous meeting , so I figured I will just leave it at the LCD .
83521	0	a	And chip set , well if we are going to use traditional buttons , we could go with a simple chip set .
83522	0	a	But if we decide to go on a n LCD screen , we would use an we have to use an a advanced chip set .
83523	0	a	And that would bring the necessary costs with with it .
83524	0	a	So that is something we th have to keep in mind .
83525	0	a	If it is not manageable budget wise , we would have to go over to to sim to simple buttons .
83526	0	a	Well , I think we are going to sell tell ten millions of them .
83527	0	a	So I bet a big company in Korea or Taiwan , like Samsung , can give us a big discount on the chips , so
83528	0	a	U usually , chips are are not more expensive than one dollar .
83529	0	a	Yeah .
83530	0	a	Yeah , probably .
83531	0	a	Yeah , probably ,
83532	0	a	but But yeah , that is that is
83533	0	a	That should not should not be that big a issue .
83534	0	a	So
83535	0	a	That that should not be a real issue , I think .
83536	0	a	I will I will I will just add , I put a big summary here , so we could discuss it a bit .
83537	0	a	what i what are your ideas concerning battery versus kinetic ?
83538	0	a	Yeah , you you you
83539	0	a	should we should
83540	0	a	A combination .
83541	1	a	, I think you should use kinetic as a back up .
83542	0	a	Yeah , a combination .
83543	0	a	A combination , yeah .
83544	1	a	, you use the battery and w charge it up with kinetic .
83545	0	a	When you pick it up , it charges up .
83546	0	a	Yeah .
83547	0	a	Like an aku Acu , yeah .
83548	0	a	Yeah .
83549	0	a	Yeah
83550	0	a	yeah , I know .
83551	0	a	Okay .
83552	0	a	Yeah .
83553	0	a	Well , .
83554	0	a	Yeah .
83555	0	a	Psycho kinetic .
83556	0	a	Yeah , I con Exactly .
83557	0	a	Yeah .
83558	0	a	Yeah .
83559	0	a	What what do you think ?
83560	0	a	You agree ?
83561	0	a	Yeah ?
83562	0	a	Both ?
83563	0	a	Okay .
83564	0	a	I I
83565	0	a	I would prefer both too .
83566	1	a	Combine them .
83567	0	a	Yeah .
83568	0	a	Combine them .
83569	0	a	, well that would bring the m m some more costs ,
83570	0	a	but I mean the Who cares , right .
83571	0	a	Okay .
83572	0	a	That is the Project Manager is problem .
83573	0	a	Buy a fifty cents battery and
83574	0	a	Well maybe I have something in my presentation to to cope with that .
83575	0	a	Of course .
83576	0	a	Fifty cent .
83577	0	a	Yeah , well Fifty cent
83578	0	a	, why does not
83579	0	a	And then we have single curved versus double curved .
83580	0	a	That
83581	0	a	Okay .
83582	1	a	No , we will we will just wait and
83583	0	a	, plastic versus rubber .
83584	0	a	Rubber .
83585	0	a	Any ideas ?
83586	0	a	, rubber ?
83587	0	a	You
83588	0	a	, I figured it will be m rather than hard Nah ,
83589	0	a	rubber
83590	0	a	c
83591	0	a	this is a casing , yeah .
83592	0	a	Rubber .
83593	0	a	Yeah .
83594	0	a	, is not possible to make combination with kind of rubber is or bendable remotes where you have got a .
83595	0	a	Or do you think it
83596	0	a	Rubber casing , yeah .
83597	0	a	Rather hard .
83598	0	a	Rubber casing ,
83599	0	a	because well if you use an d a touch screen , it is just a casing around it .
83600	0	a	So , you could go for plastic , but I figured I
83601	0	a	I
83602	0	a	I would choose rubber .
83603	0	a	Yeah .
83604	0	a	Yeah .
83605	1	a	, well d Maybe I can ask it right now the question that I have .
83606	0	a	, is it possible of is it necessary to make a touch screen square ?
83607	0	a	It is not , I think ,
83608	0	a	yeah ?
83609	0	a	We are
83610	0	a	We put fashion in electronics ,
83611	1	a	so maybe we can
83612	0	a	yeah .
83613	0	a	Well , m I do not know .
83614	0	a	Well , I think that touch screens are generally square .
83615	0	a	No .
83616	0	a	Yeah .
83617	0	a	Yeah .
83618	0	a	But it is the case you put around it that makes the shape .
83619	0	a	That is not
83620	0	a	Yeah , that would cover it .
83621	0	a	Yeah okay ,
83622	1	a	but if you have a square LCD screen , and you put a case around it that has like bulbs or that that covers part of the LCD screen .
83623	0	a	That
83624	0	a	That is it is custom customisable
83625	0	a	and
83626	0	a	Yeah , me too .
83627	0	a	That that would solve the problem .
83628	0	a	Oh , yeah .
83629	0	a	Okay , I I get it .
83630	0	a	yeah .
83631	0	a	So so
83632	0	a	so what are the opinions ?
83633	0	a	rubber or plastic ?
83634	0	a	I I
83635	0	a	I prefer rubber .
83636	0	a	Me too .
83637	0	a	Okay .
83638	0	a	Yeah , you too ?
83639	0	a	You sure ?
83640	0	a	You you you seemed to hesitate a bit .
83641	0	a	Yeah ?
83642	0	a	Okay .
83643	0	a	That is good .
83644	0	a	Well , as long a as long as it is it is it is firm , and you do not it is not bendable or something
83645	0	a	, I th
83646	0	a	I think that goes too far .
83647	0	a	yeah .
83648	0	a	Yeah ,
83649	0	a	it it should not it should not flop over when you hold it in your hand
83650	0	a	No , that that that that is going to The the chip set will hold it firm in place , and and and and a LCD screen also
83651	0	a	Yeah it m might it might .
83652	0	a	Oh .
83653	0	a	Okay .
83654	0	a	It might even bounce back when you drop it on the floor .
83655	0	a	Okay .
83656	0	a	, tra traditional versus LCD , well I figured we we all set on that .
83657	0	a	And , then also the simple versus advanced .
83658	1	a	Well I figure if we go for L LCD , we we should have the advanced .
83659	0	a	yeah .
83660	0	a	Yeah .
83661	0	a	So that should not be a problem .
83662	0	a	Okay , well that is my
83663	0	a	, you are welcome .
83664	0	a	Thank you .
83665	1	a	Can I do my thing ?
83666	0	a	It
83667	0	a	Expert map .
83668	1	a	Yeah .
83669	1	a	Do your thing , Tim .
83670	0	a	Do your thing .
83671	0	a	Bring it on .
83672	0	a	Okay
83673	0	a	Last week I went to Paris and Milan for some trend watching .
83674	0	a	For marketing .
83675	0	a	Our research and development department and I went to Paris and Milan .
83676	0	a	In Paris and Milan , we asked different people , differing in age and in income , the amount of money to spend , what they like in design and material nowadays .
83677	0	a	Findings .
83678	0	a	Our main audience , so that is people below forty , prefer the following .
83679	0	a	At first , the colours of fruit .
83680	0	a	Very basic colours , like Janus explained .
83681	0	a	, fresh colours , green , red , strawberry red , yellow , banana yellow .
83682	0	a	, considering material , Yeah .
83683	0	a	They like spongy material ,
83684	0	a	like yeah a sponge ball .
83685	0	a	Spongeball .
83686	0	a	Like a s soft material .
83687	0	a	Janus m mentioned it also .
83688	0	a	Yeah .
83689	0	a	I think he did some some findings himself .
83690	0	a	Well , the Teletubbies sh
83691	0	a	Well , you could .
83692	0	a	You wer you were not in Paris ?
83693	0	a	Okay .
83694	0	a	Like this .
83695	0	a	Like big g flashy colours .
83696	0	a	Flashy .
83697	0	a	Yeah .
83698	0	a	Fresh .
83699	0	a	It is nice , I think .
83700	0	a	Okay , our secondary audience , people above forty a forty years in age , they like the dark traditional colours .
83701	0	a	Yeah , materials like wood that
83702	0	a	No n j just j
83703	0	a	just a w
83704	0	a	No , okay ,
83705	0	a	but just just a wooden look .
83706	0	a	Yeah , but wood is not a not a material
83707	0	a	you which you build a a remote control of .
83708	0	a	You you could .
83709	0	a	Yeah but never seen one .
83710	0	a	Yeah .
83711	0	a	It will float .
83712	0	a	Case .
83713	0	a	Oh , a wooden look , yeah .
83714	0	a	Like you have those fake fake panels on the floor .
83715	0	a	Tables .
83716	0	a	The that is not wood anyway , but
83717	0	a	Okay ?
83718	0	a	But , that is our secondary audience .
83719	0	a	Okay .
83720	0	a	Yeah .
83721	0	a	So , we decided to take
83722	0	a	yeah
83723	0	a	the people below forty .
83724	0	a	Yeah .
83725	0	a	So , that this does not apply .
83726	0	a	Kay , the third .
83727	0	a	, there are some overall thoughts about new remote controls .
83728	0	a	They have to look fancy .
83729	0	a	, they should be technological in innovative .
83730	0	a	That means there have to be fancy things in .
83731	0	a	, and easy to use .
83732	0	a	But that is common .
83733	0	a	My personal preferences .
83734	1	a	We have to aim at a mu at the main audience .
83735	1	a	And , therefore use fresh colours .
83736	0	a	Would you prefer that you can choose the colour of your remote control or
83737	0	a	Okay .
83738	1	a	, I will I will come to that in a second point .
83739	1	a	Here , think about removable covers , as seen in mobile telephon telephone market .
83740	0	a	Okay .
83741	1	a	To customise your own remote control .
83742	0	a	Like the Nokia the removable covers , just put a red on it and go to the shop and buy a green one .
83743	0	a	Yeah .
83744	0	a	Okay .
83745	1	a	, a third , material being used could well be stuff like rubber .
83746	0	a	, two advantages .
83747	0	a	, it fits within the current market trends .
83748	0	a	And it adds safety to your remote when you drop it .
83749	0	a	So
83750	0	a	to come back to your question , I think and the people in Milan and Paris also think that the rubber should be pretty hard .
83751	0	a	Like seen on regular mobile phones .
83752	0	a	Actually , they have a lot in common .
83753	0	a	The phones and the
83754	0	a	Yeah .
83755	0	a	Well , I actually saw a phone that you could use as a remote , so Yeah .
83756	0	a	Yeah .
83757	1	a	Maybe you could use your remote as a phone .
83758	0	a	Okay .
83759	0	a	Hey .
83760	0	a	Hey .
83761	0	a	That might be a next step .
83762	0	a	There are numbers on it , so
83763	0	a	So that you say SPSS , and it goes to
83764	0	a	Okay .
83765	0	a	Yeah , exactly .
83766	1	a	, in my second sheet of personal preferences , we have to reconsider the speech function recognition .
83767	0	a	, it is very innovative .
83768	0	a	Innovative .
83769	0	a	Yeah , like something .
83770	0	a	You you can see that the market is just screaming for new technologies , like speak speech recognition and stuff .
83771	0	a	But , we have to keep the cost in in mind ,
83772	0	a	but it
83773	0	a	Yeah , it it can be very expensive .
83774	0	a	Twelve fifty
83775	0	a	When your parents are watching some boring program , you can take the remote and do something else .
83776	0	a	Kay , second .
83777	1	a	, building games like Snake or Tetris to amuse the younger users .
83778	0	a	, also the link with mobile phones .
83779	0	a	Yeah , but you do not use that th games when you watching television , I think .
83780	0	a	No , but
83781	0	a	No , okay .
83782	0	a	Well , yeah .
83783	0	a	But you do not use games when you are d when you are making a telephone call .
83784	0	a	It is just the same .
83785	0	a	Yeah .
83786	0	a	Yeah , okay .
83787	0	a	When you are at college .
83788	0	a	You take your remote with you to school .
83789	0	a	No .
83790	0	a	You take your remote control with you .
83791	0	a	Take it .
83792	0	a	You al you also take t
83793	0	a	you take your IPac and go play games .
83794	0	a	Yeah .
83795	0	a	Yeah .
83796	0	a	Yeah .
83797	0	a	Well , I do that , but
83798	0	a	Okay , and
83799	1	a	And third , I stick with it , the log in functionality with the slogan , take parental control to a new dimension .
83800	0	a	Ooh .
83801	0	a	Very nice .
83802	0	a	That is it .
83803	0	a	S
83804	0	a	great .
83805	0	a	In
83806	0	a	Okay .
83807	0	a	the interface contents .
83808	0	a	Well that is a just simple PowerPoint mock up
83809	1	a	I want to m make it more as dynamic for you
83810	1	a	so I will draw there .
83811	1	a	But , the main concept is take one big touch screen .
83812	1	a	, always display the primary buttons clear and visible .
83813	1	a	Maybe even li like this with u uses of a lot of space .
83814	1	a	And make the menu structure changeable .
83815	0	a	So if you press system , that is
83816	0	a	Yeah , well m multiple system options can , maybe five or ten or or one , can fit in .
83817	0	a	Or maybe even a step further when you want to t have some other options that are not programmable with one horizontal button .
83818	0	a	And other buttons can may be displayed here if that is necessary .
83819	0	a	And well , how do do we want to look at f Yeah
83820	0	a	Does a remote look
83821	0	a	Well , it is you have gotta hold it in one hand .
83822	0	a	So the middle like all remotes have to be in a little bit small , so you can put it in inside your hands .
83823	0	a	And some remotes you can use with your thumb .
83824	0	a	But I think that is too difficult for this one .
83825	1	a	So you can make it s a little broader .
83826	1	a	Yeah .
83827	1	a	And here ?
83828	0	a	And maybe use your thumb on the on the main buttons .
83829	0	a	And use your other hands on the menu structure .
83830	1	a	So here are going to be the program buttons .
83831	1	a	One , two , three , four , et cetera .
83832	1	a	And the the volume control and program control maybe .
83833	1	a	And , down here , , I added , this could be one big LCD .
83834	1	a	, the menu structure .
83835	0	a	So you can use it in in this way .
83836	0	a	One thing you have gotta keep in mind , keep the remote clear of too much functions at the same time .
83837	0	a	, know that if you are changing the menu structure here ,
83838	1	a	And well , I still believe you should keep displaying the buttons .
83839	1	a	But if you are programming the colour of the TV , do not display twenty other options that are possible .
83840	1	a	Just keep it as simple as as possible .
83841	1	a	And do not use too many levels .
83842	1	a	Do not have to select a screen first and then brightness and then colour and un plus , and push plus twenty times .
83843	1	a	But just the just in one button if possible .
83844	0	a	And , well , you kn you all know the TV levels .
83845	0	a	, channel one , two .
83846	0	a	And when you get to n to to ten , and want to go back , well you have a problem .
83847	0	a	Just m most most modern TVs , you you press one zero , and it goes to ten .
83848	0	a	And else , to one and through after that .
83849	0	a	So the s a button less .
83850	0	a	And , things like teletext , put them in the menu .
83851	0	a	Things like
83852	0	a	Yeah .
83853	0	a	Yeah .
83854	1	a	what do you think about a back and forth come up button ?
83855	0	a	L like in internet explorer .
83856	0	a	Yeah ,
83857	0	a	yeah
83858	0	a	w
83859	0	a	Yeah ,
83860	0	a	I
83861	0	a	I find I must trying to tell it .
83862	0	a	Is volume plus and minus ?
83863	0	a	And this is program plus and minus .
83864	0	a	Yes .
83865	0	a	Yeah okay , but does it that is for going from four to five .
83866	0	a	But if you go from two to eight , and you want Yeah , and on two .
83867	0	a	Or if you are watching Studio Sports on on seventeen , and your wife is watching some soap on
83868	0	a	two Well
83869	0	a	yes , I think that is a good idea .
83870	0	a	That you can switch switch easy .
83871	1	a	But , well m my preference would to be put it in the menu structure .
83872	0	a	Yeah it is .
83873	0	a	Yeah .
83874	0	a	And if you are using that button a lot of times , well of course the menu will still be displayed on the screen .
83875	0	a	You just do not have to play games in between .
83876	0	a	But if you are really switching between two channels , you wo not have time to d use the other options .
83877	0	a	no .
83878	0	a	, yeah already already told that .
83879	0	a	That is it .
83880	0	a	Yeah .
83881	0	a	That is my conclusion .
83882	0	a	Okay .
83883	0	a	Oh , okay .
83884	1	a	I think we can discuss a little about the the three kind of revolutionary things Tim came with .
83885	0	a	The parental control , the games , and the voice recognition .
83886	0	a	There is n not too much decision on that one
83887	0	a	so I think that parental control is a good function to to put in the remote .
83888	0	a	I do not know how you think about it .
83889	0	a	Yeah .
83890	0	a	Well , I agree ,
83891	1	a	just put it in the menu structure somewhere .
83892	0	a	Yeah .
83893	1	a	, yeah system properties , parental control .
83894	0	a	Yeah
83895	0	a	but
83896	0	a	What I see
83897	1	a	How I see it is you put it on the the remote
83898	1	a	and then you have
83899	1	a	like a Windows log on screen with parents , children .
83900	0	a	Yeah .
83901	0	a	Something like that .
83902	0	a	Yeah .
83903	0	a	, w well
83904	0	a	, yeah .
83905	0	a	And w when you want to use the parents option , you have to
83906	0	a	Yeah , ok Yeah .
83907	0	a	It it has to be fast .
83908	0	a	You do not want to to go down and watch the news at eight o'clock and turn it on and wait twenty seconds for for the log on screen and then remember your code and all kinds of settings .
83909	0	a	No
83910	0	a	but I think most people find it much more important that their children do not watch sex or violence on the television , and wait ten or fifteen seconds longer
83911	0	a	, so they can finally watch it because of that .
83912	0	a	Why
83913	1	a	You c may use like when there is XP , a simple log on , d you just push one or two or three .
83914	0	a	Yeah .
83915	0	a	Yeah .
83916	0	a	Yeah .
83917	0	a	Pu push parents .
83918	1	a	And if you push parents , then Yeah .
83919	0	a	That then
83920	1	a	then then you have to go to three digit log in .
83921	1	a	To log in .
83922	0	a	Yeah .
83923	0	a	And if you puts a
83924	0	a	Uh huh .
83925	0	a	Like two one three .
83926	0	a	And it is in .
83927	1	a	And if you w you push p children , you do not have to log in , but you can only watch children is channels or
83928	0	a	Okay .
83929	0	a	Yeah .
83930	0	a	It automatically goes Yeah .
83931	0	a	Yeah .
83932	0	a	Yeah .
83933	0	a	Well
83934	0	a	Yeah .
83935	0	a	I do not know if it is worth the time and effort we are going to spend on it .
83936	0	a	Because well it is a simple function , but it is going to take a lot of resources and a lot of time to programming it .
83937	0	a	Because you will have to start working with the profiles and such .
83938	0	a	And I am not sure if it is actually worth investing that much time and effort into it .
83939	0	a	I do not know what
83940	0	a	But , well , if you want to
83941	0	a	I i i if we in incorporate the parental control , let is say we do , and and well whatever , cho child just goes up to the TV and presses up for instance .
83942	0	a	Well I think that is a b there is a big market for it ,
83943	0	a	because you
83944	0	a	Yeah , you read many times in magazines same kind of stuff , and you heard on the news that that he
83945	0	a	Yeah , they believe that children are influenced by the television ,
83946	0	a	and
83947	0	a	Well , we are we are aiming to below forty years .
83948	0	a	yeah .
83949	0	a	V violent TV .
83950	0	a	But there are a lot of people will below forty who have children in young age who who want to not watch violent or
83951	0	a	Yeah .
83952	1	a	Well , maybe some idea on that .
83953	1	a	Just make through a remote as it is , but make an option to insert profiles ,
83954	0	a	cause if my grandad would buy this remote , he would not want to bother with all all the all the things to do .
83955	0	a	Yeah .
83956	0	a	Yeah , of course .
83957	0	a	Yeah .
83958	1	a	Just make it an option in menu , ins install powerful profiles or something .
83959	0	a	Yeah yeah .
83960	0	a	Yeah .
83961	0	a	That is a that is a better idea ?
83962	0	a	Yeah .
83963	0	a	Yeah ,
83964	1	a	w It just has to be w when it is deliver out of the store , it has to be just simple and plain .
83965	0	a	But if you want to install it personally If I got kids , and I could choose between two remote controls .
83966	0	a	Yeah , okay .
83967	0	a	One w with parent control and one without , and I would would buy the one with .
83968	0	a	Yeah , with and one without .
83969	0	a	Yeah .
83970	0	a	, b well , still some question I have about how to incorporate those ones .
83971	0	a	I th
83972	0	a	Yeah .
83973	0	a	You are thinking about some channels they cannot see , but
83974	0	a	well , I I when I think , oh yeah , for the f for all the standard channels , and only for maybe after ten o'clock in the evening violent films and movies will come and maybe maybe some some timing will be needed instead of of channels , because if you are watching , I do not know , you are in the at day , cartoons will come up m on maybe Friday night .
83975	0	a	Yeah .
83976	0	a	I do not know .
83977	0	a	Yeah , maybe it can work with show view .
83978	0	a	, you you can control your video recorder with show view .
83979	0	a	, when you tick in a number , it will start and end recording .
83980	0	a	But maybe there is some option that that t the kind of show view numbers are violent , and that they are blocked out .
83981	0	a	Yeah , the disadvantage vantage is that someone will has to send all the show view numbers of the programs that they remotes and edit it all ,
83982	0	a	will have to decide
83983	0	a	That is not possible .
83984	0	a	Yeah .
83985	0	a	That is true .
83986	0	a	Yeah .
83987	0	a	Yeah
83988	0	a	but yeah
83989	0	a	but that is not possible .
83990	0	a	Yeah .
83991	0	a	Yeah .
83992	0	a	Well , nob nobody is stopping the child from well checking the channel .
83993	0	a	Well , yeah you could say if parental control is only it it will go from fourteen to sixteen with the page up then , but
83994	0	a	But that
83995	0	a	Well , I am not sure because for that to happen , you d you will have to receive a signal from the remote control , so it would ,
83996	0	a	yeah , have to be constant constant signalling .
83997	0	a	Yeah .
83998	1	a	What m what may be better is to incorporate an a separate device that that you can program with the remote control .
83999	1	a	And that provides parental control , for instance .
84000	1	a	And that is just an optional device .
84001	0	a	So there is n that is there is
84002	1	a	besides the remote control , you will have a separate
84003	0	a	Yeah ?
84004	0	a	Yeah , that is true .
84005	0	a	I would not put it in an optional device .
84006	0	a	That that then then then it becomes too much , I think .
84007	1	a	If we do it , we we must do it in a kind of ways that like a profile , a parent profile , and a family profile , and otherwise .
84008	0	a	Yeah , and
84009	0	a	And and you know w when you install another device , children can still go up to the TV , p pop open the thing and and and g go to a channel .
84010	0	a	Yeah , on a separate menu option .
84011	0	a	Yeah .
84012	0	a	That is true , but at same instant , same happens when you have remote control .
84013	0	a	Yeah , yeah of course .
84014	0	a	So But , only difference is the the people buying the remote control will now get the f added feature of parental control , and those people would not necessary want it .
84015	0	a	But
84016	0	a	Yeah .
84017	0	a	it is
84018	0	a	Yeah .
84019	0	a	So , you you would be
84020	0	a	Yeah .
84021	0	a	Yeah , okay .
84022	0	a	But it is just an an added feature feature .
84023	0	a	Yeah .
84024	0	a	Okay .
84025	0	a	And what do you guys think of the games in the voice recognition ?
84026	0	a	I personally think that that becomes too much .
84027	0	a	Yeah ,
84028	0	a	well yeah ,
84029	0	a	I
84030	0	a	A mail too from management that it is very popular to use voice recon recognition .
84031	0	a	It is more like it gets you to the functionality , but
84032	0	a	Yeah .
84033	0	a	But I do not think when you are watching TV , hearing loud noises from the TV , someone screaming one , and you f the channel switches ,
84034	0	a	Yeah .
84035	0	a	yeah .
84036	0	a	Yeah .
84037	0	a	Yeah .
84038	0	a	Yeah , like f voice recognition is too much , I think .
84039	0	a	Yeah .
84040	0	a	But
84041	0	a	games .
84042	0	a	Okay .
84043	0	a	And games ?
84044	0	a	That would
84045	0	a	Okay .
84046	0	a	It does not
84047	0	a	Yeah .
84048	0	a	Yeah .
84049	0	a	I can see games happening .
84050	0	a	W you can put it on chip anyway , so As long as it is is not a primary feature of the remote ,
84051	0	a	but
84052	0	a	Optional in
84053	0	a	But how we do it ?
84054	0	a	Well , I think also it is a good idea , buts very difficult to incorporate .
84055	0	a	Yeah .
84056	0	a	That that does not c
84057	0	a	that does not co
84058	0	a	Yeah , that that does not cost a lot of extra resources , I think .
84059	0	a	So that will that that that must be in it , you think ?
84060	0	a	Okay .
84061	0	a	Yeah , that will be nice .
84062	0	a	So the games are in it .
84063	0	a	The voice recognition are not .
84064	0	a	And the parental control are
84065	0	a	optional ?
84066	0	a	Yeah .
84067	0	a	Yeah , it is it is in it .
84068	0	a	But too ma I I think so , but
84069	0	a	Yeah .
84070	1	a	So we should make it too complex .
84071	1	a	Is t some menu function , you choose parental control , and maybe four files will emerge from menu where put it on .
84072	0	a	Okay .
84073	0	a	But how how it is going to work will f be a problem .
84074	0	a	Yeah , okay .
84075	0	a	, but will there
84076	1	a	Like the first idea from You can buy it without and with parental contr control ?
84077	1	a	Or are we going to put it in and just
84078	0	a	Yeah ?
84079	0	a	yeah .
84080	0	a	Well
84081	1	a	I I think best would be to put it in and make it an menu option .
84082	0	a	To put
84083	0	a	Yeah , to put it in always .
84084	0	a	You can put on
84085	0	a	Yeah .
84086	1	a	And you can just s when you buy it , you can select personal preference , parental control on , and the password or something .
84087	0	a	Well , I do not know .
84088	1	a	I I figure if you had two different remotes , you could bo choose one with well a receiver in it .
84089	0	a	So you could actually easily build in parental control .
84090	0	a	But it would would be more expensive .
84091	0	a	So , a and that that way you could make cheap model and a expensive model .
84092	0	a	Could ma make the simple model and the deluxe model , for instance .
84093	0	a	Oh , it is a p
84094	0	a	Yeah .
84095	0	a	Yeah , but TVs are not capable of sending .
84096	0	a	Yes they are .
84097	0	a	Yeah ?
84098	0	a	I thought they were just a able to receive .
84099	0	a	Yeah .
84100	0	a	Yeah , you yo
84101	0	a	Yeah , but most often not .
84102	0	a	Yeah , you you have some TVs any
84103	0	a	Yeah .
84104	0	a	Yeah , some .
84105	0	a	But
84106	0	a	Yeah .
84107	0	a	That is true , that is true .
84108	1	a	Well , maybe you just have to restrict it to what programs , where the parent says , you cannot watch channel seven , nine , and ten , and you cannot watch all channels after ten o'clock .
84109	1	a	And there is just some little clock in the remote .
84110	0	a	Well yeah ,
84111	0	a	you could you could easily
84112	0	a	you could easily you could easily to the mote control .
84113	0	a	Yeah , j just some rules .
84114	0	a	Yeah .
84115	0	a	But you still have the problem about the television itself .
84116	0	a	No , no , it is very simple .
84117	0	a	There th
84118	0	a	I h
84119	0	a	I have seen some of remotes who have a clock in it .
84120	0	a	Yeah ,
84121	0	a	yeah
84122	0	a	yeah .
84123	0	a	So , the remote does does not transmit when it is after twelve clock .
84124	0	a	Yeah , okay .
84125	0	a	But , on the TV at least my TV , is a is a compartment which you can press .
84126	0	a	Yeah ?
84127	0	a	Yeah .
84128	0	a	And there are buttons behind it which you can use , if you d if you do not if you do not have a
84129	0	a	Yeah .
84130	0	a	Yeah .
84131	0	a	Yeah .
84132	0	a	Yeah .
84133	0	a	Well , that is
84134	0	a	To put it very blunt , that is not our problem .
84135	0	a	Just have the parents buy some glue
84136	0	a	and It is not not a part of the remote .
84137	0	a	Yeah .
84138	0	a	Yeah , of course .
84139	0	a	Yeah , that is true .
84140	0	a	Yeah , that is true .
84141	0	a	You have to f Yeah .
84142	0	a	Yeah , you could you could you could go like
84143	0	a	that that would actually make things a lot more easy .
84144	0	a	, or make it ourselves very diffic
84145	0	a	Yeah .
84146	1	a	You could just blame it on television and make it their problem .
84147	0	a	Yeah .
84148	0	a	Yeah .
84149	0	a	Yeah , I figured I figure we could do that .
84150	0	a	Yeah ,
84151	0	a	yeah , sure .
84152	0	a	Okay .
84153	0	a	Or j Yeah .
84154	0	a	, I am not sure what marketing thinks about it , but
84155	0	a	User profile .
84156	0	a	I have to consult my legal advisor about it .
84157	0	a	Okay .
84158	0	a	So I think we have decided on the things that from Janus , the energy , the combination between battery and kinetic .
84159	0	a	The case will be double curved and rubber , in a fr flashy fruity colour that with cover is removable .
84160	0	a	The buttons will be touch screen .
84161	0	a	but there may not be too many buttons .
84162	0	a	And in the the menu structure , there must not to be Five minutes to go .
84163	0	a	, too too many levels .
84164	0	a	And it must be easy to use .
84165	0	a	The parental control will be incorporated , but it must be not too complex .
84166	0	a	And the games are in it .
84167	0	a	So
84168	0	a	I think we have we have decided , okay .
84169	0	a	Okay .
84170	0	a	Consensus .
84171	0	a	, little more .
84172	1	a	Oh .
84173	1	a	Oh .
84174	0	a	Oh .
84175	1	a	I I have one thing left .
84176	0	a	Yeah .
84177	0	a	Maybe for Jerome .
84178	1	a	Yeah ?
84179	1	a	I am listening .
84180	0	a	, the views .
84181	1	a	Maybe it is handy to build in an expert view and a simple view .
84182	0	a	Like a like a moat or s or something .
84183	0	a	Yeah .
84184	0	a	Yeah .
84185	0	a	, well
84186	1	a	What I was thinking about is just a menu structure , when you do not use it is simple .
84187	0	a	Like at
84188	1	a	In the experts view , you have a lot of more buttons .
84189	0	a	Yeah , but you have that in the
84190	0	a	Yeah .
84191	0	a	Yeah .
84192	1	a	And when you push system properties , entire list pops up with e ev all kind of f stuff you can program .
84193	0	a	You use the
84194	0	a	Yeah .
84195	0	a	yeah ,
84196	0	a	okay .
84197	0	a	It is already incorporated a little in that concept .
84198	0	a	Fairly enough .
84199	0	a	Yeah .
84200	1	a	Well yeah , you you could actually build in a function that you can program it yourself , for the more advanced users .
84201	0	a	Yeah , wh which buttons you like or not .
84202	0	a	Yeah , which buttons do you want to in it .
84203	0	a	Because you can you can like build in a back forward button , and some po somebody would just want to watch two channels .
84204	0	a	Yeah .
84205	0	a	Yeah .
84206	1	a	Just leave the other numbers away .
84207	0	a	Okay .
84208	0	a	Yeah , you could you could m have people want want that .
84209	1	a	We take it to the other meeting ,
84210	0	a	okay ?
84211	1	a	I have a little w little chat to do
84212	0	a	and then we finish .
84213	0	a	Okay .
84214	0	a	Go on .
84215	0	a	, yeah , sure .
84216	0	a	A little chat .
84217	0	a	I went to a master class and two things are are can come in handy for us .
84218	0	a	First thing is we talked about knowledge management .
84219	0	a	Knowledge engineering and the fact that that that the idea of knowledge , sharing and learning knowledge from other companies is like that .
84220	0	a	It is it is very hot at the moment , so it is it is mostly for the management expert to to look what other
84221	0	a	marketing
84222	0	a	or did I said management ?
84223	0	a	Oh .
84224	0	a	Marketing .
84225	0	a	Management .
84226	0	a	Just talking about myself .
84227	0	a	Yeah , that is my function , to
84228	1	a	Okay .
84229	0	a	W
84230	0	a	What other companies had to also with the the the the marketing campaign when they put on a newer remote , just some
84231	0	a	Yeah .
84232	1	a	Go on .
84233	0	a	Import export .
84234	0	a	And another one .
84235	0	a	Som some bench marker .
84236	0	a	, they are a ha they are at
84237	0	a	Yeah , benchmarking , that is the word I saw .
84238	0	a	I could not
84239	0	a	Okay , another thing is there were there there was a survey , and it came out that people like to buy things from a single large provider , instead of those who are partnering with us .
84240	0	a	So , we must we must bring it as if Real Reaction is is big company , a trustful company ,
84241	0	a	and it has m
84242	0	a	Okay .
84243	0	a	How
84244	0	a	I know a marketing name for our product .
84245	0	a	R th R to the third power .
84246	0	a	R three .
84247	0	a	Real Reaction remote .
84248	0	a	I had a
84249	0	a	I had another idea to put the whole the whole idea of Real Reaction and a single brand and that kind of thing .
84250	0	a	Oh .
84251	0	a	Bling .
84252	1	a	When you put on remote , you see a kind of a just like when you telephone , you see a little animation .
84253	0	a	, logo .
84254	0	a	Yeah ?
84255	0	a	Yeah .
84256	1	a	Real Reaction remote .
84257	1	a	And with the with the with the motto , we put fashion in electronics .
84258	0	a	And then you go The
84259	0	a	Yeah .
84260	0	a	Yeah .
84261	0	a	Yeah , okay ,
84262	0	a	but it has to be like a split second , because you have to put in a code also and
84263	0	a	Yeah .
84264	0	a	Yeah .
84265	0	a	Well , you can show somebody a logo for point five seconds , they will still remember it .
84266	0	a	And it it l linger on every time you see it .
84267	0	a	But w th the idea from this thing is that we must present it as a as we are a a single large provider who will stand on our own .
84268	1	a	Well , if you if you have the l LCD screen , you can you can have a small logo i at the bottom .
84269	0	a	Yeah .
84270	1	a	And it could just stay there .
84271	1	a	That spins around like all the time .
84272	0	a	yep ,
84273	0	a	yeah .
84274	0	a	Yeah , that spins around or something .
84275	0	a	Very annoying .
84276	0	a	Also also .
84277	0	a	But we we are
84278	0	a	Yeah
84279	0	a	yeah
84280	0	a	y
84281	0	a	yeah
84282	0	a	yeah .

84284	0	a	Yeah .
84285	0	a	Yeah .
84286	0	a	Yeah , something like that .
84287	1	a	Okay , but think about that kind of things .

84361	0	a	, first we have a prototype presentation by G and G .
84362	0	a	Yo .
84363	0	a	J and J .
84364	0	a	Afterwards some
84365	0	a	eval eval evalu

84371	0	a	evaluation crit criteria .
84372	0	a	, in combination with the finance
84373	0	a	I
84374	0	a	I received a an an Excel file which we have to fill in later on .
84375	0	a	, you see .
84376	0	a	, and then we must see if we stay under the twelve and a half Euro .
84377	0	a	Interesting .
84378	0	a	, okay .
84379	0	a	So , that is that is a big l
84380	0	a	so let is wait it
84381	0	a	we have we have must ,
84382	1	a	we must have some time for that because it will be yeah , quite a lot of mathematics .
84383	0	a	Oops .
84384	0	a	Cool .
84385	0	a	That is going to be t problem .
84386	0	a	Some creative
84387	0	a	Oh .
84388	0	a	Yeah .
84389	0	a	And after that , an evaluation of the process how we how we have done it here with the SMARTboard , with the with our laptops , with the all all this .
84390	0	a	And afterwards , we closing .
84391	0	a	Once again , forty minutes ,
84392	1	a	so let is start .
84393	0	a	Ok okay .
84394	1	a	I would g give the word to G and G for the prototype presentation .
84395	1	a	Shall I give a short introduction and then
84396	0	a	Okay .
84397	0	a	Yeah , well sure .
84398	0	a	J and J .
84399	0	a	J and J .
84400	0	a	Jane and Jane .
84401	0	a	J and J , okay .
84402	1	a	Kay guys , take it away .
84403	0	a	Hi .
84404	0	a	Take it away .
84405	0	a	, this was our first concept .
84406	0	a	We decided to use a single touch screen .
84407	0	a	So , we have worked out this concepts , how to how to hold it , where to put the buttons and and stuff .
84408	0	a	And , well , we began with with a form of shape , that is is easy to hold w in one hand , left or right handed .
84409	0	a	So , we made i it a little bit less thick and it has some ar artistic meaning .
84410	0	a	No ?
84411	0	a	This is not nothing .
84412	0	a	Idea maybe is better .
84413	0	a	well , during the meeting I showed you the concept of placing the buttons on top , usable with your thumb , and the menu structure , if necessary , with your other hand , so it is just going to hold it easily .
84414	0	a	And it has to be acce accessible with your other hand too , of course .
84415	0	a	So we began working out a concept .
84416	0	a	Yeah , well , and as you saw , we would just have the basic remote with the panel LCD screen .
84417	0	a	Well , these would be the main buttons , h you could change them later on in your own profile if you want to .
84418	0	a	But , well it is standard they will be delivered with this kind of set up .
84419	0	a	We have the more advanced menu setting right here .
84420	0	a	We have the sub menus and stu stuff .
84421	0	a	We made a top oh , or a front view .
84422	0	a	Just so like you want to back view .
84423	0	a	As you can see , this there , there are two weird bumps in it .
84424	0	a	This is for the added effect of well y youth and dynamic .
84425	0	a	And this is for the artistic effect .
84426	1	a	Well , what we figured is we will show you a picture later on
84427	0	a	you have more b a better idea after that .
84428	0	a	But , idea is for to stay in balance with these two with these two .
84429	0	a	And so when you put it on the table , it will just lay down .
84430	0	a	It wo not roll around or stuff .
84431	0	a	But it will lie more in your hand like an old telephone maybe , or like these old phones .
84432	0	a	Y you
84433	0	a	you may get the idea .
84434	0	a	So thi this is about how we figured it should be .
84435	0	a	The s panel we g you would hide with some more rubber layers , like we discussed early on .
84436	0	a	, you would s you would not see the straight panel , but more fluidly and round .
84437	0	a	Yeah ,
84438	0	a	the panel just of course goes like this .
84439	0	a	Yeah .
84440	0	a	But the overlaying layer is a little bit curved and stuff .
84441	0	a	Okay .
84442	0	a	No , okay .
84443	0	a	And , in these bumps you could actually put some electronics
84444	0	a	that would
84445	0	a	you can make a more thinner design ,
84446	0	a	and that would actually look very nice ,
84447	0	a	yeah .
84448	0	a	Yeah .
84449	0	a	Yeah .
84450	0	a	And , about the colour , what have
84451	0	a	Yeah , f , as colours , do you do you have the picture in
84452	0	a	Oh yeah .
84453	0	a	Yeah .
84454	0	a	Oh , we added that this can be held with your hands for this maximum is om
84455	0	a	yeah , one and a half centimetres .
84456	0	a	So , you have room here for your battery and maybe even other electronic chips .
84457	0	a	S and you can just be the the layer of the touchscreen and some have some wires underneath it to make it as thin as possible in the middle for good grip .
84458	0	a	Okay .
84459	0	a	Yeah .
84460	0	a	Now , well this is the idea about the bumps .
84461	0	a	, you can see there is a v a very youthful dynamic exterior .
84462	0	a	It
84463	0	a	you just want to hold it you you are young and dynamic like us .
84464	0	a	Is l
84465	0	a	it is like an Easter egg .
84466	0	a	Yeah , it is like an e but this is for children .
84467	0	a	Yeah .
84468	0	a	We we want a more adult version .
84469	0	a	But , this is like a remote control for children .
84470	0	a	It is called a weemote
84471	0	a	Weemote .
84472	0	a	Weemote .
84473	0	a	A weemote .
84474	0	a	Yeah .
84475	0	a	Hey , that is actually a brilliant marketing stand .
84476	0	a	, but
84477	0	a	So this actually basic the idea .
84478	0	a	Yeah .
84479	0	a	Wait what I w got in mind .
84480	1	a	We we just want to build a more adult vers adult version of of this .
84481	0	a	Yeah , I can imagine that .
84482	0	a	And and for colours , we we figured starting with basic colours like white or metallic grey .
84483	0	a	Those are the technological colours actually ,
84484	0	a	so it d
84485	0	a	Or blue or whatever .
84486	0	a	Yeah .
84487	1	a	It would be best to to appeal to a broad public and make the covers exchangeable ,
84488	0	a	so the young people will buy an orange and a red and blue and a purple , but when the o older people go in the shop and they see an orange remote control , it would be less appealing than a white one .
84489	0	a	And young people , we think , are a little bit more flexible , they think , I will buy for a couple of Euros some noi nice hip
84490	0	a	Well ,
84491	0	a	I think a cover is necessary ,
84492	0	a	cause als otherwise you will just have the LCD screen .
84493	1	a	Maybe it is an idea to sell it without a cover , so that you can pick a cover in the in the shop .
84494	0	a	Yeah , okay .
84495	0	a	Yeah , okay .
84496	1	a	So , there must be some cheap standard cover , maybe white or something , that is could comes with it and you can buy ,
84497	0	a	so we can make extra money .
84498	0	a	Yeah , but you d you must not forget that our target aim is younger people .
84499	0	a	Oui okay .
84500	0	a	, we had decided to put some flashy fruity colours in it , and in the survey from Milan and Paris it it came out that the d the older people are more willing to to spend money on extra features .
84501	0	a	Okay .
84502	1	a	So I think it will be a better idea to have some flashy fruity colours as as a standard ,
84503	0	a	and for the people who really want a more sophisticated , more traditional look , they are willing to pay that .
84504	0	a	The other way around , you mean .
84505	0	a	Oh yeah .
84506	0	a	Uh huh .
84507	0	a	Yeah .
84508	0	a	They want they want more luxury stuff , but they have the money to do it and they want to b to buy that .
84509	0	a	Okay .
84510	1	a	So , maybe it is an idea to put that as an extra and not as a standard .
84511	0	a	Yeah .
84512	0	a	Yeah .
84513	0	a	Yeah , maybe yeah , perhaps you are right .
84514	0	a	, I I would I would actually agree with this sounds logical .
84515	0	a	Okay , yeah .
84516	1	a	An another idea .
84517	1	a	, maybe we could develop a cover with wood style .
84518	0	a	Yeah .
84519	0	a	They will please the elder users as well .
84520	0	a	Yeah .
84521	0	a	Well yeah ,
84522	0	a	a colour of
84523	1	a	a wood style , a white c and a couple of h hip fruity colours .
84524	0	a	Yeah .
84525	0	a	Yes .
84526	0	a	Nah .
84527	1	a	And lea l delivered standard with a fruity colour , but not too not too much .
84528	0	a	Yeah .
84529	0	a	Not not too yeah .
84530	1	a	This is banana and mango , not not purple or p orange and yellow .
84531	0	a	Yeah , exactly .
84532	0	a	Yeah .
84533	1	a	But , the mai I think th the standard must be some kind of attractive flashy colours .
84534	0	a	Yeah .
84535	0	a	Or blue or
84536	1	a	Not too , but w a little ,
84537	0	a	because that is our aim .
84538	0	a	Yeah ,
84539	1	a	li like like this like this .
84540	0	a	Yeah .
84541	0	a	This is not this is not too much , is it ?
84542	0	a	I f
84543	0	a	Yeah .
84544	0	a	Yeah .
84545	0	a	Yeah , okay .
84546	0	a	No .
84547	0	a	Yeah .
84548	0	a	Well , the buttons do not have to be all all of
84549	0	a	yeah .
84550	0	a	Well I I I think so .
84551	0	a	The buttons ,
84552	0	a	I
84553	0	a	Yeah , something like this would be nice .
84554	0	a	Yeah , except for the buttons it is it could be a standard model .
84555	0	a	It
84556	0	a	Yeah .
84557	0	a	Okay .
84558	0	a	Okay .
84559	0	a	Okay .
84560	0	a	Okay , that is that is it from us .
84561	0	a	Thank you .

84566	0	a	Okay .
84567	0	a	During the
84568	0	a	Oh .
84569	0	a	During the design design life cycle we we made lot of requirements and trend analysis and stuff .
84570	0	a	Sorry .
84571	0	a	, now is the time to evaluate our prototype concept to to the past requirements .
84572	1	a	So we are going to evaluate the design according to the past user requirements and trends analysis .
84573	1	a	, we are going to do that with a seven point scale .
84574	1	a	Opening a Word document now .
84575	0	a	Okay .
84576	0	a	One
84577	1	a	oh , okay , I have to expla explain something .
84578	0	a	We have to be consensive about about things .
84579	0	a	So , it has to be a group group decision .
84580	0	a	Okay ?
84581	0	a	We are going to vote .
84582	0	a	Okay ,
84583	0	a	so we gon we going to evaluate the Yeah , the the thing we saw .
84584	0	a	We
84585	0	a	yeah ?
84586	0	a	The prototype .
84587	0	a	Yeah .
84588	0	a	Okay , just saw .
84589	0	a	Okay , one .
84590	0	a	The remote control is designed for people with age below forty .
84591	0	a	Yeah .
84592	0	a	Seven ? , true .
84593	0	a	Seven is false .
84594	0	a	Yeah , b one or Most true ?
84595	0	a	Yeah ,
84596	0	a	so
84597	0	a	so a o one is appropriate ?
84598	0	a	Or , more like a four .
84599	0	a	Sorry .
84600	0	a	Yeah , one I think .
84601	0	a	Why ?
84602	0	a	Yeah , it is not just designed for people under the age of forty .
84603	0	a	It is also designed for people above forty .
84604	0	a	Yeah .
84605	0	a	Yeah .
84606	0	a	So
84607	0	a	I have I have
84608	0	a	Yeah , two or three ,
84609	0	a	because it is not just
84610	0	a	the qu question is aimed at is it designed for people with age below forty .
84611	0	a	No no , a little more in the middle .
84612	0	a	No , three or yeah .
84613	0	a	Three .
84614	0	a	Okay .
84615	0	a	But it is also designed for people of age above forty .
84616	0	a	, exactly .
84617	0	a	So ,
84618	0	a	I will say it is about three .
84619	0	a	Exactly .
84620	0	a	Yeah ,
84621	0	a	it will be primary appealing to to m minus forty , but also appealing to
84622	0	a	Yeah .
84623	0	a	Okay .
84624	0	a	Three .
84625	0	a	Yeah .
84626	0	a	But also for yeah
84627	0	a	, okay .

84668	0	a	False ?
84669	0	a	And volume ?
84670	0	a	True .
84671	0	a	, no .
84672	0	a	No teletext buttons .
84673	0	a	Teletext is in the menu .
84674	0	a	You you have different menu .
84675	0	a	Yeah , false .
84676	0	a	And volume is impo
84677	0	a	yeah .
84678	0	a	Volume is true .
84679	0	a	Big and clear ?
84680	0	a	Hey .
84681	0	a	Yeah , the they are big and clear .
84682	0	a	Yeah yeah , big and clear .
84683	0	a	Yeah , big and clear .
84684	1	a	But you could make a teletext button six .
84685	0	a	Otherwise , the people who read this are going to think we have no teletext button .
84686	0	a	Hey .
84687	0	a	Hide .
84688	0	a	Yeah ,
84689	0	a	but but the teletext button .
84690	0	a	Yeah , you can ch
84691	0	a	That is in a menu .
84692	0	a	It is it is not
84693	0	a	yeah ,
84694	0	a	it
84695	0	a	J
84696	0	a	Five ?
84697	0	a	Okay .
84698	0	a	So , it is w
84699	0	a	yeah ,
84700	0	a	it it
84701	0	a	it
84702	0	a	it is not entirely unclear ,
84703	0	a	but
84704	0	a	So , I would not give it a seven .
84705	0	a	I would give it a more a five or a six .
84706	0	a	No .
84707	0	a	Yeah .
84708	0	a	, I don I do not know .
84709	0	a	What do you think , Mister Project Manager ?
84710	0	a	Yeah ,
84711	0	a	it is it is
84712	0	a	yeah .
84713	0	a	Oh , okay .
84714	0	a	Well , I agree .
84715	0	a	I was thinking very black and white .
84716	0	a	Yeah .
84717	0	a	Black and red .
84718	0	a	Thank you J .
84719	0	a	Red .
84720	1	a	Okay , do not forget to save it .
84721	0	a	Okay .
84722	0	a	Volume .
84723	0	a	well , when we put in fancy colours , yeah
84724	0	a	and
84725	0	a	Yeah .
84726	0	a	The remote control is easy to be found .
84727	0	a	Yeah , it has these all these fruity colours and it has a strange shape .
84728	0	a	Fruity .
84729	0	a	So , if you so if you have trouble finding it
84730	0	a	Well , then then I will go for four .
84731	0	a	But , it it is not making any sound ,
84732	0	a	have we deciding ?
84733	0	a	So
84734	0	a	It will make a difference .
84735	0	a	Oh , okay ,
84736	0	a	but
84737	0	a	If you put your normal remote control under your bed , or you throw this remote control under your bed , is it better findable ?
84738	0	a	A li little bit maybe ?
84739	0	a	Four ?
84740	0	a	Fi I
84741	0	a	, I I
84742	0	a	I think five .
84743	0	a	We have the better re I do not know .
84744	0	a	Yeah , I think so .
84745	0	a	My remote control is black .
84746	0	a	A little bit ,
84747	0	a	but yeah .
84748	0	a	Yeah .
84749	1	a	Well , we p we can do it glow in the dark .
84750	0	a	K yeah .
84751	0	a	So , if it is in the dark place , you still see it glowing .
84752	0	a	Fo fo
84753	0	a	yeah
84754	0	a	fo five is .
84755	0	a	It is it is it does not really make a lot of
84756	0	a	Four ?
84757	0	a	Yes , but five is between four and six .
84758	0	a	Because four is between three and also between between true and false .
84759	0	a	Yeah , okay , you are right .
84760	0	a	so I will I will go for four .
84761	0	a	I think , you must see it as
84762	0	a	, w according to the the other remote controls , there may be there in your TV room , this one will stand out , I think .
84763	0	a	Wha
84764	0	a	Yeah , that that is a better question actually .
84765	0	a	Yeah .
84766	0	a	B .
84767	0	a	Yeah .
84768	0	a	Yeah .
84769	0	a	Yeah ,
84770	0	a	it it is
84771	0	a	Yeah ,
84772	0	a	yeah .
84773	0	a	Yeah .
84774	0	a	Exa
84775	0	a	I think that that is what it is about .
84776	0	a	If your fifteen remotes in a drawer , you find it , yeah ?
84777	0	a	Yeah , that is stupid .
84778	0	a	If it
84779	0	a	if this lying on your couch , you are
84780	0	a	you are
84781	0	a	you think what is that for kind of orange thing .
84782	0	a	But but the survey under users was that they really lost it .
84783	0	a	So
84784	0	a	Yeah .
84785	0	a	Like , no not not seeing it , but lost it in the house or something .
84786	0	a	Okay .
84787	0	a	, but when you lost it you are just not
84788	0	a	Yeah , mostly when you lose your remote control , it it is under your
84789	0	a	Most of times when you lose it you are sitting on it .
84790	0	a	But , okay .
84791	0	a	Well , if i if you see a strange shape lying somewhere , then you would recognise it as , whoa , that is strange .
84792	0	a	That is our remote control .
84793	0	a	Yeah , okay .
84794	0	a	Yeah .
84795	0	a	Yeah , what is that .
84796	0	a	Yeah , I
84797	0	a	I agree , I agree .
84798	0	a	so it is
84799	0	a	Yeah .
84800	0	a	Okay .
84801	0	a	Eight ,
84802	0	a	the remote control has fresh , fruity colours .
84803	0	a	I would call choose two ,
84804	0	a	cause we decided not to make two f fresh colours , as it would not .
84805	0	a	True .
84806	0	a	Yeah , yeah , not too flashy .
84807	0	a	The remote control is made of soft material .
84808	0	a	kind of soft , but but not this .
84809	0	a	Yeah , rubber , is kind of soft .
84810	0	a	Yeah , but not too soft we have decided .
84811	0	a	Three ?
84812	0	a	Easy to use ?
84813	0	a	Top easy to use ?
84814	0	a	It is it is not the most easy to use It can be easier .
84815	0	a	Yeah .
84816	0	a	Three , yeah .
84817	0	a	Yeah .
84818	0	a	Yeah yeah , easy to use ,
84819	0	a	very afford .
84820	0	a	Easy to use .
84821	0	a	One .
84822	0	a	Yeah , can it be zero ?
84823	0	a	Yeah .
84824	0	a	Well , I don
84825	0	a	yeah ,
84826	0	a	it is kind of It
84827	0	a	No .
84828	0	a	No , you can do two , because it can be easier .
84829	0	a	It could
84830	0	a	yeah .
84831	0	a	Jus just with ten buttons , that is the easiest .
84832	0	a	But then you are l
84833	0	a	yeah ,
84834	0	a	but then you will lose function
84835	0	a	f
84836	0	a	yeah , functionality and our fancy look , so .
84837	0	a	Functional ability .
84838	0	a	Yeah , but the most easy to use is just with one button
84839	0	a	on t
84840	0	a	Yeah , okay , but easy n not not the most easy to use , I think .
84841	0	a	But
84842	0	a	It is r it is rather easy to use , because you have the primary buttons always visible .
84843	0	a	No , it is it
84844	0	a	I
84845	0	a	I will go for two .
84846	0	a	No .
84847	0	a	My vote is on two .
84848	0	a	Two ?
84849	1	a	We also have to compare it to the to the remote controls on the market nowadays .
84850	0	a	Yeah , m mine too .
84851	0	a	Okay , two .
84852	0	a	Yeah , two .
84853	1	a	So
84854	0	a	Yeah yeah ,
84855	1	a	I am hurrying .
84856	1	a	Yeah , but waits just a minutes .
84857	0	a	Inspiration .
84858	0	a	What is the time ?
84859	1	a	We also have to do the evaluation , the production costs and stuff .
84860	0	a	These are the m regular remotes .
84861	0	a	Okay , eleven .
84862	0	a	The remote control is innovative .
84863	0	a	Yeah .
84864	0	a	Yes , true , one .
84865	0	a	Yes .
84866	0	a	A very

84869	0	a	You have not seen a more innovative thing in Paris ?
84870	0	a	False .
84871	0	a	The remote control has m remova removable from Multilux .
84872	0	a	Yes , one .
84873	0	a	Very multifunctional .
84874	0	a	No .
84875	0	a	The remote control , i it has speech recognition .

84877	0	a	Yes ,
84878	0	a	it
84879	0	a	Yeah , they are built in .
84880	0	a	This is used with speech recognition , this .
84881	0	a	The remote control has built in games ?
84882	0	a	Yeah .
84883	0	a	Yes .
84884	0	a	But , maybe make it two , because the games are in a sub menu and not it is not an entire game .
84885	0	a	Yeah , but they are built in , so it is one .
84886	0	a	Yeah , okay .
84887	0	a	Not down .

84905	0	a	We will see .
84906	0	a	If they are under twelve fifty .
84907	1	a	Okay , we have now to c to calculate the production cost .
84908	0	a	If it is under twelve and half Euro , then it is ok okay .
84909	0	a	But i is it if it is b
84910	0	a	Huh ?
84911	0	a	No , this is not right .

84922	0	a	sorry .
84923	1	a	Yeah , if the costs are under twelve and a half Euro , then we can ra move on to the project evaluation , as we have experienced it .
84924	1	a	Otherwise , we have do have to do a little redesign thingy .
84925	1	a	So , we have to fill in the numbers of the component components .
84926	1	a	We have to fil , want to do it in and see if we stay under the twelve and a half Euro .
84927	0	a	So , do we have a hand dynamo ?

85074	1	a	, can I
85075	1	a	I say something ?
85076	1	a	No , can I say something as Project Manager ?
85077	1	a	The kinetic thing , can we just skip it ,
85078	0	a	because you have to shake it , but that is not really innovative .
85079	0	a	No .
85080	0	a	Yeah .
85081	1	a	, single curves .
85082	0	a	Yeah , of course .

85102	0	a	Yeah ,
85103	0	a	yeah ,
85104	0	a	okay .
85105	0	a	Yeah .
85106	0	a	Okay .
85107	0	a	But you can use rechargeable batteries anyway , just you s you have to recharge them manual .
85108	0	a	Yeah , and not really .
85109	0	a	But we
85110	0	a	if you forget about the kinetic , well if we do that , we shall .
85111	0	a	Just an idea .
85112	0	a	Yeah ,
85113	0	a	that is a cost reduc .
85114	0	a	Yeah , sure .
85115	0	a	Yeah .
85116	0	a	Okay ,
85117	1	a	well you you can go from double curved to single curved .
85118	0	a	So
85119	0	a	, b but i but the single curved is just oh
85120	0	a	Oh , okay , okay .
85121	0	a	Yeah , of course .
85122	0	a	And that would solve the budget problem .
85123	0	a	Yeah ,
85124	1	a	so we have to bake the ba back flat , and then
85125	0	a	No , it is it is just one curve and not a back curved I think .
85126	0	a	Yeah .
85127	0	a	It is just yeah
85128	0	a	well , the single curve that
85129	0	a	Yeah .
85130	0	a	Or
85131	0	a	Or are these two curves ?
85132	0	a	Yeah ,
85133	1	a	but what else do we have to cut out ?
85134	0	a	No advanced chip , that is a little bit of problem .
85135	0	a	Exactly , yeah .
85136	0	a	So that is wh tha that is one option .
85137	0	a	Yeah .
85138	0	a	And then w yeah ,
85139	0	a	and then we could have it , but it is its'
85140	0	a	well it is it is
85141	0	a	r it is the main point of the the the the look .
85142	0	a	Yeah ,
85143	0	a	Yeah .
85144	0	a	We going to cut
85145	0	a	Yeah , we just make it flat .
85146	0	a	No , tho that that can be done .
85147	0	a	So ,
85148	1	a	okay , a little less conversation .
85149	0	a	Although , can we make it with a regular chip ?
85150	0	a	Curvy .
85151	0	a	Hey , those ar arcs , why are there for ?
85152	0	a	The blue blue
85153	0	a	Okay .
85154	0	a	Sorry ?
85155	0	a	Fill in
85156	0	a	Just a
85157	0	a	explanation .
85158	0	a	Explanation .
85159	0	a	Twelve fifty .
85160	1	a	I can delete it for you if you want .
85161	0	a	Well
85162	0	a	Yeah ,
85163	0	a	but does it fit with our design ?
85164	1	a	Do we have to u adapt it ?
85165	0	a	It is single curves .
85166	0	a	No , no no .
85167	0	a	So , if we do this , we are on twelve and a half Euro .
85168	0	a	And we are done .
85169	0	a	well , the only thing that do not
85170	0	a	Yeah , single curved , but there is a curve in it .
85171	0	a	Yeah .
85172	0	a	W
85173	1	a	Could we just make the bubbles cut off the back , and then we are has
85174	0	a	Okay .
85175	0	a	So Yeah , it is really a static value .
85176	0	a	But , wha Kay , look , what is the
85177	0	a	If you make it double curved , it costs one Euro more .
85178	0	a	But , you do l
85179	0	a	Function .
85180	0	a	More .
85181	0	a	Yeah .
85182	0	a	But
85183	0	a	No ,
85184	0	a	but does it have a lot of extra fun function more like
85185	0	a	Yeah .
85186	1	a	You make it optional .
85187	0	a	Functional .
85188	0	a	Worth , does it have added worth ?
85189	0	a	No ,
85190	0	a	Yeah , well let is assume it is .
85191	0	a	, there is an a a athe aesthetic value , but not functionality .
85192	0	a	Yeah , aesthetic .
85193	0	a	Yeah .
85194	0	a	I mean , you make like eleven and a half Euros profit instead of twelve and a half .
85195	0	a	But I do not know if twelve and a half is a fixed fixed price .
85196	0	a	Yeah , it is .
85197	0	a	No , we ca not go above that .
85198	0	a	Yeah ?
85199	0	a	Yeah , okay .
85200	0	a	Oh .
85201	0	a	We we should assume it i that it is .
85202	0	a	Yeah , okay .
85203	0	a	Yeah .
85204	0	a	But I I figured that the kinetic would be a marketing promotion .
85205	0	a	Then it is okay .
85206	0	a	R if you promote a kinetic
85207	0	a	I kinetic remote control ,
85208	0	a	I mean , that would b sell better than an a normal remote control .
85209	0	a	Yeah .
85210	0	a	Yeah .
85211	0	a	Do you think ?
85212	0	a	Well , now you can shake your remote control .
85213	0	a	Yeah , I think so .
85214	0	a	No , well , y I mean , y you can go into your neighbour and tell him , ha , my k remote control is kinetic .
85215	0	a	Kinetic .
85216	0	a	You have standard old battery control remote con True .
85217	0	a	Yeah .
85218	0	a	Yeah .
85219	0	a	What a what about all the m the environment freaks ?
85220	0	a	Not freaks ,
85221	0	a	the envi
85222	0	a	No .
85223	0	a	Yeah .
85224	0	a	Yeah , but it does not fit in our co cost profile .
85225	0	a	So
85226	1	a	You ma can make an an especialised extra gold version .
85227	0	a	I I think it is
85228	0	a	it is
85229	0	a	It look like this one .
85230	0	a	Yeah ?
85231	0	a	Who
85232	0	a	because if you want to go to kinetic , you are you are on thirteen and a half
85233	0	a	and you must go to flat , and I think now it is it is more of a compromise thing .
85234	0	a	Yeah .
85235	0	a	Yeah .
85236	1	a	And if you make the single curve ha just a big curve ,
85237	0	a	then it is then it is
85238	0	a	yeah , one big good curve .
85239	0	a	Yeah , just one big curve .
85240	0	a	I was going to say nasty words , but I do not .
85241	0	a	This is strange by the way .
85242	0	a	Wood is m is is is cheaper than rubber .
85243	0	a	We thought that wood would be more expensive .
85244	0	a	Yeah .
85245	0	a	, this American figures .
85246	0	a	You just cut down some trees .
85247	0	a	Yeah , maybe .
85248	0	a	But that
85249	0	a	this is this is it ?
85250	0	a	Yeah .
85251	0	a	This is it .
85252	0	a	Okay , this is it .
85253	0	a	Whoever makes a remote control out of titanium .
85254	1	a	I am going to save it .
85255	0	a	Yeah .
85256	0	a	Yes .
85257	0	a	It is possible , but you ca not use double curves for titanium .
85258	0	a	No .
85259	0	a	That is one of the functionability
85260	0	a	Well , I th
85261	0	a	I think you two , especially you and and Daniel , you d you
85262	0	a	you both had the less creative roles in the project .
85263	0	a	Okay , well ,
85264	0	a	considering we have
85265	0	a	Well , we were above , so we did a little redesign
85266	0	a	Okay ,
85267	0	a	now it is about time to talk about this project .
85268	0	a	no , we have to do all those hours again .
85269	1	a	Go back .
85270	1	a	One back ?
85271	0	a	Costs on No redesign .
85272	0	a	Yeah .
85273	0	a	We sue .
85274	0	a	Yeah ,
85275	0	a	okay ,
85276	0	a	yeah .
85277	0	a	We
85278	0	a	Yeah , we will start her all o all over again .
85279	0	a	, some things .
85280	0	a	Were there room for
85281	0	a	was there room for creativity in our meetings or in your individual meetings ?
85282	0	a	Yeah .
85283	0	a	For us , there was a lot of creativity .
85284	0	a	I I did not think so .
85285	0	a	That there was a lot of room for it .
85286	0	a	But , that is mainly because of the information that was delivered to us .
85287	0	a	It was just fixed information and get your stuff from there , and I could not go on on i on the internet and search my own stuff .
85288	0	a	Yeah .
85289	0	a	Yeah ,
85290	0	a	yeah ,
85291	0	a	yeah .
85292	0	a	Bu
85293	0	a	Yeah .
85294	0	a	That is true .
85295	0	a	I agree with that .
85296	0	a	Yeah .
85297	0	a	That is true .
85298	0	a	Cause I think m
85299	0	a	I think Jeroen and I , we had a more design we could have more we had more room for creativity than than you two .
85300	0	a	We could just sign up an remote if we liked .
85301	0	a	Yeah .
85302	0	a	Yeah .
85303	0	a	Yeah , that is true .
85304	0	a	Yeah .
85305	0	a	Yeah .
85306	0	a	Yeah , that is true .
85307	0	a	Okay .
85308	0	a	how about the leadership ?
85309	0	a	Okay , thank you very much .
85310	0	a	Crappy .
85311	0	a	Leadership was crappy .
85312	0	a	Ha .
85313	0	a	Nah , the leadership was not crappy , it was the leader that was crappy .
85314	0	a	Cra Yeah .
85315	0	a	Nah .
85316	0	a	Okay .
85317	0	a	No , the leadership was okay .
85318	0	a	Now we are done .
85319	0	a	Yeah , example of crappy leadershi
85320	0	a	Okay , yeah .
85321	0	a	No , leadership was
85322	0	a	Okay , I thought the first meeting was a little bit of unstructured meeting .
85323	0	a	Yeah , it was good .
85324	0	a	Yeah , that is true .
85325	0	a	, you could have
85326	0	a	but , it was your first ,
85327	0	a	no no disrespect or something ,
85328	0	a	but you could have structure it a l little bit more .
85329	0	a	So like , I I was talking most of the time the first meeting meeting , and
85330	0	a	Yeah .
85331	0	a	Yeah .
85332	0	a	You could of said , shut up you fool .
85333	0	a	Yeah .
85334	0	a	Yeah .
85335	0	a	But
85336	0	a	About me .
85337	0	a	I notice it too .
85338	0	a	I was a
85339	0	a	I was also very unhappy , very unsatisfied about the about the first meeting .
85340	0	a	So , I hope the the the other meetings get better and I think the the last two meetings also we we reached some good decisions about talk
85341	0	a	yeah .
85342	0	a	Yeah , you made up .
85343	0	a	Try to learn from your mistake .
85344	0	a	And we will never do it again .
85345	0	a	No , it you did better .
85346	0	a	Yeah , more more consensus .
85347	0	a	Yeah .
85348	0	a	Ev everybody w was agreeing every Yeah .
85349	0	a	Much more constructive .
85350	0	a	Okay , so that is cool .
85351	0	a	, teamwork ?
85352	0	a	Well , maybe that is only
85353	0	a	Yeah well , it is for us , because
85354	0	a	Yeah .
85355	0	a	Well , we work together on a project , but everybody has his own task .
85356	0	a	Yeah and it is wo more like presentation and some points were discussed .
85357	0	a	So , it is a little bit
85358	0	a	Yeah .
85359	0	a	But , really teamwork were you two
85360	0	a	The
85361	0	a	Yeah ?
85362	0	a	No hard feelings .
85363	0	a	No
85364	0	a	Well , it went okay .
85365	0	a	Two guys .
85366	0	a	Yeah , that went w
85367	0	a	it went well .
85368	0	a	It is it is just
85369	0	a	Nah .
85370	0	a	Stupid stupid pen , but
85371	0	a	Yeah ,
85372	1	a	but but draw something difficult .
85373	0	a	Yeah , we we had some trouble with the pen , but
85374	0	a	Yeah , but us
85375	0	a	Yeah .
85376	0	a	Yeah .
85377	0	a	Now you you must push a little while .
85378	1	a	D just write your name right now .
85379	1	a	Try to write your name , in in writing letters , of course , yeah ?
85380	0	a	Yeah , normally , this
85381	1	a	the w Block letter sign it ,
85382	1	a	yeah ?
85383	1	a	Just just write your name in in one line .
85384	1	a	Okay .
85385	0	a	O Just
85386	1	a	okay .
85387	0	a	If it is a little bit too small
85388	1	a	bit quicker now .
85389	0	a	It did not
85390	0	a	he he knows how it works , yeah .
85391	0	a	You can be you can go quicker , cause then it it wo not notice it .
85392	0	a	I follow the Master class for the SMARTboard , so I think that is the that is the main issue .
85393	0	a	Oh .
85394	0	a	Okay .
85395	0	a	, so about this one you were you are dealing with ,
85396	0	a	the the the the digital pen .
85397	0	a	Means .
85398	0	a	Y well , yeah .
85399	0	a	Th the i
85400	0	a	The idea is great , but it does not work properly .
85401	0	a	Okay .
85402	0	a	Digital pen , I thought th the first time I did individual work , I used it .
85403	0	a	Yeah .
85404	0	a	Yeah .
85405	0	a	Yeah .
85406	0	a	But , a and the first two meetings I brought it with me , but I did not use it at all after the first the first meeting .
85407	0	a	No .
85408	0	a	No , I have it working .
85409	0	a	But , yeah , well
85410	0	a	No , it does not have that much added value to the Yeah .
85411	0	a	It is it is not real real use for me .
85412	0	a	Huh .
85413	0	a	Nee .
85414	0	a	Well
85415	0	a	Yeah .
85416	0	a	As as I said a m a c few moments ago , it I would like , myself , to write with a normal pen ,
85417	0	a	because must Yeah , it is almost the same concept , but you can just sim more simply put it on our scanner .
85418	0	a	I it is the same concept as the pen , where you f have to download the software or s very slow .
85419	0	a	M yeah .
85420	0	a	Yeah .
85421	0	a	And it is still your own handwriting popping up in Word .
85422	0	a	Yes .
85423	0	a	No , and it does not give any added value .
85424	0	a	No , that is true .
85425	0	a	Not really , no .
85426	0	a	No .
85427	0	a	And the SMARTboard is useful , but the the pen is I not user friendly , I think .
85428	0	a	Yeah , not user friendly .
85429	0	a	Be it it takes a lot of time to draw things and to write things ,
85430	0	a	and that is the
85431	0	a	Yeah , but that is not th the the you
85432	0	a	when you at a foreign audience , you b do not going to wr write small .
85433	0	a	Yeah , and it is it is not very precise .
85434	0	a	We are trying to m to
85435	0	a	Yeah , it may
85436	1	a	Yeah , and tr try to wri write your name in a in a normal size ,
85437	1	a	yeah .
85438	0	a	Yeah ,
85439	0	a	like when you do this .
85440	1	a	Smaller .
85441	1	a	Smaller ?
85442	0	a	Oh .
85443	1	a	Yeah , smaller .
85444	0	a	Just like when you are writing on a letter .
85445	0	a	No ,
85446	1	a	a as you saw on on this drawing , just open open this one or that one .
85447	0	a	It is th it it
85448	0	a	Yeah , we had more problems even here when we trying to draw these buttons , it is almost impossible to get clear when you are
85449	0	a	And the eraser was another problem .
85450	0	a	Yeah .
85451	0	a	Sorry .
85452	0	a	But maybe there is some function with
85453	0	a	no , it is not .
85454	0	a	With
85455	0	a	Yeah .
85456	0	a	It w t is is this large .
85457	0	a	And when you try to erase this line , y
85458	1	a	I am going to erase my name there .
85459	1	a	Well , I am going to erase my name .
85460	0	a	Yeah , it is a big big eraser .
85461	0	a	Okay .
85462	0	a	New ideas ?
85463	0	a	Do you ?
85464	1	a	Go on .
85465	0	a	M Abo
85466	0	a	What kind of new ideas ?
85467	0	a	Yeah ,
85468	0	a	New ideas about the working of this software , about about the project , about the remote controls or
85469	0	a	Hello .
85470	0	a	Well , the the idea of the touch screen is
85471	0	a	I am just
85472	0	a	I do not know what what I mean .
85473	0	a	Yeah .
85474	0	a	, yeah , I think so .
85475	0	a	Did you heard what he said ?
85476	0	a	I do not
85477	0	a	I do not know what I mean .
85478	0	a	No .
85479	0	a	Know what I mean .
85480	0	a	Oh , I have some figure .
85481	0	a	Here .
85482	0	a	The eva the evaluation , the the mean number is one point eight one point eight six .
85483	0	a	Oh .
85484	0	a	Oh yeah .
85485	0	a	That is interesting .
85486	0	a	So that is fairly fairly good , I think .
85487	0	a	Okay ,
85488	0	a	because what does it mean ?
85489	0	a	All the mo
85490	0	a	yeah , are between one and two .
85491	0	a	Yeah .
85492	0	a	So true .
85493	0	a	, that
85494	0	a	all the requirements are true or very true , right .
85495	0	a	Yeah .
85496	0	a	Oh , okay .
85497	0	a	Yep .
85498	0	a	Yeah , okay .
85499	0	a	Thank you , expert .
85500	0	a	But the new ideas found for wi with working with this software ?
85501	0	a	Not really , yeah ?
85502	0	a	Yeah , I think
85503	0	a	Yeah .
85504	0	a	Not really , just they have to improve it .
85505	0	a	, the concept is okay , but it has to be quicker .
85506	0	a	, it is still opening my programme , n almo almost my entire computer is locked up during the process
85507	0	a	and it , yeah , just takes too many time .
85508	0	a	People will still feel the need to to write it quickly on a page and not download it and save it , and More user friendly .
85509	0	a	Yeah .
85510	0	a	You had expected it to to be more more
85511	0	a	Yeah .
85512	0	a	Cause when you use a pen , you can just draw like you d draw normally ,
85513	0	a	and you do
85514	0	a	Yeah .
85515	0	a	Yeah .
85516	0	a	Yeah .
85517	0	a	May maybe the idea you proposed is a screen here .
85518	0	a	And draw it , and it is it is placed over there .
85519	0	a	Yeah .
85520	0	a	Yeah , that l
85521	0	a	Would be easier .
85522	0	a	Yeah .
85523	0	a	Or at least when you you do not have to adapt to the technology , just you can write in the way you normally write .
85524	0	a	No .
85525	0	a	And now you have to keep constantly in mind that you are drawing on this screen .
85526	0	a	And that is a very bad concept .
85527	0	a	Yep , yep .
85528	0	a	Yeah , that is true .
85529	0	a	, very bad .
85530	0	a	Nah , okay ,
85531	0	a	I I
85532	0	a	it is my opinion
85533	0	a	that I
85534	0	a	Yeah , it is can be saved easier .
85535	0	a	But
85536	0	a	I think this is better than regular flip overs ,
85537	0	a	but
85538	0	a	Yeah .
85539	0	a	But if you are in normal flip over you a lot of people write text .
85540	0	a	There is no text option .
85541	0	a	Yeah .
85542	0	a	And writing text , yeah , you have gotta really do your best to write some
85543	0	a	Yeah .
85544	0	a	Yeah ,
85545	0	a	and and maybe some functions for circle or a square .
85546	0	a	You have to draw it yourself now .
85547	0	a	Or maybe even insert picture .
85548	0	a	Yeah .
85549	0	a	If you have some presentation , and you have some f
85550	0	a	Yeah .
85551	0	a	Yeah .
85552	0	a	Or text function .
85553	0	a	Just t t type text , and that that would be excellent .
85554	0	a	Mean
85555	0	a	Oh .
85556	0	a	Yeah .
85557	0	a	Yeah ,
85558	0	a	but insert image is not available ?
85559	0	a	Here .
85560	0	a	Cause then you could
85561	0	a	Oh , okay .
85562	0	a	Picture from scanner , clip art .
85563	0	a	Yeah , that that can be done already .
85564	0	a	But not the the the the predefined squares I think
85565	0	a	Sorry ?
85566	0	a	Well , that is nice .
85567	0	a	So you can
85568	1	a	With WW dot Google dot com .
85569	0	a	Hyperlink ?
85570	1	a	Hey , what if you do like hyperlink ?
85571	1	a	Type type it ?
85572	1	a	Re Real Reaction dot NL .
85573	0	a	Oh yeah .
85574	0	a	Maybe .
85575	0	a	Yes , is now is okay .
85576	0	a	Okay ?
85577	0	a	Huh .
85578	1	a	You will just make a link in
85579	0	a	Yeah .
85580	0	a	There is one way to
85581	1	a	Maybe if if you are not using the eraser
85582	0	a	Something else th
85583	0	a	Yeah , arrow .
85584	0	a	Is it
85585	0	a	Here .
85586	1	a	Kay , double click it .
85587	0	a	oh .
85588	0	a	You are erasing .
85589	0	a	Oh , sorry .
85590	1	a	Double click it .
85591	0	a	Yeah .
85592	0	a	Here , that .
85593	0	a	Okay .
85594	0	a	Well , it is
85595	0	a	Yeah , okay .
85596	0	a	So you have
85597	0	a	as you saw , you have a little
85598	0	a	Oh , you can
85599	0	a	Yeah ,
85600	0	a	thank you .
85601	0	a	You can go there .
85602	0	a	So there the the the functionality is there ,
85603	0	a	but it is not it is not ideal ,
85604	0	a	and it is it is very
85605	0	a	it costs a lot of time to
85606	0	a	to use .
85607	0	a	But .
85608	0	a	To use , yeah .
85609	0	a	Yeah .
85610	0	a	And that is a pity ,
85611	0	a	if you if you have thirty , forty minutes for this kind of things , and we are now with four people ,
85612	0	a	but it
85613	0	a	well , imagine you are here you are with the ten people and everyone
85614	0	a	Yeah .
85615	0	a	Yeah .
85616	0	a	And that is m
85617	0	a	That is mostly the case ,
85618	0	a	from the over here with the managements you get two minutes to make your case , and if you have to do all this kind
85619	0	a	You will rather use PowerPoint and work it out in advance .
85620	0	a	Two minutes of drawing , yeah .
85621	0	a	Yep .
85622	0	a	Yeah .
85623	0	a	And th the one or two things you have to draw when you are there , just use a flip board .
85624	0	a	Yeah .
85625	0	a	What I really miss also is
85626	0	a	is a d is a turtle
85627	0	a	is a decision decision system
85628	0	a	like With the evaluation , you have to Polls like , what do you want , a one , a two ,
85629	0	a	maybe a a l a little application like give your own number and click one two three four five six seven .
85630	0	a	Yeah yeah .
85631	0	a	Yeah .
85632	0	a	Yeah , just like he said with the with the a screen which you can write , also a kind of voting mechanism .
85633	0	a	Yeah , j ju ju yeah , v voting application .
85634	0	a	Just a little group group decision application .
85635	0	a	Yeah .
85636	0	a	Yeah .
85637	0	a	But , problem is , well you ca not discuss anything well you
85638	0	a	you ca you can ,
85639	0	a	but you will discuss a lot less than l like we did now .
85640	0	a	Yeah .
85641	0	a	We I mean w w
85642	0	a	w one one person
85643	0	a	s maybe said three .
85644	0	a	But , well I we said , no I w th think two , because this and this , and then you can react on it .
85645	0	a	But if you you put a three on it , just figure well
85646	0	a	, everybody knows what I am knowing , so they will all just put a two on .
85647	0	a	Yeah , okay .
85648	0	a	Yeah , of course .
85649	0	a	But , you can still discuss about it , but but click it in an application , that is a lot easier to process .
85650	0	a	Yeah , but it would
85651	0	a	yeah .
85652	0	a	Yeah okay , the for processing part .
85653	0	a	The digit .
85654	0	a	Yeah .
85655	0	a	But then , I think the idea of one person entering it and the rest discussing it , that is not that bad idea , actually .
85656	0	a	Yeah .
85657	0	a	Not that your opinion is not valued , but but still .
85658	0	a	Yeah .
85659	0	a	Yeah .
85660	0	a	Okay .
85661	0	a	Okay .
85662	0	a	Okay , so
85663	0	a	well , just about ,
85664	0	a	because
85665	0	a	Yeah , tomorrow ?
85666	0	a	, the costs are within the budget .
85667	0	a	Yo , manager .

85673	0	a	, the project is evaluated .
85674	0	a	Yeah .
85675	0	a	Yeah .
85676	1	a	But , before we going to celebrate , I have a little question which you ca not answer ,
85677	0	a	because there must be some kind of end report .

85720	0	a	But it is not fully finished yet .
85721	0	a	Five minutes for finishing .
85722	0	a	, this is about the functional design ,
85723	0	a	the things
85724	0	a	yeah
85725	0	a	yeah .
85726	1	a	Management Expert , you have to change that .

85734	0	a	Oh , okay .
85735	0	a	Marketing Expert ,
85736	0	a	okay .
85737	0	a	about the three functions where which are most used and which must immediately be visible on our remote control .
85738	0	a	, it must be simple to use , very clear what to do , and at the younger people .
85739	0	a	So , this is really about wh what kind things must be in it and
85740	0	a	yeah .
85741	0	a	Maybe the The
85742	0	a	Yeah .
85743	0	a	One two three .
85744	0	a	Yeah , I understand you , I can talk a little bit Dutch .
85745	0	a	You
85746	0	a	Yeah .
85747	1	a	No , you have to put , switch channels at the top , because that is the most used function and teletext at the second
85748	0	a	Oh nay ,
85749	0	a	a volume changing , second .
85750	0	a	Oka okay
85751	0	a	, okay ,
85752	0	a	I
85753	0	a	I really did not knew that .
85754	0	a	So , this one is first .
85755	0	a	S switch , yes .
85756	0	a	You go there and you go there .
85757	0	a	Yeah .
85758	0	a	So , okay .
85759	1	a	Okay , go on .

85761	0	a	one two three .
85762	0	a	Yes , very good .
85763	0	a	If the order is in is is important , that is the word for .
85764	0	a	Yeah .
85765	0	a	Yeah .
85766	0	a	The order .
85767	0	a	then the conceptual design .
85768	0	a	, well all the things we have discussed , the energy , which turn out to be batteries ,
85769	0	a	so that is
85770	0	a	Yeah ,
85771	0	a	because yeah .
85772	0	a	Yeah .
85773	1	a	Well , okay , maybe you can add it later that we decided in the end because of the cost .
85774	0	a	, he here it is still double curve , the rubber , the flashy , the fruity , the removable .
85775	0	a	Single curves .
85776	0	a	, the buttons
85777	0	a	Not double anymore .
85778	0	a	, it is not double anymore , eh ?
85779	0	a	Yeah
85780	0	a	, okay .
85781	0	a	A single curved .
85782	0	a	No , okay .
85783	0	a	Nay but that this is what
85784	0	a	Yeah .
85785	0	a	Was initial , the plan .
85786	0	a	Yeah .
85787	0	a	The initial plan .
85788	0	a	And the the added functions like Tetris snake , it is under the parental control , the touch screen .
85789	1	a	On thing One small thing ,
85790	0	a	the added functions .
85791	0	a	So , it is just a summary of what we had discussed
85792	0	a	, it is very cheap ,
85793	0	a	you
85794	0	a	you maybe
85795	0	a	you
85796	0	a	you you
85797	0	a	you come at
85798	0	a	It is very necessary .
85799	0	a	, was it included in the cost ?
85800	0	a	I do not think so , eh ?
85801	0	a	It is very cheap .
85802	0	a	, it is very cheap .
85803	0	a	No , it is it is not very cheap , but that no , but it is a development inside corporation .
85804	0	a	Like , w we do not have to buy parental control .
85805	0	a	Our own people can make that , I think .
85806	0	a	Yeah , but it still has some
85807	0	a	yeah .
85808	0	a	Yeah .
85809	0	a	Yeah , it it has some cost , but
85810	0	a	Yeah .
85811	0	a	Okay ,
85812	0	a	but so we can discuss that
85813	1	a	we can discuss that kind of things I think with the with the the board of
85814	0	a	What is it what is the company called ?
85815	0	a	I just keep forgetting it .
85816	0	a	He will do it in his free time .
85817	0	a	So
85818	1	a	Of directur or directors .
85819	0	a	Real Reaction .
85820	0	a	Real Real Reaction .
85821	0	a	Yeah .
85822	0	a	Real Reaction , yeah .
85823	0	a	You can ask your personal
85824	0	a	Yeah , the end conclusion .
85825	0	a	Okay , so anybody misses something here about
85826	0	a	Yeah , okay ,
85827	1	a	that is that is what I am going to write b between now .
85828	0	a	But
85829	0	a	, the decision to make the buttons on the top , and the menu on the on the bottom .
85830	0	a	Okay .
85831	0	a	Still the end conclusion .
85832	0	a	That is all , I think .
85833	0	a	But , i in here nothing
85834	0	a	And clearly
85835	0	a	Yeah , touch screen you have mentioned .
85836	0	a	Yes .
85837	0	a	Yeah , touch screen I have mentioned .
85838	0	a	Yeah ,
85839	0	a	but but the the decisions are put in the conclusion , I think .
85840	0	a	Okay .
85841	0	a	Why we decided to use a flat LCD .
85842	0	a	Okay , this n yeah .
85843	0	a	Yeah , okay ,

85846	0	a	No .
85847	0	a	Save it .
85848	0	a	Party party .
85849	0	a	Because I think it will
85850	0	a	Oh , five minutes from to finish meeting .
85851	1	a	Oh , before you change anything maybe you save it first .
85852	0	a	You ca not
85853	1	a	you can select file and export and then those J PEG files .
85854	0	a	Yeah , but then you had the same thing .

85936	0	a	So now we all know what our goal is .
85937	0	a	Okay .
85938	0	a	, I oh forget I forget the whole acquaintance part , but we we all know each other .
85939	0	a	We all know each other is names .
85940	0	a	Joost , Guido , Antek .
85941	0	a	Yes .
85942	0	a	What is your name ?
85943	0	a	Antek Ahmet .
85944	0	a	Yes .
85945	0	a	Antek .
85946	0	a	Okay .
85947	0	a	And Joost .
85948	0	a	I think we al already been through that part .
85949	0	a	Okay .
85950	0	a	Yeah .
85951	0	a	Okay , it consists of three levels of design .
85952	0	a	we begin with the functional design , then we go to the conceptual design and the detailed design .
85953	0	a	Every level of design consists of some individual work , and we close it with a meeting .
85954	0	a	You all received an email with a example of our explanation of what the particular level of design means to the different functions , and you p you probably read that already , so I do not have to tell you about that .
85955	0	a	Yes .
85956	0	a	Yes .
85957	0	a	Okay , first we are going to going to try some different things with the tools we have over here , so you get acquainted with these meeting tools .
85958	0	a	We have the smart boards , the thes those two boards .
85959	0	a	This is the presentation boards , wh which one I am using right now .
85960	0	a	You can
85961	0	a	there is a document folder called the sh shared document folder .
85962	0	a	You can upload your documents to that folder and then you can open them over here , so you can do your PowerPoint presentations on this screen .
85963	0	a	We also have the white board .
85964	0	a	, we are going to skip through th
85965	0	a	No , no .
85966	0	a	Can we see the white board on our laptops ?
85967	0	a	No , I saw I saw the file , the smart board that XBK but
85968	0	a	Okay .
85969	0	a	Just on the on the screen over there .
85970	0	a	Oh , no .
85971	0	a	Probably is , but I do not know if the software is on the laptop .
85972	0	a	Is is if
85973	0	a	it is mainly a thing for in the meeting , so I do not think it is
85974	0	a	I do not know if it is important .
85975	0	a	This an explanation of the smart boards .
85976	0	a	There is a tool bar over here .
85977	0	a	It is quite simple .
85978	0	a	You have the the pen function , eraser function .
85979	0	a	It is like a very simple paint application .
85980	0	a	, we well ,
85981	0	a	we use the same file during the whole day , and you can make new sheets by by pu puttin pressing on the blank button .
85982	0	a	It works like this .
85983	0	a	Oh .
85984	0	a	If pen is selected , yes .
85985	0	a	Oh , no no .
85986	0	a	With that pen ?
85987	0	a	It is not But it is pen .
85988	0	a	It is not working like a pen yet .
85989	0	a	Huh .
85990	0	a	Huh .
85991	0	a	It is doing some stuff now .
85992	0	a	Little bit slower .
85993	0	a	So you can use a pen .
85994	0	a	You can use an eraser .
85995	0	a	And you can make new fi new blanks , and you can change the line width and the colour of the pen by pressing on forward , which y you have to select pen format .
85996	0	a	And then select current colour or line width .
85997	0	a	So , it is quite easy .
85998	0	a	well , now you are all acquainted with the different tools .
85999	0	a	Right , we are going to try out the electronic white boards .
86000	0	a	, every participant should draw his favourite animal and some of its favourite characteristics , on blank sheets with different colours , with different pen widths .
86001	1	a	, I will start off then .
86002	1	a	I will use this same sheet .
86003	0	a	Alright .
86004	0	a	Oh , let me think .
86005	0	a	Different colours .
86006	0	a	Oh .
86007	1	a	Well , I am going to draw a p piranha .
86008	1	a	, a fish .
86009	0	a	piranha .
86010	0	a	Okay .
86011	0	a	Oh .
86012	1	a	I am going to use some different colour now .
86013	0	a	Some a little white .
86014	0	a	Looks like a fish .
86015	0	a	Think it is .
86016	0	a	Oh .
86017	0	a	Oh .
86018	0	a	, colour .
86019	0	a	This is black ?
86020	0	a	I think so .
86021	0	a	Yellow
86022	0	a	Oh .
86023	0	a	Oh , this is just useless drawings but
86024	0	a	Oh teeth .
86025	0	a	I need teeth .
86026	0	a	Well , they are not supposed to be green , or whatever colour this is .
86027	0	a	Okay .
86028	0	a	What was
86029	0	a	I have su to sum up its favourite characteris
86030	0	a	Well , I like its sharp razor sharp teeth .
86031	0	a	Different .
86032	0	a	Plus , the the big forehead and a small , well a small actual face .
86033	0	a	And I like its overall aggressive look
86034	0	a	and Well , that is what I like about piranha .
86035	0	a	Okay .
86036	0	a	I think that is kind of what the intention should be .
86037	1	a	Well , who wants to be next ?
86038	0	a	You go , Guido ?
86039	0	a	Okay .
86040	0	a	Nobody , I guess .
86041	1	a	I will try .
86042	1	a	Yeah .
86043	1	a	I will try .
86044	0	a	Blank ?
86045	0	a	Okay .
86046	1	a	, make a new sheet .
86047	0	a	, it is by pressing on blank .
86048	0	a	Yep .
86049	0	a	Then pen again ?
86050	0	a	Okay .
86051	0	a	Yep .
86052	0	a	And so in the format menu you can choose the different colours and pen widths .
86053	0	a	Okay ,
86054	0	a	control .
86055	0	a	Format .
86056	0	a	, purple .
86057	0	a	, I do not know what my favourite animal is , but the easiest animal I can think is is a bird .
86058	0	a	I will
86059	0	a	That is my bird .
86060	0	a	You know , I thought of that actually .
86061	0	a	Yeah ?
86062	0	a	Is not it quite
86063	0	a	it is a little bit light .
86064	0	a	Yeah .
86065	1	a	, another colour maybe .
86066	1	a	A red one .
86067	0	a	A small one .
86068	0	a	, line width .
86069	0	a	Two ?
86070	0	a	Three .
86071	0	a	Oh that is okay .
86072	0	a	That is another one .
86073	1	a	Well , tell us something about your favourite characteristics of these particular birds .
86074	0	a	Ano it is a
86075	0	a	Yeah , it is the most simple animal I know , I think .
86076	0	a	Its simplicity .
86077	0	a	, I do not know .
86078	0	a	Maybe because there is there is some s free maybe in the sky or something like that .
86079	0	a	Oh , okay .
86080	0	a	Okay .
86081	0	a	Maybe a little bit .
86082	0	a	Yeah .
86083	0	a	I do not know .
86084	0	a	Okay .
86085	0	a	No , it is clear .
86086	0	a	So more birds ?
86087	0	a	Okay , okay , okay .
86088	0	a	N no no .
86089	0	a	We get your point .
86090	1	a	Okay .
86091	1	a	Who wants to be next ?
86092	0	a	Oh .
86093	1	a	Yeah , whatever .
86094	1	a	I will go next .
86095	0	a	Thanks .

86112	0	a	Something like that .
86113	0	a	Come on .
86114	0	a	Yeah , it is little bit hard .
86115	0	a	, orange .
86116	0	a	Orange , of course .
86117	0	a	Whatever .
86118	0	a	Oh , it is better than your bird .
86119	0	a	yeah .
86120	0	a	Everything is better than your bird .
86121	0	a	Yeah .
86122	0	a	True .
86123	0	a	Whatever .
86124	0	a	Hey , it is blue .
86125	0	a	No .
86126	0	a	Whatever .
86127	0	a	, I like its ugliness
86128	0	a	and Yeah , whatever .
86129	0	a	The way it walks or whatever .
86130	0	a	Okay .
86131	1	a	Your turn .
86132	1	a	Kay .
86133	0	a	Drawing .
86134	1	a	I am going to draw a cat .
86135	0	a	I do not know why , but a cat is a very smart animal .
86136	0	a	And you can have them at home .
86137	0	a	Which is not as the case with with bingwings and
86138	0	a	yes ,
86139	0	a	yeah .
86140	0	a	Well , you can have a piranha at home .
86141	0	a	Huh .
86142	0	a	Or a line .
86143	0	a	A little bit .
86144	0	a	I mean a bird .
86145	0	a	Yeah .
86146	0	a	Do not mess with my birds , yeah .
86147	0	a	It is not very very good drawn , but you can see a cat from it .
86148	0	a	It is a handicapped cat .
86149	0	a	cat .
86150	0	a	I do not think I do not think Darwin would agree with that .
86151	0	a	It is
86152	0	a	, it is not scared .
86153	0	a	He is crying but
86154	0	a	it is i most cats are small .
86155	0	a	Okay .
86156	0	a	He is crying because it is ugl because of his ugliness .
86157	0	a	What do you like about it then ?
86158	0	a	Oh , okay .
86159	0	a	You can handle them .
86160	0	a	Okay .
86161	0	a	Okay .
86162	0	a	Okay ,
86163	0	a	and then we are through the tool training , I guess .
86164	0	a	Okay .
86165	0	a	I would not call it training , but
86166	0	a	Alright .
86167	0	a	Okay , this is something about the project finance .
86168	0	a	The selling price of our remote control is going to be twenty five Euros .
86169	0	a	And our profit aim is fifteen million Euros .
86170	0	a	We are very ambitious on this one .
86171	0	a	The market range is international , so it is going to be sold world wide , and the production cost should be a maximum of twelve Euro fifty per remote control .
86172	0	a	So that is clear .
86173	0	a	Yeah ?
86174	1	a	Okay , we are now going to discuss some stuff when well , we are going to brainstorm about what kind of kemoro romo remote control it is going to be .
86175	0	a	Okay .
86176	0	a	, well tell me about your experiences with the remote controls .
86177	0	a	Do you have know what good experiences with remote controls ?
86178	0	a	Or do they annoy you sometimes ?
86179	0	a	Are they difficult to understand , or maybe they do not interact with different kind of equipment very well ?
86180	0	a	Yeah , okay .
86181	0	a	Yes .
86182	0	a	I do not th
86183	0	a	I do not think the four of us got problems with remote controls , but if you see elderly people , all these buttons , and then they buy new TV because their previous one was stolen or whatever .
86184	0	a	Different .
86185	0	a	Okay .
86186	0	a	And then a totally different remote control with with different functions on different places , and half of the functions a are removed , or whatever .
86187	1	a	, so I think what we need is is a clear remote control with grouped buttons , you know .
86188	1	a	All th all the buttons which apply to the text functions in in one
86189	1	a	Well , one area or whatever ,
86190	0	a	not like the button to enter text on top of the remote control and the button to , yeah , to minimise it to this this or whatever
86191	0	a	o o other functions totally somewhere else .
86192	0	a	Different functions of of
86193	0	a	Okay .
86194	1	a	I think we should group them .
86195	0	a	Yeah .
86196	1	a	And same for the for the volume buttons and the the t
86197	1	a	Well I was
86198	1	a	I was thinking since a TV is mostly used together with a VCR or DVD player or recorder , and not with a stereo ,
86199	1	a	I think it should be good to include functions for VCRs and DVD players , recorders .
86200	0	a	Okay .
86201	1	a	And , is it going to be a remote control that is what it can be used for different kind of equipment , like your TV and your home stereo ?
86202	0	a	Yeah .
86203	0	a	But , the DVD players and home cinema sets often double as stereo hi fi sets probably .
86204	0	a	Yeah .
86205	0	a	It is what , from my experience .
86206	0	a	But is not it
86207	0	a	It is only for television , I thought .
86208	0	a	I do not know .
86209	0	a	Hi fi set is not often used as I know of in combination with television .
86210	0	a	Okay .
86211	0	a	But we going to
86212	0	a	Oh , it is only for televis
86213	0	a	So wha what
86214	0	a	What wha what what document
86215	0	a	But , where where did it
86216	0	a	Where did you find that ?
86217	0	a	Oh , okay .
86218	0	a	Yes .
86219	0	a	Not I thought it was only for television .
86220	0	a	So so we probably do not have to have to have the functions for DVD player or VCR .
86221	0	a	Yes , it is only for television , but
86222	0	a	Well
86223	1	a	well we we are going to brainstorm about that .
86224	1	a	If we think it is useful , we do it .
86225	0	a	, in the email .
86226	0	a	That is right .
86227	0	a	I thought it said
86228	0	a	Yeah , television remote control .
86229	0	a	It is a television remote control .
86230	0	a	But I was thinking since it is useful with DVD
86231	0	a	Yep .
86232	0	a	Yes ,
86233	0	a	Yes , that is something extras .
86234	0	a	Yeah , but most television remote controls support other functions as well .
86235	0	a	So we can
86236	1	a	No , we have to think about that .
86237	0	a	True .
86238	0	a	Yeah .
86239	0	a	True .
86240	0	a	Okay , but we have going to put some a is is it so user friendliness , is a is a pri priority in this case , or
86241	0	a	Okay .
86242	0	a	Yeah , also no one is going to buy it .
86243	0	a	Yeah .
86244	0	a	Yeah ,
86245	0	a	yeah .
86246	0	a	Yeah .
86247	0	a	I guess .
86248	0	a	Only the experts .
86249	0	a	True .
86250	1	a	Well , this the maybe is some aspect of the , or or some point at at which we can excel by making it very useful .
86251	0	a	Yeah .
86252	0	a	That w
86253	0	a	Well , then you are
86254	0	a	you are the usability man , so this going to be a very important task for you then .
86255	0	a	Oh my God .
86256	0	a	Yeah .
86257	0	a	Okay .
86258	0	a	Okay .
86259	1	a	Well , other ideas ?
86260	1	a	How can we make it trendy or something ?
86261	1	a	Do by just sh shape and the look of it ?
86262	1	a	Maybe a can opener underneath it ?
86263	0	a	I do not know .
86264	0	a	, to go with to go with fashion and
86265	0	a	Team Leader .
86266	0	a	For the bear .
86267	1	a	Or someth something special , like MP three player inside of it , or
86268	0	a	Oh , well then the production costs are going to be too high probably .
86269	0	a	I
86270	0	a	I ,
86271	0	a	no I think it
86272	1	a	, I th
86273	1	a	I think yo we have to keep it simple , to get a whole market .
86274	0	a	Yeah , way too high .
86275	0	a	Yep .
86276	1	a	It is international , so we have to use a standard .
86277	1	a	Okay .
86278	1	a	Maybe with different type of fronts or
86279	0	a	Well , m has to be something spectacular or one which makes it
86280	1	a	We going to skip back to the goals probably .
86281	0	a	Well that is an idea of course ,
86282	0	a	yeah .
86283	0	a	original , trendly , and user friendly
86284	0	a	Well , we al also already talked about user friendliness .
86285	0	a	No , well something trendy and original ,
86286	0	a	well that that goes hand in hand I guess .
86287	0	a	Yeah .
86288	0	a	When something is original , it tends to be trendy , probably ,
86289	1	a	or we should make it combination of that .
86290	0	a	Kay , so you
86291	0	a	the technical part of the process is something you are going to look after for ,
86292	1	a	so you have to think about what kind of equipment you want to , you know , you want to manage with it .
86293	0	a	Well , and that is an important part for you then , with gogors regards to the user friendly part of it .
86294	0	a	Use friendly .
86295	0	a	Yep .
86296	1	a	Well , and you should look out for what makes it trendy .
86297	0	a	Well , you know , y like some special feature .
86298	0	a	Or some Does it does it gets some gadgetness or something .
86299	0	a	Yeah .
86300	0	a	Yes , what the market wishes .
86301	0	a	Okay .
86302	0	a	Well , the closing .
86303	0	a	Next meeting starts in thirty minutes .
86304	0	a	Individual , I think so .
86305	0	a	The the Industrial Designer will w or the working design , of course ,
86306	0	a	we will
86307	0	a	Already s said that .
86308	0	a	The User Interface Designer
86309	0	a	is it a User Inter User Interface
86310	0	a	the technical functions design .
86311	0	a	Yeah .
86312	0	a	Yeah ,
86313	0	a	yeah .
86314	0	a	Yeah .
86315	0	a	Interface d

86318	0	a	And the Management Expert of the Marketing Expert .
86319	0	a	User requirements specifi
86320	0	a	Well , this one was already clear to us .
86321	0	a	Specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach .
86322	0	a	I do not know how much time we have left .
86323	0	a	Oh , not many I guess .
86324	0	a	We started at twelve .
86325	0	a	You just got a message .

86335	0	a	He is the whatever .
86336	1	a	Yeah , close it .
86337	1	a	I am going to make some minutes or take some minutes .
86338	0	a	Okay .
86339	0	a	And it is it is clear you can put the stuff in the project documents presentations .
86340	0	a	Yes .
86341	0	a	Okay .
86342	0	a	You can all
86343	0	a	Or we are all
86344	0	a	Yeah .
86345	0	a	Project joc project documents is for showing on the white board .
86346	0	a	Yeah , but we are all familiar with Microsoft PowerPoint , are we ?
86347	0	a	Yeah , okay .
86348	0	a	Yeah .
86349	0	a	Yes .
86350	0	a	Yeah .
86351	1	a	I am going to wri write some stuff down
86352	0	a	and then we are ready .
86353	0	a	Alright .
86354	0	a	Okay .
86355	0	a	Or we can leave already I guess .
86356	0	a	or or sh or should we
86357	0	a	or is important that we leave at exact
86358	0	a	Okay .
86359	0	a	Yeah .
86360	0	a	No .
86361	0	a	No .
86362	0	a	I do not think so .
86363	0	a	I do not think Oh
86364	0	a	Yes ?
86365	0	a	Great .
86366	0	a	Yes .
86367	0	a	We will see each other in thirty minutes .
86368	0	a	Yeah .
86369	0	a	Good luck .
86370	0	a	 
86371	0	a	Here we go again .
86372	0	a	My mouse is not working anymore .
86373	0	a	Oh .
86374	0	a	Oh .
86375	0	a	He is
86376	0	a	when I put it in , is is going to beep beep beep .
86377	0	a	Okay .
86378	0	a	Oh , I got a nice little screen here over here .
86379	0	a	I got like this big black border on every side .
86380	0	a	Okay .
86381	0	a	, okay .
86382	0	a	Everybody ready ?
86383	0	a	Welcome at the functional design meeting , again presented by Maarten .
86384	1	a	I will I will fix it .
86385	0	a	Yeah , it is okay .
86386	0	a	Yeah , whatever .
86387	0	a	this is the agenda , the opening .
86388	0	a	, we have got three presentations .
86389	1	a	And I am going to show you some of the new projects requirements that were sent to me .
86390	1	a	And we are going to make a decision on the remote control functions .
86391	0	a	We have forty minutes .
86392	0	a	Yes .
86393	0	a	Oh , well this is the the closing already .
86394	1	a	So well we start off with the th the first presentation then .
86395	0	a	, I think in we have to do it in in right order .
86396	0	a	Okay .
86397	0	a	Maybe the Well , it
86398	0	a	Oh that .
86399	0	a	I do not know what the right order is .
86400	0	a	So
86401	0	a	No .
86402	0	a	Huh .
86403	0	a	It wo not does not
86404	1	a	Maybe we should start with the the technical functions .
86405	1	a	Okay ,
86406	0	a	how can I get this on the whiteboard ?
86407	0	a	Okay ,
86408	0	a	I have done that .
86409	0	a	Yeah ?
86410	0	a	Well it is you dumped the file in the in the sh in the project document folder .
86411	0	a	In project .
86412	0	a	You have already done that ?
86413	1	a	Well let is close this one .
86414	0	a	No can that open .
86415	0	a	Yes .
86416	1	a	We will just open a new one .
86417	1	a	Open it there .
86418	0	a	, well .
86419	0	a	Yes .
86420	0	a	Uh oh .
86421	0	a	New thing .
86422	1	a	Oh yeah , I have to say something .
86423	0	a	, due to some technical problems I have not digitized the last the meeting minutes .
86424	1	a	But I will make sure that happens next time .
86425	0	a	Okay .
86426	0	a	About the get
86427	0	a	Okay .
86428	1	a	And I will get this one in digital form too .
86429	0	a	Kay , we are going to talk about working design .
86430	0	a	, the method of the remote control is electrical energy , it activates a chip in the remote .
86431	0	a	It is an electrical circuit which compose messages in the form of infrared signals to control the television .
86432	0	a	, it is a nowadays very known , a known technology .
86433	0	a	, the known technology can make a cost very low .
86434	0	a	, it is a wild
86435	0	a	a wide sale of remote controls in the world .
86436	0	a	And and the components are very very cheap .
86437	0	a	, diodes , bat batteries and LED lights , they are needed and they are everywhere available .
86438	0	a	, again , it is a fair price .
86439	0	a	It is a common technology , like I told , the circuit board , it is the most important part of the remote control .
86440	0	a	, we can use for that fibreglass with copper wires ,
86441	0	a	it is it is
86442	0	a	can be made as fast as printing paper .
86443	0	a	It is it is all very
86444	0	a	Yeah , they are making it all the time .
86445	0	a	Okay .
86446	0	a	and it is not very specialised technology .
86447	0	a	Okay .
86448	0	a	I have not come to here , but I have got some images of remote controls .
86449	0	a	They were not very trendy or just just a remote control like everyone knows .
86450	0	a	So I do not know why I should put it here .
86451	0	a	Yes ,
86452	0	a	but I have not made it because of the time .
86453	0	a	Okay .
86454	0	a	But it is the technical side of the remote control .
86455	0	a	Oh .
86456	0	a	Okay .
86457	0	a	What ?
86458	0	a	No .
86459	0	a	Well , we will we will have to skip that part then .
86460	0	a	But you do not think it is a problem to design the technical part of the remote control ?
86461	0	a	It is going to be easy ?
86462	0	a	Okay .
86463	0	a	Yes .
86464	0	a	But nothing restricted for user interface ?
86465	0	a	With technical
86466	0	a	I do not know .
86467	0	a	Yeah .
86468	0	a	, no , it is it is just a part of a known technology ,
86469	0	a	yeah .
86470	0	a	M Okay .
86471	0	a	Kay .
86472	0	a	Remote control is nothing special nowadays .
86473	0	a	R regardless of what type of functions we want to implement .
86474	0	a	Okay .
86475	0	a	Does not really matter .
86476	0	a	I do not think so , because of the all the televisions there are a few maybe a couple of televisions with the new functions ,
86477	0	a	but is it useful to put them on a on a standard remote ?
86478	0	a	No .
86479	0	a	But I kind of
86480	0	a	Yes .
86481	0	a	Okay .
86482	0	a	Yeah , okay .
86483	0	a	Well , the technical functions .
86484	0	a	Okay .
86485	0	a	Well , we will see .
86486	0	a	We will see later on .
86487	0	a	, well I do not know if you got the same pictures as I got ,
86488	0	a	but I got these two ,
86489	1	a	and I think they are we have to focus on the one hand the expert view or the novice user .
86490	0	a	No .
86491	0	a	th I think it is it is very much depending on the user requirements ,
86492	0	a	I do not s know who is doing t
86493	0	a	Yeah ,
86494	0	a	but it
86495	0	a	I think that is very important to watch what kind of functions there we want to put in a remote control .
86496	0	a	Well , will there be some user requirements later on ?
86497	0	a	The ones I I have received from the account manager .
86498	0	a	Yeah .
86499	1	a	Well , we will keep this in mind , and then discuss it later on .
86500	0	a	Yeah ,
86501	1	a	well y we can put functions in it when
86502	1	a	yeah , when we get the user requirements and we can update it .
86503	0	a	Uh huh .
86504	0	a	Okay ,
86505	0	a	but this real this big d distinction between this type of remote .
86506	1	a	we should we should choose one we should not compromise but really choose for expert viewer or novice v
86507	0	a	Yeah ?
86508	0	a	Well , what that is what you want trying to say .
86509	0	a	Yes , I agree .
86510	0	a	Yeah .
86511	0	a	Well , yeah
86512	1	a	w if you want try a a a huge market , if you want to reach a huge market , like elderly people and we have to choose for novice user .
86513	0	a	Okay .
86514	0	a	Okay .
86515	0	a	But I do not know .
86516	0	a	It is it is really depending on how how how far the the the remote controls are already in n in use .
86517	0	a	Yeah , well some of these
86518	0	a	, yeah .
86519	0	a	Well , some of that will
86520	0	a	Yeah ,
86521	0	a	but i but it will be more clear when we come to the u some of the new requirements .
86522	0	a	Yeah , probably
86523	0	a	, yeah .
86524	0	a	Yes .
86525	0	a	So
86526	0	a	well , there are l at least basic functions , like just th the channels one till nine , on and off switch , which must be clear with a red button or something like that .
86527	0	a	, most standard have volume , of course , and a mute function , and , of course , the next and previous channel .
86528	0	a	I think that is just basic what we need .
86529	1	a	And from that on we can user requirements what we need more .
86530	0	a	Yeah , I just I thought Joost was looking at the trendy the trends in the markets ,
86531	0	a	and I do not know if there are any if you put more functions , more buttons , maybe it is com becoming less trendy or something like that .
86532	0	a	Yes .
86533	0	a	M you can just you can k
86534	1	a	you can keep it in mind that .
86535	0	a	I have not really found a conclusion like that .
86536	0	a	Yeah .
86537	0	a	I do not know .
86538	0	a	, I th I thought the the with less buttons you can make a more trendier
86539	0	a	yeah
86540	0	a	, more trendier design , I think .
86541	0	a	Design .
86542	0	a	I think .
86543	0	a	Sounds interesting .
86544	0	a	Yeah ?
86545	0	a	, well , that is all I have to say , I think .
86546	0	a	Okay .
86547	0	a	Yeah , that was it .
86548	0	a	Alright .
86549	1	a	Well , then the Marketing expert can tell us something about the current market .
86550	1	a	Yes .
86551	0	a	Yeah .
86552	0	a	It is alright .
86553	0	a	Alright , I have done some research for functional requirements .
86554	0	a	yes .
86555	0	a	The working method there were hundred w h one hundred people , how do you say , f watched using remote controls in the usability lab and they also filled out a questionnaire with a few questions .
86556	0	a	, I have lined them up here .
86557	0	a	, ask whether common remote control looks good or not , about willingness to spend money on remote control , about zapping behaviour , and and stuff like that .
86558	0	a	I have found some interesting things .
86559	0	a	We do we do got a market .
86560	0	a	three out of four people claim m to find remote controls ugly .
86561	0	a	So if we make a trendy design , we sure have seventy fi seventy five percent of the market , which you can reach .
86562	0	a	, three out of four users zaps a lot , as I quoted here from the results .
86563	0	a	Zap buttons are used one hundred and sixty eight times per hour .
86564	0	a	That is quite a lot .
86565	0	a	relevant options are , of course , power buttons .
86566	0	a	Although , only used once per hour .
86567	0	a	, channel selection , volume and buttons for text ,
86568	0	a	and the more , yeah ,
86569	0	a	other functions , like audio settings , video settings , sound settings are not said to be very important and very much used .
86570	0	a	Furthermore , fifty percent says they only use ten percent of the buttons on a remote control .
86571	0	a	That does not say we got we can leave ninety percent off .
86572	0	a	But it sure says we should not make it too complicated .
86573	0	a	Fifty percent also claims to have lost a remote control very often in the room .
86574	0	a	And an important thing here , the most important customers , which is over seventy percent of our market , is in the age range of thirty six to sixty five years old .
86575	0	a	And elderly people , our market , are less interested in nice features , but more willingly to spend more money on remote controls .
86576	0	a	So , what I was thinking
86577	0	a	oh , wrong side .
86578	1	a	We should not implement too much features on on our remote control , because elderly people will get th lost .
86579	1	a	Group features for a higher usability ,
86580	0	a	what I was claiming in the previous meeting .
86581	1	a	, all the settings , about audio settings , video settings and channel settings , which are not very often used , we could group them on one button and make them accessible in one menu button or whatever ,
86582	0	a	because they are used very rarely and well , it there are a lot of options there , so we can really make
86583	0	a	yeah ,
86584	0	a	how do you say , we can spare at buttons over there .
86585	0	a	Okay .
86586	1	a	And , if you want to implement VCR and DVD options , group them in the button ,
86587	0	a	not too Yeah .
86588	1	a	Small buttons , so they wo not be very ,
86589	0	a	how do you say
86590	0	a	Yes , wo not be very present ,
86591	0	a	thank you .
86592	0	a	Visually presents .
86593	0	a	And a trendy look , well , although seventy percent of the market is consists of elderly people who do not really care for trendy looks or whatever , I guess it can do no harm to make it trendy for the other thirty percent .
86594	0	a	That was kind of what I found .
86595	0	a	Okay .
86596	0	a	Okay .
86597	0	a	Okay .
86598	1	a	Well , then we I am going to show you some of the new project requirements
86599	1	a	and then we going to discuss on what features we find important .
86600	0	a	Yes .
86601	0	a	, well some of the new requirements make some of your findings quite irrelevant , I think .
86602	0	a	Because s decided to put They have decide to put two additional requirements forward .
86603	0	a	Well , now I see four .
86604	0	a	Two ?
86605	0	a	No , I agree , I agree .
86606	0	a	That is kind of strange .
86607	0	a	Well , they say tele teletext becomes outdated since the popularity of the internet .
86608	0	a	Well , I think that may be so , but well , we ca not just leave the teletext button off .
86609	0	a	Well
86610	0	a	No way .
86611	0	a	It is impossible , I think .
86612	1	a	So the compromise we could make is just to make one teletext button , you know , like on and off , and do not make a lot of special put a lot of special features on it to make it transparent or
86613	0	a	You know , it is just you want you want to be able to make use of teletext , but not to play with it that much .
86614	0	a	Not too much , no .
86615	0	a	Yeah .
86616	1	a	So we have to think of that .
86617	0	a	The remote control should only be used for television .
86618	0	a	Otherwise , the project becomes more complex , which endangers the time t t ma the time to market .
86619	1	a	So maybe we should leave all DVD and VCR related features off completely .
86620	0	a	Yeah .
86621	0	a	Okay .
86622	0	a	I do not know .
86623	0	a	I think that that is what they are trying to say .
86624	0	a	, our current customers are within the age group of forty plus .
86625	0	a	New products should reach a new market with customers that are younger than forty .
86626	0	a	So you talked about the elderly who were willing to spend more on a remote control and who were interested .
86627	0	a	But , well , they are not relevant because we are aiming at a younger Yeah , but it is it is is a dif
86628	0	a	it is a fact that the th th that bigger market you are talking about , we already cover that .
86629	0	a	I do not really agree actually , to be honest .
86630	0	a	It is a very small market which we will approach then if we want to reach customers younger than forty .
86631	0	a	It is only like thirty percent of the total market .
86632	0	a	Mayb
86633	0	a	yeah ?
86634	0	a	Okay .
86635	0	a	Our company already sells remote control to the older people , but we we also want , you know , a new customer group .
86636	0	a	That is the one we have not covered yet .
86637	0	a	So I think that is what the problem is .
86638	0	a	We have not got remote controls for
86639	0	a	Well I think , yeah .
86640	1	a	Maybe maybe we can compromise a little bit .
86641	0	a	Yeah , I think so .
86642	0	a	Maybe if it is
86643	0	a	no no ,
86644	0	a	but I think we have to just keep in mind what the older age group wants .
86645	0	a	Not too much then , bu alright .
86646	1	a	So maybe we can make a remote control that is primarily interesting for the younger group , but is not that bad for an older person either .
86647	0	a	Yes .
86648	0	a	, our corporate image sh should stay recognisable in our products .
86649	0	a	Our product is corporate colour and slogan must be implemented in the new design .
86650	0	a	Okay , something else nice to know .
86651	0	a	But what is our slogan ?
86652	0	a	The slogan
86653	0	a	Puts fashion in electronics .
86654	0	a	Sorry ?
86655	1	a	Yeah , you will have to look that up .
86656	1	a	Yeah , I will have a look .
86657	0	a	We put the fashion in electronics .
86658	0	a	I think it is something about the
86659	0	a	Oh , okay .
86660	0	a	I thought it w might be , let is make things better or something , but
86661	0	a	Okay well ,
86662	1	a	let is go back to the the agenda .
86663	0	a	Sense and simplicity .
86664	0	a	Sense simplicity .
86665	0	a	So we have now had to the three presentations .
86666	0	a	We know about the new project requirements .
86667	1	a	That means we can well d
86668	1	a	yeah , discuss on the remote control functions .
86669	1	a	Well , if I can make a start ,
86670	0	a	I think it is becoming more clear what kind of remote control it is going to be ,
86671	0	a	and I already talked about the maybe you have a f familiar with the rem remote control that has the the can opener underneath it .
86672	0	a	I think we are we are looking for some
86673	0	a	Yeah , we we are looking for a really simple remote control with only basic TV functions .
86674	0	a	Y well , that
86675	0	a	Yeah .
86676	0	a	Yeah .
86677	0	a	Well , to be honest , if our aim group is till forty , not older than forty , maybe that is not very
86678	0	a	yeah , we do not really need to have a simple remote control .
86679	0	a	Yeah .
86680	1	a	I think we can implement more functions then ,
86681	0	a	because basically the younger people are more able to adapt to new technology
86682	0	a	and therefore will be a more
86683	0	a	Yes .
86684	0	a	Yeah , but wha
86685	0	a	But
86686	0	a	Yeah ,
86687	0	a	but you sai
86688	0	a	you said that that a lot of functions are not used .
86689	0	a	Yeah ,
86690	0	a	yeah .
86691	0	a	M
86692	0	a	yeah ,
86693	0	a	that is why well a lot of the use the requirements the the account manager sent me , I think they are are c are contradicting each other , because they want a simpler design , and no other s functions than just TV , but they s do aim at a younger
86694	0	a	Well , ma
86695	0	a	But I think you we can make some discuss distinctions in what kin in the , know , th th in functions you have
86696	0	a	Y
86697	0	a	Well you have different kind of equipment in your room , like a t TV and a DVD player .
86698	0	a	Yeah .
86699	0	a	So why should j we put this function in ?
86700	0	a	I think more
86701	0	a	I think people younger people are more looking for just a trendy look than more functions .
86702	0	a	Well , I think
86703	0	a	Yes .
86704	0	a	You can , know , you
86705	0	a	you can make very d you can put very detailed functions regarding the TV set on your remote control with the with the , you know , audio settings and v screen settings .
86706	0	a	We do not want that .
86707	0	a	I think that was that became clear .
86708	0	a	We do not want .
86709	0	a	But w maybe we should put some func ,
86710	0	a	I know that the younger people will most likely have a DVD player they want to , you know , they want to
86711	0	a	control , remotely .
86712	0	a	Yeah , control .
86713	0	a	Yeah , but you said
86714	0	a	Yeah , d yeah , but th the functions are not in the remote control we are making .
86715	0	a	No ,
86716	0	a	yeah , th th
86717	0	a	the user requirements of the the The new project requirements told us not to
86718	1	a	But maybe w Yeah .
86719	0	a	It is n
86720	0	a	Yeah .
86721	0	a	Yeah .
86722	1	a	I think we maybe should
86723	1	a	Yeah , well we should put some functions for other maybe for other equipment on it .
86724	1	a	But just the basic functions .
86725	1	a	Maybe like rewind and wind ,
86726	0	a	or n what d what do you guys think ?
86727	0	a	Yeah , if as far as possible .
86728	1	a	But you can put them under the same button .
86729	0	a	Not much more than that .
86730	0	a	Yep .
86731	1	a	Or we can u u
86732	1	a	we could put them behind the flip flap or whatever .
86733	0	a	So t
86734	0	a	Yeah .
86735	0	a	But what do you think ?
86736	0	a	Do th should we implement features that or functions that to control other devices ?
86737	0	a	No , you do not think so ?
86738	0	a	Yeah , the new requirements say so .
86739	0	a	No .
86740	0	a	No , new requirements say no .
86741	0	a	So Yeah , but
86742	0	a	I i if it is too simple th they wo not use the remote control , they use their own th th with lot more functions .
86743	1	a	But you can put a play and stop and and rewind .
86744	0	a	Well , maybe it is
86745	0	a	maybe there there there is something th m most of the time these functions do not support the particular device as well as their their own remote control .
86746	0	a	You know , a lot of DVD players have some tricky settings with Yep , exactly .
86747	0	a	Yes , but we Huh .
86748	0	a	Y yes .
86749	0	a	That is that is wha
86750	0	a	No no , you do not No
86751	0	a	no , you do not need it .
86752	0	a	But but for for example , VCR , that is better example in this case .
86753	0	a	I think on a remote control for television you do not need to be able to programme the VCR to start recording at three PM or whatever , just play , stop , rewind and fast forward .
86754	0	a	No , no .
86755	0	a	Exactly .
86756	0	a	No , no .
86757	0	a	Okay , but we have to think w we have to think DVD I th , I guess ,
86758	0	a	so but from my experience it is kind of a lot of DVD players , you know , like forwarding , goes differently .
86759	0	a	Yeah , I know ,
86760	0	a	but
86761	0	a	Yes .
86762	0	a	, you get two speed or eight speed or sixteen speed .
86763	0	a	, yeah .
86764	0	a	It is c sometimes a bit difficult .
86765	1	a	Maybe if we just leave the DVD functional m
86766	0	a	Well , I was thinking about putting it in , but concerning the project requirements and what you just said , I think we m should focus on the TV then .
86767	0	a	Yeah ,
86768	0	a	but just
86769	0	a	keep it simple
86770	0	a	and look more at th
86771	0	a	No .
86772	0	a	And and it is just an a complimentary remote and not a universal one .
86773	1	a	If you want to keep it simple , you can make a universal remote .
86774	0	a	It is only for television .
86775	0	a	Okay .
86776	0	a	So
86777	0	a	Yeah .
86778	0	a	Yes , but there are there are
86779	1	a	But how wi how will you be able to handle a whole market ?
86780	0	a	There are a dozen of dozens of of remote controls that have
86781	0	a	Yes , but you could put
86782	1	a	on the z on the zap buttons you can put it to to access all the same pages .
86783	0	a	It is just
86784	0	a	a s it
86785	0	a	it should be something that is like a gadget on your coffee table , and it is just for when you you you jump on the couch , you pick up the the the nice remote , the simple one , just to put on the television , nothing more .
86786	0	a	Yeah .
86787	0	a	Yeah , nothing more .
86788	0	a	Okay .
86789	0	a	Exactly .
86790	0	a	Alright .
86791	0	a	, but what televis
86792	1	a	Yeah , we we will make w this one trendy .
86793	0	a	Yeah .
86794	1	a	And simple .
86795	0	a	The user interface is easy .
86796	1	a	Well , we we will come to that , but ju first on the on the functions .
86797	1	a	So we should put zap buttons on it .
86798	1	a	, also numbers , to to go to the specific channels .
86799	0	a	And the basic
86800	0	a	yeah , basic functions , yeah .
86801	0	a	Yes , definitely
86802	0	a	, yeah .
86803	0	a	Okay ,
86804	1	a	a t a teletext button should be there .
86805	0	a	It is too much integrated in the other .
86806	1	a	But just one big teletext button , on and off .
86807	0	a	Yeah .
86808	0	a	Probably .
86809	0	a	Yeah ,
86810	1	a	and maybe two or three other options , but not nothing more than that .
86811	1	a	I think stop function is very useful .
86812	0	a	If you have a a page which consists of more pages , and you are not a very quick reader , then I think it is very irritating if the next page shows up , but Well , I use it very regularly , the action .
86813	0	a	Oh , okay .
86814	0	a	Yeah ,
86815	0	a	but I think that becomes too difficult , it is not a very common function and people will have to read up on their remote then .
86816	0	a	I
86817	0	a	re I use it quite often .
86818	0	a	Yeah ,
86819	0	a	yeah ,
86820	0	a	but maybe you s
86821	0	a	yeah
86822	0	a	yeah
86823	0	a	, maybe y you do ,
86824	0	a	but I have never heard of it in the first place .
86825	0	a	Will you look
86826	1	a	Look at the market .
86827	0	a	And
86828	1	a	we have to
86829	0	a	well t yeah , and t and teletext is becoming outdated .
86830	0	a	We just want to see what programmes are on and what time it is probably .
86831	0	a	Yeah .
86832	0	a	I do not know .
86833	0	a	I think that that is kin getting too complex for our remote .
86834	0	a	Well
86835	0	a	Yeah , I , it is
86836	0	a	Sunday I always use it for the yeah , for the soccer
86837	0	a	Well , when you when you look
86838	0	a	for example , a couple of weeks ago I looked at the for the flights , and there are a lot of flights in one page , so if if th
86839	0	a	Yeah , but
86840	0	a	True .
86841	0	a	I do not know what you th guys think .
86842	0	a	Might be .
86843	0	a	Might be .
86844	0	a	Yeah , but do you like to have a such a s stop button ?
86845	0	a	Or do you think it
86846	0	a	I think it is a kind of very rare and special function .
86847	0	a	Yeah .
86848	0	a	Okay , it goes
86849	0	a	Yeah , but that is kind of stuff we should do on the internet right now .
86850	0	a	That is why it was said in the in the use in the r new requirements .
86851	1	a	If you have seven pages , you can go up and down .
86852	0	a	Well yeah ,
86853	0	a	lots of new televisions can store pages , you know , and then you can just skip manually through them using
86854	1	a	I think we should just put one teletext button on it .
86855	0	a	Yes .
86856	0	a	Then we meet the new requirements .
86857	0	a	we also meet the other thin y
86858	0	a	you sh
86859	0	a	you just re
86860	1	a	we have to choose for the the simple design , I guess .
86861	0	a	A simple
86862	0	a	yeah .
86863	0	a	Okay .
86864	0	a	well , what functions do we have to decide on ?
86865	0	a	Or do we
86866	0	a	I dunno if we have t stif specifically name all the functions
86867	0	a	we n we want .
86868	0	a	We have the zap and the volume .
86869	1	a	Should we do m make them very big ?
86870	1	a	The the the zap button .
86871	0	a	D d
86872	0	a	Th that is that is that is considered to be trendy also .
86873	0	a	I think the plus and the minus button should be quite present , yep .
86874	0	a	Yes .
86875	0	a	But trendy , yeah .
86876	0	a	I do not know .
86877	1	a	Or maybe you should place them on a , in a special way ?
86878	0	a	Yeah , something
86879	1	a	or somethin special way to to zap through the
86880	0	a	it has to s it has to be yeah , and quick .
86881	1	a	Maybe we can make a kind of a joystick .
86882	0	a	Original .
86883	0	a	You have to use it very quickly .
86884	0	a	It was
86885	0	a	True .
86886	0	a	Yep .
86887	1	a	If you grab the remote , your hands should be on top of the plus .
86888	0	a	Yeah ,
86889	1	a	and it the buttons should make it possible to to zap through your channels in a rapid at a rapid pace .
86890	0	a	Yes .
86891	0	a	Oh , what should we decide on then ?
86892	0	a	I think in a in a case of this simple remote control , the technical aspects which were not worked out already , but it w should not be a problem then .
86893	0	a	But
86894	0	a	No , it is o just signals and the television d does the rest .
86895	0	a	Yeah .
86896	0	a	Yep .
86897	0	a	Maybe
86898	0	a	maybe we
86899	1	a	the batteries maybe .
86900	0	a	No , okay ,
86901	0	a	but we do not have to , when we do not want to control other devices
86902	0	a	, I think it makes it even more simple .
86903	0	a	No .
86904	1	a	If you use large batteries or small batter batteries .
86905	1	a	The most standard batteries .
86906	0	a	I think
86907	0	a	I think that we should use d
86908	0	a	yeah , not not the b the watch kind
86909	0	a	th the most
86910	0	a	Well , it has to be simple , and I wi
86911	0	a	Which are most likely to be found somewhere in the house , you know .
86912	1	a	I think double A .
86913	0	a	Yeah ?
86914	0	a	Yeah .
86915	0	a	Yep .
86916	0	a	The most ordinary batteries .
86917	0	a	Okay .
86918	0	a	Yep .
86919	0	a	Oh .
86920	0	a	How much time do we ha we have left ?
86921	0	a	M m m more than thirty minutes ?
86922	0	a	ten twenty minutes .
86923	0	a	I think about twenty minutes .
86924	0	a	But i in a way we have to be special .
86925	0	a	Well , these these should not
86926	0	a	Yeah .
86927	1	a	Early break .
86928	0	a	Yeah , okay .
86929	0	a	But that is that is
86930	1	a	Do you have you have you think about tha thought about that ?
86931	1	a	How we can what the extra touch can be .
86932	0	a	Maybe th m
86933	0	a	For the remote control .
86934	1	a	Do you suggest design or the shape or some gadget
86935	1	a	f f kind of feature or
86936	0	a	Well , it was something about how we lose them .
86937	1	a	Maybe it should be a remote control when you you clap you hands
86938	1	a	it makes some noise or some gadget kind of thing .
86939	0	a	I think that is
86940	0	a	n that is more for a for an age range or ten to twelve or whatever .
86941	0	a	To find him .
86942	0	a	Yeah .
86943	0	a	That is maybe yeah .
86944	0	a	I do not know .
86945	0	a	I do not know .
86946	0	a	Nah , a lot of people like to have such kind kind of kind of gay kind of things .
86947	0	a	It w it w should be like a birthday present or something that you give someone , and it is i has something nice .
86948	0	a	Yeah ,
86949	0	a	yeah , that is good one ,
86950	0	a	yep .
86951	0	a	Yeah .
86952	1	a	Or maybe it w should have a big light that can flash or something on it ,
86953	0	a	or maybe it should or an
86954	1	a	or the like the the can opener .
86955	1	a	Maybe it contains some feature that you do not normally link to a remote control .
86956	0	a	I think it is very impor because we are going to make such a basic remote control , we have to do something to make it special .
86957	0	a	Yeah .
86958	0	a	It is going to cost twenty five Euros .
86959	0	a	I think the can opener i is a brilliant idea actually , because television and beer is not a rare combination .
86960	0	a	Yeah , but the well , it is already been done .
86961	0	a	Yeah , but that is
86962	0	a	yeah .
86963	0	a	Nah .
86964	0	a	Yeah , that is true .
86965	0	a	But
86966	0	a	and I think it is going to be very it has to be sturdy or something ,
86967	1	a	so maybe with with bouncing pads so that you can just throw it on the floor or something .
86968	0	a	Yes .
86969	0	a	it has to be used something special ,
86970	0	a	and you really it has to ,
86971	0	a	you know y not s people ,
86972	0	a	when they buy it , they have to think ,
86973	0	a	well this one lasts for a long time .
86974	0	a	Yeah .
86975	0	a	Yep .
86976	0	a	We are really going to use them .
86977	0	a	Not some thing you you throw away next week , you know .
86978	0	a	No , that is true .
86979	0	a	So maybe that is i
86980	0	a	I think that is when when we decide on these type of functions , know , basic functions , it is very important to find something like this .
86981	0	a	So there is a very important task for you .
86982	1	a	And maybe we can all think about it .
86983	0	a	Be original , yeah .
86984	0	a	, also for you maybe , when t you it is very nice when you can be entra when you can be trendy , and and and al as in a friend use friendly as well , you know .
86985	0	a	And use friendly , yeah .
86986	1	a	So big buttons , flashy design , and maybe some kind of gadget kind of thing .
86987	0	a	Yeah .
86988	0	a	Yeah .
86989	1	a	Must brain storm .
86990	0	a	Uh huh .
86991	0	a	Yeah ,
86992	1	a	a swapable front or whatever .
86993	0	a	Yeah , or just different colours would be
86994	0	a	I do not know if people also want to spend more money on fronts for their remote control .
86995	0	a	Well
86996	0	a	Why not ?
86997	0	a	More money for us .
86998	0	a	It could be be
86999	0	a	Yeah , you never know , but
87000	0	a	But it
87001	1	a	and I think we have to make it quite big .
87002	0	a	Yeah .
87003	0	a	Yeah .
87004	0	a	Quite big .
87005	0	a	Yes , definitely , definitely .
87006	0	a	Yeah , you think ?
87007	1	a	A standard or something .
87008	0	a	Yeah ,
87009	0	a	people
87010	0	a	So , and and also because it is expensive .
87011	0	a	That is to be a formed for your hand .
87012	0	a	If you want it to be something , you know , it is ha does not have much functions
87013	0	a	want to be you do not want to get it
87014	0	a	l make it
87015	0	a	Yes , it it
87016	0	a	it should be f
87017	0	a	be visible nearly anywhere in the room .
87018	0	a	As I as I said during my presentation , fifty percent o
87019	0	a	Yeah .
87020	0	a	And shou and should ni look nice when you put it on a table .
87021	1	a	I
87022	1	a	I think you m might want to put it
87023	0	a	yeah ,
87024	0	a	that it
87025	0	a	it it
87026	0	a	it stands up .
87027	1	a	Yeah , you have to put it on its
87028	1	a	So it is like a vase or something you put on a table .
87029	0	a	A face ?
87030	0	a	Or yeah , yeah .
87031	0	a	no no , put stuff inside it .
87032	0	a	Yeah .
87033	0	a	More like a joystick then .
87034	0	a	But , it is like like a statue or something
87035	0	a	Yeah
87036	0	a	yeah ,
87037	0	a	but
87038	0	a	yeah ,
87039	0	a	but you also can put it somewhere near the window in That
87040	0	a	it is it is fashionable .
87041	0	a	Yeah ,
87042	0	a	yeah ,
87043	0	a	I see what you mean ,
87044	0	a	yep .
87045	0	a	It is like you have four phones .
87046	0	a	Something like that .
87047	0	a	If you do that , but I do not know if that is possible within the production cost of twelve and a half Euros .
87048	0	a	I I do not
87049	0	a	Oh , yeah .
87050	1	a	I in in the base we could like make a button , and if you push it , the remote control itself s makes noise .
87051	0	a	That is probably stupid ,
87052	0	a	but as I found here , fifty percent ,
87053	0	a	was it fifty ?
87054	0	a	fifty percent
87055	0	a	fifty percent often loses remote control .
87056	0	a	But that is that is fun for the first time , and then the second
87057	0	a	Or you can
87058	0	a	Yeah .
87059	0	a	Yeah ,
87060	0	a	but but when you when it gets lost , how can you press the button to make it
87061	0	a	Oh , okay .
87062	0	a	No , of the base the the the the the the the thing you put it in .
87063	0	a	On the television .
87064	0	a	Oh , like this .
87065	0	a	, that is kind of nice .
87066	1	a	If an a button in in that
87067	0	a	Yeah , you can ma make rechargeable one , yeah .
87068	1	a	And then also you do not even need batteries , because you can make it chargeable .
87069	0	a	A char chargeable .
87070	0	a	Yeah .
87071	0	a	Yeah , that w yeah ,
87072	0	a	but yeah ,
87073	0	a	the pro No ,
87074	0	a	well I think that it might be t
87075	0	a	p
87076	0	a	Well , nee
87077	0	a	but we do not
87078	0	a	Yeah .
87079	0	a	Why not .
87080	0	a	Why not .
87081	0	a	Maybe you , but we do not know much about production cost ,
87082	0	a	but when you you can imagine that when you spend twenty five Euros on a remote control and it is a basic remote control , then the then the money there must be money to spend on that kind of st you know , rechargeable units .
87083	0	a	With recharger .
87084	0	a	It should only cost twelve and a half Euros , of course .
87085	0	a	Aye ?
87086	0	a	Yeah , okay .
87087	0	a	Yeah , but we would d ma we would do it in Taiwan
87088	0	a	and So , it is not going to be that expen
87089	0	a	I
87090	0	a	I think it is a great idea .
87091	0	a	Production .
87092	0	a	It should be possible .
87093	0	a	I think it is a good idea .
87094	0	a	Yeah .
87095	0	a	S some kind of be
87096	0	a	I have never seen that before , and you make it be
87097	0	a	, you see it with the mo
87098	0	a	the mouses nowadays .
87099	0	a	To make a base or something ?
87100	0	a	It is it is it is
87101	0	a	it is
87102	0	a	it is not the purpose to be handy , it is .
87103	0	a	Yes .
87104	0	a	Yes , definitely .
87105	0	a	Yeah .
87106	0	a	Yes , but is that handy ?
87107	0	a	But but remote controls remote controls nowadays can can last two years , three years , with with t two batteries .
87108	0	a	Well , I well it is really ch
87109	0	a	you can recharge it , so
87110	0	a	you ha never have the battery problem .
87111	0	a	That is one .
87112	0	a	And you can always find your remote control up , okay .
87113	1	a	Well , maybe yeah , you could when that is when it is too costly , you could probably skip the recharger ,
87114	0	a	but you will you do need also an
87115	0	a	, also you would need a battery in the the base unit as well , you know .
87116	0	a	And then you
87117	0	a	Yes .
87118	0	a	Does it makes it kind of
87119	0	a	Yeah ,
87120	0	a	yeah .
87121	0	a	Well y you you could connect that to two hundred to twenty volts , of course .
87122	0	a	Or
87123	0	a	But you pay for it .
87124	0	a	I do not know .
87125	0	a	Okay .
87126	0	a	Yeah , but that is not it is ugly , I think .
87127	0	a	Yeah .
87128	0	a	Yeah , but then it is very easy to make it also a rechargeab I do not think that is going to cost much to make it also a recharge function in it .
87129	0	a	No .
87130	0	a	On the other hand , if you do not do it , we can also make a nice bay .
87131	0	a	I mean , it looks trendy and still still put a bleep function in it , but I think the bay is definitely Sure , why not .
87132	0	a	Yeah .
87133	0	a	I think it is a good idea .
87134	0	a	And make it , you know , we we
87135	0	a	Well , we it is
87136	0	a	it is not a t a most costly remote control .
87137	1	a	We can save on the on the functions .
87138	1	a	We just put some simple button in , make it big and sturdy , nothing more , and just make s sure there is some noise that it can make , or probably some kind of cheap light thing around it or that it that it lights up ,
87139	0	a	it is also nice .
87140	0	a	Yep .
87141	0	a	And if you put it away , I think it is w we have to we that is
87142	0	a	it is not a easy market .
87143	0	a	Yeah .
87144	0	a	Yeah .
87145	1	a	We have to something special .
87146	0	a	Yeah .
87147	0	a	And for twenty five Euros people want something remote c special from your mote control , and we ca not deliver that in r with regards to the functions ,
87148	0	a	because we are not going to put
87149	0	a	Yeah .
87150	0	a	True .
87151	0	a	Yeah .
87152	0	a	Definitely .
87153	0	a	With eye candy , ear candy , whatever .
87154	0	a	Yeah , definitely .
87155	1	a	And then when make it , you know , nice looking shape and this
87156	1	a	and then you also you got the stand up thing .
87157	0	a	Yeah .
87158	0	a	I think I think it is a good idea .
87159	0	a	Yeah .
87160	0	a	Yeah , it must be must be a gadget to have .
87161	0	a	Yeah .
87162	0	a	Definitely , yeah .
87163	0	a	Oh , if it let is
87164	1	a	well , we will see what is possible concerning the the costs , and if it is possible we will do that .
87165	0	a	Yeah .
87166	1	a	And we even try to save up on other stuff to make sure we can do such a thing .
87167	1	a	And the first thing we the most likeable thing to to n to skip is then probably the recharge function or something .
87168	1	a	If that is too expensive , we wo not do that .
87169	0	a	Yeah , we c
87170	1	a	Or just give a beep when the battery is out or down .
87171	0	a	But it would be nice .
87172	0	a	It would be nice , yes .
87173	0	a	It is the idea .
87174	0	a	I know that batteries last long nowadays .
87175	0	a	And and what people just think about , well , I will never have to buy any r batteries again , so
87176	0	a	y b because it is very annoying when your battery is empty .
87177	0	a	And you know then when you have not batteries around , and probably for two weeks , your remo I have experienced that that Yeah , okay .
87178	0	a	Most televisions break down before the battery pack is empty , so yes .
87179	0	a	So , easy functions .
87180	0	a	Well , we will we will I think we will work that out ,
87181	0	a	zapping , numbers on it , bi
87182	0	a	Yeah .
87183	0	a	Yeah , why not .
87184	0	a	But it is also annoying .
87185	0	a	cause as long as it stays as it ke keeps working , you are not very motivated to do something about it .
87186	0	a	Yeah .
87187	0	a	true .
87188	0	a	Then it beeps all the time and .
87189	0	a	No , that is true .
87190	0	a	You do not want to have ever have those problems , and you wo not have if if you have the rechargeable .
87191	0	a	And you do not have to use the unit , you can also put it on the side if people do not like it .
87192	0	a	, i i in the in the ma
87193	0	a	Yeah , but it w I mean , if if they pay for it because they think , oh , that is a great idea , I am going to use it .
87194	0	a	Why not .
87195	0	a	And when it , you know , when time goes by and they think , well , I will never put him in the recharger , I think last long enough , then they put it on side and they can use it now and then .
87196	0	a	Then when they look get m
87197	0	a	I
87198	0	a	I
87199	0	a	I know for sure that everybody who buys this remote control , within a couple of months of they will be in the situation that they they are seeking for the remote control , they want to see something quick and just push the button and th , I think it is brilliant .
87200	0	a	Yeah .
87201	0	a	Bleep bleep bleep , oh there it is , yeah .
87202	0	a	Yeah , I have never it is so simple , but I have never seen it .
87203	0	a	Yeah .
87204	0	a	Yeah .
87205	0	a	No .
87206	0	a	And you can leave it just there .
87207	0	a	Nearly .
87208	1	a	M maybe we should really do this .
87209	0	a	Yeah .
87210	0	a	Yeah .
87211	0	a	Okay now , well , how much time have we got left ?
87212	0	a	These clocks are not synched .
87213	0	a	Yes .
87214	0	a	Oh , now I have put well
87215	0	a	, it is twenty p
87216	0	a	Okay , so we have ten minutes or something ?
87217	0	a	Yeah , but we are we are done .
87218	0	a	Yeah ,
87219	0	a	I will
87220	0	a	fifteen minutes .
87221	0	a	Something like that , yeah .
87222	0	a	I think .
87223	0	a	We have decided on the functions .
87224	0	a	Well , there is some
87225	0	a	oh .
87226	0	a	There is a closing sheet .
87227	0	a	We have lunch break , and then we have thirty minutes of individual work .
87228	0	a	Oh .
87229	0	a	Oh okay , I will make sure
87230	0	a	I will
87231	0	a	I had some problems with the digitising the the first minutes , the the s the next minutes wo not be a problem ,
87232	1	a	but I will try to make sure the first one will be in the folder too ,
87233	0	a	but maybe it wo not work , but you will see .
87234	0	a	I think these are more important than the first ones , so
87235	0	a	We will see .
87236	1	a	Can you make an a part of f folder for the minutes maybe ?
87237	0	a	That not not everything in one one folder .
87238	0	a	Maarten , five minutes .
87239	0	a	Oh , five minutes .
87240	0	a	Yeah , because I
87241	0	a	I d
87242	0	a	I did the first minutes I did
87243	0	a	were were were a bit scratchy , you know .
87244	0	a	Then I did a s second one with a nicer layout , which I could , know , use for the other ones well , but I d think I forgot to do put done under the first one , and when you go write a second it is get it is not working when you try to write second paper or something .
87245	0	a	Yeah .
87246	0	a	Maybe .
87247	1	a	No , that is true , yeah .
87248	0	a	And then you
87249	0	a	you had to overwrite it or someth
87250	0	a	I do not know .
87251	0	a	Becau I d , it was not my pen .
87252	1	a	Should we by the way draw on our nice whiteboard , a little idea of
87253	0	a	yeah .
87254	0	a	this kind of looks you like .
87255	0	a	Of the shape .
87256	0	a	Or the sh
87257	1	a	Do you get an idea of the shape ?
87258	0	a	A little bit bigger ,
87259	0	a	yeah
87260	0	a	but
87261	1	a	Oh , look look at the pictures .
87262	0	a	Yeah , probably , it would be nice .
87263	0	a	I dunno .
87264	1	a	Has anyone got a little bit detailed ideas about the shape ?
87265	0	a	I do not , for one .
87266	1	a	Maybe like this pen .
87267	0	a	A bit bigger I guess , but The shape is nice
87268	0	a	, it is something different , and we want we want that .
87269	0	a	No , bigger .
87270	0	a	Well , I I
87271	0	a	I have to say
87272	0	a	, I have this can opening remote control in my head most of all ,
87273	0	a	or I think some maybe
87274	0	a	we should
87275	0	a	no , that will be too costly .
87276	0	a	Yeah .
87277	0	a	We shou we could also ,
87278	0	a	that was a would also be an idea ,
87279	0	a	but I do not think it
87280	0	a	I do not know if it exists already ,
87281	1	a	you should like make Alessi or something design it .
87282	0	a	Okay , yeah .
87283	0	a	That would also be nice .
87284	0	a	But that is going to then you
87285	0	a	c then you do not
87286	0	a	Yeah , but then you do not have t
87287	0	a	yeah
87288	0	a	it that is not something
87289	0	a	i that is in the production cost a one it is a one time ,
87290	0	a	you know s was it is a single cost .
87291	0	a	Yeah , but twelve and a half Euros ?
87292	0	a	Yeah .
87293	0	a	Yeah , m
87294	0	a	but
87295	0	a	but then you can
87296	0	a	nah , I do not thin
87297	0	a	I think that it would be more expensive ,
87298	0	a	because I have bought the Alessi stuff more often and even small pencil holders or something are more expensive .
87299	0	a	Yeah , that is true .
87300	0	a	Would be a nice idea though .
87301	0	a	I do not know .
87302	1	a	I think it has to be a r it has to have round forms or something .
87303	1	a	Like something like that or so or so And on th and then s a base unit underneath it .
87304	0	a	Something like that is very ergonomic .
87305	0	a	So
87306	0	a	Yeah .
87307	1	a	It is also round .
87308	1	a	Put it in there wire on it .
87309	1	a	Maybe , I do not know , some some lights , a big but well .
87310	0	a	Yeah , flash lights at the side .
87311	1	a	Volume and programme , yeah .
87312	0	a	At the side , or something like that .
87313	0	a	Yes , volume and programme should be there I guess , because you hands wi y your hands will be in the smaller part .
87314	0	a	And some of the extra funct
87315	1	a	Some of the extra functions over here .
87316	0	a	Yeah .
87317	0	a	Yeah ,
87318	1	a	and the numbers on top , I guess .
87319	1	a	Numbers .
87320	0	a	Yeah .
87321	1	a	And and lights ?
87322	1	a	How we are g
87323	1	a	well , maybe s a ring of
87324	0	a	no , no , you have to
87325	1	a	Maybe on the side of it .
87326	0	a	Maybe ro roun rounds
87327	0	a	l sorry .
87328	0	a	Yeah , side of it .
87329	1	a	Along the side strip of yeah .
87330	1	a	Just two LEDs or something on the side .
87331	1	a	Maybe lights also around the volume and the p the plus minus programme buttons .
87332	1	a	Yeah .
87333	0	a	Yeah ,
87334	0	a	but I also meant the the blinking li w you know , the ones that also blink when you try to locate your remote .
87335	0	a	Oh .
87336	0	a	Okay .
87337	0	a	Yeah .
87338	0	a	Yeah .
87339	0	a	Well , theys have to be
87340	0	a	Yeah .
87341	1	a	Well , probably at the side .
87342	0	a	You know look at the front , but
87343	0	a	Yeah , exactly ,
87344	0	a	and then there is yeah .
87345	0	a	Yeah ,
87346	0	a	yeah .
87347	0	a	Exactly .
87348	0	a	When you you see it from the side , then it would look just like that .
87349	1	a	And then you have a strip of lights or something
87350	0	a	Yeah , something like that , yeah .
87351	0	a	Okay , yeah .
87352	0	a	Well , I think it is nice , for one thing .
87353	1	a	maybe put something on top of it or , you know , like that is looks funny .
87354	0	a	No .
87355	0	a	I do not know .
87356	0	a	No .
87357	1	a	Or some bump .
87358	0	a	I think I think that will be too big tha too big then .
87359	0	a	Maybe some
87360	0	a	Yeah ?
87361	1	a	We will have to think about it .
87362	1	a	Bumper or something .
87363	0	a	I think we are we are done .
87364	0	a	Yeah .
87365	0	a	Yeah .
87366	0	a	Yes , we are .
87367	0	a	We can save this one .
87368	0	a	Lunch break .
87369	0	a	Alright .
87370	0	a	Yes , I guess it is lunch time .
87371	0	a	Okay then .
87372	0	a	I do not know .
87373	0	a	Half and hour ?
87374	0	a	I thought our next next individual round was half an hour .
87375	0	a	Okay , five
87376	0	a	Oh .
87377	0	a	Yeah , that was what
87378	0	a	I do not know about the lunch break .
87379	0	a	 
87380	0	a	Okay , all set ?
87381	0	a	Welcome to the conceptual design meeting .
87382	0	a	, okay .
87383	0	a	Yes .
87384	0	a	The agenda .
87385	0	a	The opening .
87386	1	a	I will again be the secretary and make minutes , take minutes ,
87387	0	a	and it will be three presentations , just like the last meeting .
87388	1	a	So , who wants to start off ?
87389	1	a	Technical designer again ?
87390	0	a	Okay .
87391	1	a	Again .
87392	0	a	, yeah .
87393	0	a	, before we begin it , I want to say I have I have put the minutes of the second meeting in the shared folder , but they are still not quite okay .
87394	0	a	It it still some technical difficulties so the the first part of the minutes are very hard to read , because there are two documents that were layered over each other .
87395	0	a	Okay .
87396	0	a	So
87397	1	a	But , from now on I wo not use my pen anymore , so will be p just ordinary keyboard .
87398	0	a	, may be better , yeah .
87399	0	a	Keyboard work .
87400	0	a	I think it will will be more easy for you to read the minutes .
87401	0	a	Yeah .
87402	0	a	Yeah .
87403	0	a	Alright .
87404	0	a	Okay , when we talk about components design , it is really about the material and the and really the stuff we build the remote controls of .
87405	0	a	, a remote control consist of components and the components of a remote control consist of properties and material .
87406	1	a	We have to choose th these wisely
87407	0	a	and it could affect a kind of grow of in in buying the remote controls .
87408	0	a	, the components of a remote control are of course the case .
87409	0	a	the properties of the case , it has to be solid in hard material like hard plastic with soft rubber for falling and
87410	0	a	and yeah , it feels good in your hand .
87411	0	a	the buttons has to be solid too , and the material is soft rubber .
87412	0	a	I have got a email from the possibilities of Real Reaction .
87413	0	a	they are telling me that when we build a remote control of of plastic or rubber , the buttons have to be rubber too .
87414	0	a	It is okay .
87415	0	a	Yeah .
87416	0	a	I when we use a rubbled a doubled curved case , we must use a rubber push buttons to the the rubber double curved case is a is a t three dimensional curve in the in the design , which is necessary when we want to be trendy .
87417	0	a	the energy source , I have got a lot of possibilities for that too .
87418	0	a	Oh .
87419	0	a	the basic battery , which I thi prefer because of its its non non depending of of of here you have to have a hand
87420	0	a	yeah , kinetic energy .
87421	0	a	Also in this one , like in the watches , but a remote control can lie on a table for a day , and then you push a button and so you do not have to walk with it all the all the time .
87422	0	a	, solar cells are also a bit weird for remote controls .
87423	0	a	also the case material ,
87424	0	a	I think that plastic is the is the best with rubber , because wood or titanium would also be a bit weird .
87425	0	a	Oh titanium is probably trendy , I think .
87426	0	a	That is true , I guess .
87427	0	a	Yeah .
87428	0	a	Well , maybe a little bit expensive .
87429	0	a	I do not know .
87430	0	a	Huh .
87431	0	a	, they do not tell anything about the cost of titanium .
87432	0	a	the chip
87433	0	a	the chip set and the board is all off the shelf .
87434	0	a	Also , the speaker in the remote control , when we want to retrieve it .
87435	0	a	, the base station is also off the shelf , all the materials and the components are just available in in our factory .
87436	0	a	I have told about the three first points .
87437	0	a	, the simple electronical chip is is available with the LED transmitter transmitter .
87438	0	a	, it is all off the shelf and even the speaker and the wireless retriever are all available in our company .
87439	0	a	, another possibility .
87440	0	a	I
87441	0	a	yeah ,
87442	0	a	I looked up on was the LCD displays .
87443	0	a	Could be something special to our remote control , and it is possible , but it only cost a bit more , but maybe it can be within the limits of twenty five Euros .
87444	0	a	Twelve and a half .
87445	0	a	yeah .
87446	0	a	Actually
87447	0	a	What are those , t tooth brushes , or so
87448	0	a	But it is actually kind of
87449	0	a	well , it resembles the design I had in mind for this proj
87450	0	a	You know the the cartoonish Alessi kind of design .
87451	0	a	Yeah .
87452	0	a	Yeah , production cost .
87453	0	a	I th
87454	0	a	I got an email with some examples and it these were were the most trendiest one .
87455	0	a	You see a covers , which can be , I do not know .
87456	0	a	Yes .
87457	0	a	I
87458	1	a	Different colours also .
87459	0	a	Yep .
87460	1	a	Yes , maybe we can bri bring a couple of couple of types of maybe a kind of whole a whole set of different remote controls .
87461	0	a	And we can we can steal their ideas .
87462	1	a	Maybe we can bring a whole line with with a huge variety of house stuff .
87463	0	a	Huh .
87464	0	a	Well , it is a possibility , too .
87465	1	a	Like maybe radios and television also in this in this in the same style , but
87466	0	a	Yes ,
87467	1	a	because we have to we have to we have to bring the logo and all the stuff back into it .
87468	0	a	Uh uh .
87469	0	a	Yeah , that will be for the future , I guess .
87470	0	a	Okay .
87471	0	a	Next time we are here .
87472	0	a	Yeah .
87473	0	a	Yeah .
87474	0	a	Oh , okay .
87475	0	a	Yeah .
87476	0	a	Definitely .
87477	0	a	Okay .
87478	0	a	Thank you .
87479	0	a	Alright .
87480	0	a	Okay .
87481	0	a	Yeah .
87482	0	a	That is okay .
87483	1	a	Well , I shall go to the next slide .
87484	0	a	, I still do not have any information about user requirements .
87485	0	a	I was thinking about just the basic functions and I got
87486	0	a	Yeah ,
87487	0	a	but but then wh I do not know when there are new user requirements .
87488	0	a	Oh , we decided upon that in the last meeting .
87489	0	a	Did not we ?
87490	0	a	Oh , okay .
87491	0	a	I ha
87492	0	a	I
87493	0	a	ha I have the
87494	0	a	I have
87495	0	a	nothing .
87496	0	a	Well , tha I did not receive any new requirements or somethi
87497	0	a	Just
87498	0	a	no ,
87499	0	a	but we decided to use only b basic functions only .
87500	0	a	Well , I have here a couple of basic functions I could think of .
87501	0	a	Okay .
87502	0	a	I dunno if they are maybe a little bit more , but
87503	0	a	Yeah .
87504	1	a	Well we maybe we can think of that later .
87505	0	a	W just
87506	0	a	these are the ones you already summed up in the
87507	0	a	Okay .
87508	0	a	Yeah , I
87509	0	a	I
87510	0	a	well , I pointed them out here , just to make it a little bit easier .
87511	0	a	Another function is of course we already discuss it on the side .
87512	0	a	, I do not know what costs of it .
87513	0	a	, I have no idea about it .
87514	0	a	, I was also looking for what you said , for I got an email about LCD in in in front of the remote control .
87515	0	a	I do not know if that is a good idea , or maybe it is a little bit too much for twelve and a half .
87516	0	a	Production .
87517	0	a	Yeah .
87518	0	a	Uh huh .
87519	0	a	If we got already something like a base .
87520	0	a	That might get redundant also maybe .
87521	0	a	I do not know what kind of information
87522	0	a	it would
87523	0	a	Yeah .
87524	0	a	Yeah , I do not know .
87525	0	a	I
87526	0	a	d I ju
87527	0	a	I was just thinking about it .
87528	0	a	yeah .
87529	0	a	Then I got a pop ups to go to the meeting .
87530	0	a	Yeah , it is okay .
87531	1	a	Maybe we can bring t teletext to the t to the remote control .
87532	0	a	But
87533	0	a	The remote control .
87534	0	a	a little too A little bit
87535	0	a	A little bit too big , I think .
87536	0	a	Then you
87537	0	a	and then you have got a flag
87538	0	a	s Very big RC .
87539	0	a	Okay .
87540	0	a	That is not
87541	0	a	It was not a good idea .
87542	0	a	Yeah .
87543	0	a	Exactly .
87544	0	a	Okay .
87545	0	a	, yeah .
87546	0	a	Well , the functions are are not more to discuss , I think .
87547	0	a	No .
87548	0	a	It is it is just the base things we already discussed that the no VCR or that kind of
87549	0	a	, so that is very easy .
87550	0	a	No .
87551	0	a	No .
87552	0	a	But you do mention the next and previous button .
87553	0	a	Next channel , previous channel .
87554	0	a	Well , that is next channel .
87555	0	a	Oh , okay ,
87556	0	a	o okay
87557	0	a	okay .
87558	0	a	I mean next channel .
87559	0	a	oh , I
87560	0	a	I got an email with with an a remote control with a base .
87561	0	a	Huh .
87562	0	a	So , it is just an idea .
87563	0	a	And I thinked of the button sizes and I am not sure if they have to be big or just small
87564	0	a	Well , I am not a e
87565	0	a	I am the expert for user friendly , but not for trendiness .
87566	0	a	But you are the expert .
87567	0	a	I think it depends on the function .
87568	0	a	Maybe it
87569	0	a	Well
87570	0	a	okay , that is your point .
87571	0	a	Well , if you save Perhaps s tiny buttons are not user friendly
87572	0	a	, then we would not im implement that of course .
87573	0	a	, yeah .
87574	0	a	Yeah , okay .
87575	0	a	Yeah , I have nothing to s
87576	0	a	, with a little bit larger , yeah .
87577	0	a	Well , w when we only use basic functions , we have the possibility to make the buttons larger .
87578	0	a	Oh , that is right .
87579	0	a	Yeah .
87580	0	a	I thought so , but maybe with the Yeah , that groups .
87581	0	a	Well , I think we already agreed upon the fact that the the the skip buttons and the cha and the volume buttons , th th those two have
87582	0	a	yeah ,
87583	0	a	they have to be large .
87584	0	a	, I mean th th the the two two basic buttons , you know , the to skip channels and to
87585	0	a	I think
87586	0	a	yeah ,
87587	0	a	I do not know why , but I think that is that is t trendy too ,
87588	0	a	because that is the mo
87589	0	a	it
87590	0	a	it you know , it is acc acc accentu ,
87591	0	a	how do you say it ?
87592	0	a	It puts an extra accent on the the on the simplicity of our remotes to j to make these two most basic functions extra big , like t
87593	0	a	Yeah .
87594	0	a	Large ?
87595	0	a	Yeah .
87596	0	a	Yep .
87597	0	a	Most the most used buttons .
87598	0	a	Those are probably the the th
87599	0	a	Yes .
87600	0	a	True .
87601	0	a	Yeah .
87602	0	a	Those are probably the b four most most used buttons on the th in the remote control .
87603	0	a	You did the research .
87604	1	a	And you want to acc accentuate that , you know .
87605	0	a	Yeah .
87606	0	a	Sorry ?
87607	0	a	Yeah , sure .
87608	0	a	It is from your research .
87609	0	a	Okay .
87610	0	a	So
87611	0	a	Okay .
87612	0	a	, that was all y personal preference I did not have .
87613	0	a	I did not had any time left .
87614	0	a	No , that is coo it is cool .
87615	0	a	You do not care .
87616	0	a	No , sorry .
87617	0	a	Yeah .
87618	0	a	Oh .
87619	0	a	Go away .
87620	0	a	Come on .
87621	0	a	It is there .
87622	1	a	Yeah , click on it .
87623	0	a	Couple time .
87624	0	a	Oh , great .
87625	0	a	Well , I have done some research again about trends on the internet .
87626	0	a	I have done some investigation , and well I got some information from fashion watchers from Paris and Milan .
87627	0	a	Some some findings the most important thing is fancy look and feel of the remote control .
87628	0	a	, well , we were going to imply that , so that is nice .
87629	0	a	The second important thing is innovative technology in the RC .
87630	0	a	, our market really likes really likes that .
87631	0	a	And the third point there in this order if of importance , the third point , is a high ease of use .
87632	0	a	And , well , for the idea , I have put some trends for the market of elderly people .
87633	0	a	Dark colours , simple recognisable shapes .
87634	1	a	So we probably wo not do that .
87635	0	a	The younger market likes
87636	0	a	Well , the themes of of this year are surprisingly fruits and vegetables and spongy material .
87637	0	a	I found this image , which is
87638	0	a	Well , it symbolises the idea of fruits and vegetables .
87639	0	a	I do not see the spongy part in it .
87640	0	a	But with a little bit of fancy
87641	0	a	Exactly .
87642	0	a	Well maybe c then we have to do something with Sponge Bob then .
87643	0	a	I got some ideas well , yeah , pictures is not really good word , but some symbols of fruits or vegetables maybe .
87644	0	a	, catchy colours .
87645	0	a	Fruit is yellow , green , red , whatever .
87646	0	a	So , remote controls in in catchy colours .
87647	0	a	It does not stroke with the with the dark colours .
87648	0	a	, no , we do not want dark colours .
87649	0	a	Not the dark colours ?
87650	0	a	Okay .
87651	0	a	No , I just put them there to , yeah , for general idea .
87652	0	a	Okay .
87653	0	a	And , the docking st
87654	0	a	I think the spongy material is is very irritating for the remote control itself .
87655	0	a	But to
87656	0	a	Yeah , the
87657	1	a	To implement some spongy thing , maybe we can do it in the in the docking station .
87658	1	a	At the bottom of the docking station or whatever .
87659	1	a	And , we could bring one line with a dark colour to p yeah
87660	0	a	v how do you say ?
87661	0	a	Yeah , also a bit for elderly people who are a little bit crazy and want maybe want a little younger design but still the dark colour .
87662	0	a	For diversity or something .
87663	0	a	No ,
87664	0	a	but I I
87665	0	a	I think that our design already resembles so a piece of fruit .
87666	0	a	Well , how
87667	1	a	But how do we use fruits and vegetables in Christ is sake with remote control ?
87668	1	a	, make it a banana ?
87669	0	a	Yeah , but th
87670	0	a	yeah ,
87671	0	a	but that
87672	0	a	Yeah ,
87673	0	a	but that is
87674	0	a	Yeah
87675	1	a	But d do not we need a creative artist or something like that to m make it to feel like a a a a vegetable or fruit ?
87676	0	a	Yeah .
87677	0	a	I mean it
87678	0	a	it
87679	0	a	it reaches a different market , but it it it does not cost really much effort to b to bring like a black RC on the market or whatever .
87680	0	a	Yes .
87681	0	a	Yeah , there is there is always a
87682	0	a	Well there there is always empty space of course on a remote control .
87683	0	a	It is like a pear or something .
87684	0	a	I mean I think this part of the RC
87685	0	a	well the upper the upper part or whatever is is not not used with buttons , I guess .
87686	0	a	No , I do not think you have to do it like
87687	0	a	Yeah , but it that does not have to remind you , you know , like explicitly of s our f of a of a specific piece of fruit , but just , you know , like the the the the round curves .
87688	1	a	So you you can put some fruity things
87689	0	a	No , of course not .
87690	0	a	And so y
87691	0	a	I
87692	0	a	I think this
87693	0	a	y
87694	0	a	it already sem resembles something like a pear to me or something .
87695	0	a	Especially i
87696	0	a	Yeah ,
87697	0	a	yeah .
87698	0	a	Yeah , exactly .
87699	1	a	If we make it little bit greenish .
87700	0	a	Yeah .
87701	0	a	You do get the idea , eh ?
87702	0	a	The fruity kind of round
87703	0	a	Kay .
87704	1	a	A and we could use one of these for
87705	0	a	the w what is it ?
87706	0	a	Is not
87707	0	a	Wha whatever .
87708	0	a	Yeah ,
87709	0	a	yeah ,
87710	0	a	I do not know .
87711	0	a	Grapes .
87712	0	a	, this is a b
87713	0	a	yeah .
87714	0	a	Yeah ,
87715	0	a	yeah .
87716	0	a	Of course we have
87717	0	a	we have a very big the s
87718	0	a	Of d design team , yeah .
87719	0	a	Yeah , sure .
87720	0	a	Yeah .
87721	1	a	Well , w we can w
87722	1	a	we can we can produce multiple multiple things .
87723	0	a	For a big team of artists .
87724	0	a	This is then the pear .
87725	0	a	I do not know the English word , so forget it .
87726	0	a	Yeah , but
87727	0	a	It is pear , I guess .
87728	0	a	And , maybe , yeah , a b a banana is is n not easy for a remote control , but m
87729	0	a	yeah .
87730	0	a	But but I think we do not have to make
87731	0	a	we ca not make all ten designs .
87732	0	a	No .
87733	1	a	We have to make one design
87734	1	a	I th
87735	1	a	I
87736	1	a	I think .
87737	0	a	No ,
87738	0	a	but I think it is it is already what we were were up to .
87739	1	a	Mayb maybe two or three .
87740	1	a	, it is it does not have to resemble what I already said , a specific piece of fruit , but just , you know , like a fruity thing going on .
87741	0	a	Yeah .
87742	0	a	No sure ,
87743	0	a	but but
87744	0	a	B but that is great ,
87745	0	a	and and and what I was
87746	0	a	what what I was saying , the catchy colours
87747	0	a	Yeah .
87748	0	a	And it is it looks fruity to me .
87749	0	a	And , but I do like the
87750	0	a	yeah , I do like the f to the idea of making a a y , a catchy colour design and a d because I do I think a dark colour would be nice too .
87751	0	a	But pictures of fruit , vegetables vegetables
87752	1	a	Yes , you can put a logo on top of it .
87753	0	a	Maybe it is too much , you know .
87754	0	a	But , we we have to There have to be the the the the firm colours , our own colours has to be in it .
87755	0	a	Yeah , not really .
87756	0	a	Pictures was a was a bad word , but
87757	0	a	Well we c yeah .
87758	0	a	Okay , but what are the
87759	0	a	This is yellow .
87760	0	a	Yellow , a Real Reaction .
87761	0	a	Yeah , sure .
87762	0	a	But I do not think our our company colours are this fashionable .
87763	0	a	, yeah .
87764	1	a	Maybe we can if if we got our docking station over here .
87765	0	a	Yes , it is really fruity .
87766	0	a	We f
87767	0	a	A yellow do
87768	0	a	, yeah .
87769	0	a	I ca not draw with this thing ,
87770	1	a	but I will try .
87771	1	a	If this is our docking station , we can make our logo over here .
87772	0	a	It does not work .
87773	0	a	And then
87774	1	a	Well , the button button over here or whatever ,
87775	0	a	I do not know .
87776	1	a	Yeah , and the button then .
87777	1	a	With a strawberry on top .
87778	0	a	Yeah ,
87779	0	a	on n on the bottom of the remote you can do
87780	0	a	Okay .
87781	0	a	Okay , yeah .
87782	1	a	On the front , of course ,
87783	0	a	because else you ca not find it .
87784	0	a	Okay .
87785	0	a	Well , that were my ideas a little bit .
87786	1	a	I will close them down .
87787	0	a	, go away .
87788	1	a	Okay , you can you open the conceptual design presentation ?
87789	1	a	See what was on the agenda .
87790	1	a	Conceptual design , yes .
87791	0	a	Lazy .
87792	0	a	The agenda .
87793	0	a	This is his own remote .
87794	1	a	Because , maybe we can start with the technical functions ,
87795	0	a	but I do not think it is there
87796	0	a	, yeah ,
87797	1	a	do we want to use an LCD display , for example ?
87798	0	a	Me neither .
87799	0	a	Yeah .
87800	0	a	Well , it is nice , of course .
87801	0	a	Only if we
87802	1	a	Maybe maybe we can make a TV guide on it , for the channel you are on .
87803	0	a	But I do not I do not know what to display on it .
87804	0	a	I mean
87805	0	a	Yeah , but it should be li like this big , and I do not think Yes sure , but it it has to to show an entire title of a programme or at least a q a quite quite large part of it
87806	0	a	and then you get a very large LCD screen , because Yeah , I do not know .
87807	0	a	Yeah , but it is so
87808	0	a	I do not think we should do it .
87809	0	a	No , no , only the TV channel with the with with four programmes .
87810	1	a	You can zap through them with the page up page down button .
87811	0	a	Yes , it can
87812	0	a	On your
87813	0	a	No , on your mobile phone you can y you can read text also .
87814	0	a	So why not on your remote ?
87815	1	a	, programme information or or or or g or a guide
87816	0	a	on t on teletext , yes .
87817	0	a	Yeah , but no .
87818	0	a	I do I think it is a bit redundant , actually .
87819	0	a	And it is also not I do not th even think it
87820	0	a	it looks s like sexy or something ,
87821	0	a	it is
87822	0	a	But you are already watching the TV , you are not going to watch your remote control .
87823	1	a	Well well what would you display on it then ?
87824	0	a	But is it is not that a already on TV , a lot of new TVs ?
87825	0	a	Yeah .
87826	1	a	Programme information .
87827	0	a	But
87828	0	a	Well a lot a lot of TVs indeed show when you zap to a
87829	0	a	But then we also w need to bring out a line of TVs
87830	0	a	which we were planning to ,
87831	0	a	but whatever .
87832	0	a	Also on the internet .
87833	0	a	But
87834	0	a	Yes , but you also want to know what is next .
87835	0	a	Yeah ,
87836	0	a	and we also have to
87837	0	a	yeah .
87838	0	a	Because the TV has to send information back to the RC , and I do not know if that is possible .
87839	0	a	Yes , that is really possible .
87840	0	a	Yes , yes , o of course it is possible , but you gotta implement it in the TVs , and I do not think everyone is going to buy a Real Reaction TV within a month after the release of our remote control .
87841	0	a	And I also
87842	0	a	Yeah , I dunno .
87843	0	a	I really understand you want to make your job more exciting by putting an LCD in it , but I I really do not think it is a good n goo
87844	0	a	because it also does not stroke with we wanted c
87845	0	a	When we talk about the materials , it is a good idea to use these plastic materials with soft rubber stuff on it .
87846	0	a	It was our idea , you know , to give it a more sturdy look and that you ca like you can throw with it .
87847	0	a	Yeah .
87848	0	a	But I do not think a LCD display fits in that image .
87849	0	a	You know , it is like more vulnerable , and it adds nothing really , you know .
87850	0	a	That is true , that is true , it breaks f
87851	0	a	yeah ,
87852	0	a	it it
87853	0	a	it is not very solid , it is frag fragile .
87854	0	a	Yeah ,
87855	0	a	yeah .
87856	0	a	You could make it , but it is just it
87857	0	a	it does not I do not think it it is coherent with the design we are after .
87858	0	a	No .
87859	0	a	No .
87860	0	a	I do not think so ei either .
87861	0	a	But that is my opinion .
87862	0	a	Well , you you y
87863	1	a	Okay , we can vote for it .
87864	0	a	You want the LCD display .
87865	0	a	No .
87866	0	a	I do not want to and he does not , so it is up to him .
87867	0	a	If we want to
87868	0	a	And I have read somewhere that I have got some kind of veto veto rights .
87869	0	a	Oh , okay .
87870	0	a	Bastard .
87871	0	a	So I can also say But did we skip the
87872	0	a	Yeah , you could do
87873	0	a	m but what what i
87874	0	a	so what
87875	0	a	i but do you think we should
87876	0	a	We are not even sure what what information we want to display on it .
87877	0	a	We can you away .
87878	0	a	Yeah , I do not know .
87879	0	a	, I i if it is it is a simple p
87880	0	a	No , that that is right ,
87881	1	a	and I also have to think about new functions , maybe buttons or something like that to control it .
87882	0	a	No
87883	0	a	Y yes , you can use buttons w that are already on the remote control for double functions .
87884	0	a	So
87885	0	a	Nah , that is not going to work .
87886	0	a	Kind of LCD or something or
87887	0	a	But how does it display then ?
87888	0	a	W when I go to the second channel ,
87889	0	a	what what does it show me ?
87890	0	a	About that programme ?
87891	0	a	Yeah .
87892	0	a	Yeah , I guess .
87893	0	a	, then you push a button .
87894	0	a	The title and the information about the programme .
87895	0	a	But but
87896	0	a	yeah , what he said was right , about the televisions , they have to be customised to the
87897	0	a	But maybe in future it will be a giant hit , and when you are the first
87898	0	a	you have the biggest
87899	0	a	Yes , you can put a little LCD display on it with with lots of information .
87900	0	a	No .
87901	0	a	Yeah .
87902	0	a	Oh , well I have seen it done before .
87903	0	a	Do you know th like the the bigger rem universal remotes , they have d LCD displays ,
87904	0	a	but then it is very functional to indicate which what device you are controlling .
87905	0	a	So it is that that is what I have seen .
87906	0	a	Yeah , that is true ,
87907	0	a	if you
87908	0	a	Yeah .
87909	0	a	But it just it j it does not does not match with the our whole basic concept .
87910	0	a	But I have not thought about it .
87911	0	a	But whe but when you put a a a transparent plastic screen on top of it , it i it is not vulnerable .
87912	0	a	Well yeah , yeah
87913	0	a	, okay .
87914	0	a	You can throw with it and When when you put maybe a colour LCD t screen on it , it is very special and very trendy to have a remote control from
87915	0	a	But I have got a the email with with the possibilities .
87916	0	a	That is maybe not the most important ,
87917	0	a	but it is just
87918	0	a	I do not think so .
87919	0	a	Is it fashion ?
87920	0	a	I do not know .
87921	0	a	That is not up to you .
87922	0	a	That is up to market if i if it is trendy .
87923	0	a	Yeah , well do you ha do you have to
87924	0	a	You have not looked after the trendiness of LCD displays , have you ?
87925	0	a	Yeah
87926	0	a	yeah
87927	0	a	yeah .
87928	0	a	No .
87929	0	a	Because our our motto is we put fashion
87930	0	a	Yeah , if you want to be trendy you have to be coloured .
87931	0	a	Well , I think it is
87932	0	a	I think it is pretty trendy , to be honest ,
87933	0	a	but I do not know if if if
87934	0	a	well , I am coming back to the costs again , but I think we gotta build a b pretty cheap design to to stay within our limits .
87935	0	a	And I think especially colour LCD , which is indeed pretty trendy .
87936	0	a	But I do not think , I think it will be too expensive .
87937	0	a	And LCD was a possibility for the remote control .
87938	1	a	So why do not we use it .
87939	0	a	, did it say a price also for for monogramme LCD or coloured LCD ?
87940	0	a	Yeah really ,
87941	0	a	if y if you c
87942	0	a	i
87943	0	a	I in in two thousand and four you ca not put something on the market which is a monogramme .
87944	0	a	Yeah , but we are going to if it
87945	0	a	Then then you better do not yeah , d
87946	0	a	I really do not feel the whole idea of an LCD display .
87947	0	a	Coloured
87948	0	a	If you have black and white or something , or grey , that is It is too much maybe with with the LCD and the docking station and
87949	1	a	With one thing special .
87950	0	a	Really .
87951	0	a	No , but it does not sa say anything about a colour or
87952	0	a	But , , I alf
87953	0	a	I also got a possibility to put a scroll button on it .
87954	0	a	But I did not think that
87955	0	a	Yes , but o on the No , when y But it look
87956	0	a	Yes , but that remote controls are already on the market .
87957	0	a	I am sorry .
87958	0	a	It ca not co you cannot convince me .
87959	0	a	I do not know how well how to with you guys , but
87960	0	a	I do not really feel it .
87961	0	a	We already we are
87962	0	a	Yeah , we already have the the th th th base station gadgets ,
87963	0	a	and want and it , do
87964	1	a	it has to be a simple design , which sturdy , which soft
87965	0	a	I do not think
87966	0	a	I j ,
87967	0	a	and really , I do not see how the the LCD display is going to add anything , you know , on a design level .
87968	0	a	Yeah .
87969	1	a	W we have we have gotta find a balance , of course .
87970	0	a	And I think
87971	0	a	We have a pear .
87972	1	a	Not a whole package of specialty .
87973	0	a	, I think it is slicker to have no L CEDs .
87974	0	a	Y we want to
87975	0	a	it is simplicity , w you have two big buttons and you can do whatever you want with these two buttons , so you do not need an LCD .
87976	0	a	It does not fit in our philosophy behind the whole remote .
87977	0	a	The simple Yes , but but when you want to have something special
87978	0	a	Yes ,
87979	0	a	but you had a picture of it from another company .
87980	0	a	Yeah , but we already have the docking station , which is It has to be developed ,
87981	0	a	but no , but it that is
87982	0	a	that is our that is our killer feature .
87983	0	a	And the
87984	0	a	Yeah .
87985	0	a	It is just an it is just an idea .
87986	0	a	That is our what makes it special .
87987	0	a	It is a it is
87988	0	a	True .
87989	0	a	Yes , it was already made .
87990	0	a	Tha the remote control on the docking station .
87991	1	a	Yeah , we are going to develop our own r n docking station .
87992	0	a	Is that so ?
87993	0	a	Was it
87994	0	a	it was not just a prototype ?
87995	0	a	Exactly ,
87996	0	a	I have never seen it in a store .
87997	0	a	Yes , he have a picture of it .
87998	0	a	Well I
87999	0	a	Yeah , I dunno .
88000	1	a	, but re we really have to cut this off ,
88001	0	a	I re I know you
88002	0	a	I
88003	0	a	I
88004	0	a	I
88005	0	a	I
88006	0	a	I get the idea you really like it , you know , the the LCD thing , but I I think it is it is not a good idea , and we have already mentioned all the arguments .
88007	0	a	I do not ,
88008	0	a	do you guys agre How do you guys think ?
88009	0	a	I d
88010	1	a	Okay , we s skip the LCD display .
88011	0	a	No , it is too much .
88012	0	a	I think it is a little too much ,
88013	0	a	yeah .
88014	0	a	It is overdone .
88015	0	a	Okay .
88016	0	a	Okay .
88017	0	a	I am sorry , maybe you can do something if we are at your own place , or make it make it make it happen in your basement or something .
88018	0	a	Democratically .
88019	0	a	No .
88020	0	a	Mayb
88021	0	a	I will rule the world with it .
88022	0	a	But
88023	0	a	Probably so .
88024	0	a	Yeah ,
88025	0	a	yeah ,
88026	0	a	yeah ,
88027	0	a	yeah .
88028	0	a	Okay .
88029	0	a	But for the technical part .
88030	0	a	The m material , I think it was a good idea to use the plastic and the rubber .
88031	0	a	Yes , maybe a bit of a cushion is
88032	0	a	Yes .
88033	0	a	Yeah
88034	0	a	yeah
88035	0	a	yeah , p
88036	0	a	Exactly .
88037	0	a	This is what it w
88038	0	a	Yeah ,
88039	0	a	but it
88040	0	a	it was already what we are
88041	0	a	we are after , you know , to give it , you know , the soft touch in your hands
88042	0	a	and also to , know , like
88043	0	a	Yeah , that is y the b airbag kind of thing .
88044	0	a	Yeah , for the spongy feel .
88045	0	a	With a spongy Bob feel .
88046	0	a	Yeah .
88047	0	a	Yeah .
88048	0	a	Like a b
88049	0	a	yes .
88050	0	a	You can st throw it at your little brother is head .
88051	0	a	Yeah , you just can drop it .
88052	0	a	Yeah , airbag .
88053	0	a	Yeah .
88054	0	a	If you drop it if you drop it the airbag comes out , yeah .
88055	0	a	Yeah .
88056	0	a	Yeah .
88057	0	a	No no no , not that comfy .
88058	0	a	Maybe it
88059	0	a	but then we have to look that it w will not be too childish to see .
88060	0	a	Yeah yeah .
88061	0	a	Yeah .
88062	0	a	Okay , that is a that is a good point .
88063	0	a	And that is why I like the dark t col dark colour bit , you know ,
88064	0	a	because it may be the design , it is maybe it is a bit of the
88065	0	a	it is a bit nineties maybe , what we are what we are up to rat fun to this point .
88066	0	a	Yeah .
88067	0	a	But not black I think .
88068	0	a	No .
88069	0	a	Well if if it is fruit and vegetables , it have to be colourful .
88070	0	a	Yeah , that is that is true , but but it has to be a little big solid .
88071	0	a	Yeah , b yeah , that is what w
88072	0	a	I I was pointing at .
88073	0	a	But can we ge
88074	1	a	Can we combine it or something ? with yellow and black ?
88075	1	a	Make it a bee ?
88076	0	a	A bee .
88077	0	a	It must not be too , n you know , th too overwhelming ,
88078	0	a	then when you put it on your just
88079	0	a	Yeah .
88080	0	a	Yeah , maybe so .
88081	0	a	What ?
88082	0	a	Oh , a bee .
88083	0	a	Oh .
88084	0	a	No , I do not like the yellow and black combination .
88085	0	a	But it is our company colours .
88086	0	a	Yes , real real good colours .
88087	0	a	Apparently .
88088	0	a	Yeah , it is our yeah .
88089	0	a	We we have to use yellow .
88090	0	a	Yeah .
88091	0	a	I do not like yellow ,
88092	0	a	and maybe I do not know .
88093	1	a	Well , we can as as I draw really nicely over there .
88094	0	a	But that is not really fruity .
88095	1	a	We can put the logo on our on our base station .
88096	1	a	, yeah .
88097	1	a	And maybe very very tiny on the remote control itself .
88098	0	a	But
88099	0	a	Okay , but what , what are other tef technical things we have to discuss ?
88100	0	a	Should we do that ?
88101	0	a	I do not think you we should do that .
88102	0	a	But , i
88103	0	a	Yeah .
88104	0	a	fronts
88105	0	a	of the
88106	1	a	We can have different fronts of the telephone .
88107	1	a	Maybe just bring it out in different colours ,
88108	0	a	but not af that you can switch fronts afterwards , that is also too much .
88109	0	a	Different fronts .
88110	0	a	I guess that is that is enough .
88111	0	a	People do not want to spend more money on their remote control , I guess .
88112	0	a	That is way too Nokia .
88113	0	a	Yeah .
88114	1	a	, you can you can l let choose the customer which colour he wants , yeah .
88115	0	a	Are these designs ?
88116	0	a	Yes .
88117	0	a	Yeah ,
88118	0	a	yeah .
88119	0	a	Yeah , definitely .
88120	1	a	Yeah , Three three or four four colours , or something like that .
88121	0	a	Just bring more designs on the market .
88122	0	a	But , without gon
88123	0	a	okay .
88124	0	a	Why not
88125	0	a	, yeah .
88126	0	a	So , are we through the technical part then ?
88127	0	a	Okay .
88128	0	a	So we agreed upon n well , not u unanimously or how you call it , but
88129	0	a	Yeah .
88130	0	a	It this a real young young and dynamic styles .
88131	0	a	Well , yeah ,
88132	0	a	the
88133	0	a	Three to one .
88134	0	a	That is
88135	0	a	And tita titanium , is is is it a no ?
88136	0	a	Is
88137	0	a	It is just like that , th this titanium .
88138	0	a	The materials you mentioned in your your personal preferences were all were quite okay .
88139	0	a	Yes .
88140	0	a	O o only only the last point
88141	0	a	your
88142	0	a	no titanium is not not out of question , I guess .
88143	0	a	Yes ,
88144	0	a	But also w
88145	0	a	Yes , b bu but when we use s soft
88146	0	a	But is it possible to use both the the plastic and so soft things and t p titanium , as well ?
88147	0	a	Makes it in a homogeneous design .
88148	0	a	Sure .
88149	0	a	No , not all , not all of them .
88150	0	a	But it it then it
88151	0	a	you ca not throw it it .
88152	0	a	It will make a huge noise or break other stuff when you throw with titanium with your remote control .
88153	0	a	It will it will break other stuff w when it is plastic , as well .
88154	0	a	No ,
88155	0	a	titanium is a bit it is a bit harder .
88156	0	a	Yeah .
88157	0	a	Yeah , that is true .
88158	0	a	No , but , you should ma
88159	0	a	Yeah .
88160	0	a	But also on the colours , the young
88161	0	a	Yes , but a titanium remote control , when you are watching TV or your hands are a little bit sweaty , and the Yes .
88162	0	a	Okay , think of the possibilities and make it in completely titanium .
88163	0	a	Well would it be more trendy ?
88164	0	a	More chic ?
88165	0	a	Yeah ,
88166	0	a	but I I really like the idea of the the the plastic and the big kind of thing .
88167	0	a	Yeah , I think it
88168	0	a	I think it does .
88169	0	a	, I think titanium nowadays is way more often used than plastic .
88170	0	a	In trendy things .
88171	0	a	Yeah , o
88172	0	a	On the other hand , if you want to make fruit fruity stuff with
88173	0	a	Yeah , that is true , that is true .
88174	0	a	Yeah .
88175	0	a	It is cold in the winter .
88176	0	a	Yeah .
88177	0	a	But the question is i then it is , you know , is is it fits in our s philosophy to make it sturdy and simple and , know ,
88178	0	a	like When you make it titanium , it becomes more like some kind of gadget you actually do not need .
88179	0	a	Sports and gaming .
88180	0	a	Define
88181	0	a	And when it is big and plastic , it is like some fun stuff you can always have around .
88182	0	a	It is always fun to have something big and plastic around .
88183	0	a	Yes .
88184	0	a	You have that MP three player of Nike , I saw .
88185	0	a	Yeah .
88186	0	a	Is not that titanium with a little bit of rubber ?
88187	0	a	Is not it
88188	0	a	Is plastic ?
88189	0	a	Well , it is titanium looking .
88190	0	a	Yes , it is w
88191	0	a	but it is plastic .
88192	1	a	Yes , w we can do that on the on the
88193	1	a	We can make this as a style too .
88194	0	a	What ?
88195	0	a	Oh , yeah .
88196	0	a	Yeah , he is .
88197	0	a	Here he is .
88198	0	a	, the I do not know if you know the MP three player of Nike .
88199	0	a	Kay , that that is very with rubber , so it is very rough .
88200	0	a	Okay , yeah .
88201	0	a	Yeah , that is beautiful .
88202	0	a	Yeah , I see .
88203	0	a	Yeah ,
88204	0	a	but but
88205	0	a	but
88206	0	a	Yeah ,
88207	0	a	I th
88208	0	a	I think that is difficult ,
88209	0	a	because that is different material , and then you gotta have like two material lines of of of
88210	0	a	Yeah , if it is just a colour which you which you change then , I guess it is it is nice to have one of these .
88211	0	a	, this is just a
88212	0	a	No , we c we can make it from the same kind of plastic .
88213	0	a	Oh , maybe th maybe this is an
88214	0	a	No , I do like the idea of maybe a t titanium kind type of body w and then with s plastic colouration around it .
88215	0	a	Yeah .
88216	0	a	I do not have the information .
88217	0	a	You know , like the the soft stuff , but I do not know if it is possible .
88218	0	a	, I I did not got it
88219	0	a	Yes .
88220	1	a	But you ca not make the plastic give the ti titanium look .
88221	0	a	True .
88222	1	a	But make it just like shiny .
88223	0	a	Yeah yeah , true .
88224	0	a	Maybe we should shou
88225	0	a	And and maybe we sh should we t
88226	0	a	I do not know if we should talk about ,
88227	0	a	how how much time have we got left ?
88228	0	a	Forty minutes .
88229	0	a	Like the MP three player .
88230	0	a	Yeah , maybe that is good idea ,
88231	0	a	yeah .
88232	0	a	But if you want to la
88233	0	a	yeah ,
88234	0	a	last longer than two weeks or something like that , you can maybe
88235	0	a	I do not know .
88236	0	a	Yeah .
88237	0	a	, in a lot of other
88238	0	a	in a lot of other product categories like even in b in bags industry .
88239	0	a	What time does
88240	0	a	The rubber .
88241	0	a	, they began with t typical leather bags , but then they became stylish , with all all si all sort of colours , and w kind of fon of of fronts , like we can use on the telephone and it Like Eastpack began a revolution with it with all this kind of bags and and colours and and
88242	0	a	Yes , and and styles .
88243	0	a	Yeah .
88244	0	a	Okay .
88245	0	a	You putting in different colours .
88246	0	a	Okay .
88247	0	a	They have also a kind of roses on it ,
88248	0	a	a and
88249	1	a	Then we can always use the same design for a greater resemblance , but with new with new colours , new
88250	0	a	yes .
88251	0	a	yeah ,
88252	0	a	yeah .
88253	0	a	Okay .
88254	0	a	Yeah ,
88255	0	a	but w yeah .
88256	0	a	Well , it is .
88257	0	a	It is a possibility .
88258	1	a	But , let is think about the bas
88259	0	a	Yes .
88260	1	a	New prints on it .
88261	1	a	Yep .
88262	1	a	But wha th our basic idea
88263	1	a	y
88264	1	a	I mean , you going to we are probably going to have like two type of materials , like the d d b the plastic enclosure and then the the pads that surround it .
88265	1	a	And and pro and lights .
88266	1	a	We have to incorporate the lights too .
88267	1	a	But , do w going to going to are we going to give it a two tone colour look , like the the plastic mould is in in one colour and the s the cushion pads around it are in another colour ?
88268	0	a	Is that the idea ?
88269	0	a	Is that a good idea ?
88270	0	a	How many colours are we how many colours are we going to we are f f
88271	0	a	Only five minutes left , by the way .
88272	0	a	How do you mean ?
88273	0	a	Th th the base in a in another
88274	0	a	Yes .
88275	1	a	How many colours are we going to give it ?
88276	1	a	Like two tone colour ?
88277	1	a	T
88278	1	a	I think maybe the case itself should be in one colour and then the rubber of the buttons , and the cushions as well should be in another colour .
88279	0	a	There there are three components three components type .
88280	1	a	Yeah .
88281	1	a	no , not too much I think .
88282	0	a	You have the buttons , the the case itself , and the rubber and th
88283	0	a	Yes .
88284	0	a	How the buttons
88285	0	a	yeah .
88286	1	a	Or you just make one colour , maybe with a a z a kind of
88287	1	a	like a big wave or something like In in another colour .
88288	0	a	Yeah .
88289	0	a	Okay , but not more than
88290	0	a	Well , yeah , it is
88291	0	a	No .
88292	0	a	Not more than two colours I think .
88293	0	a	No , definitely not .
88294	0	a	It is a g a little bit too flashy .
88295	1	a	Maybe we should talk about it on a l in a later meeting .
88296	0	a	Yes , definitely .
88297	1	a	Yeah , or or when you use the buttons as black , it you can use two colours as well
88298	0	a	But then you have to put up and down and left and right
88299	0	a	Okay .
88300	0	a	Okay .
88301	1	a	But we have to think of some other important things .
88302	0	a	oh yeah , the the functionalities of the the buttons .
88303	0	a	The funct
88304	0	a	yeah ,
88305	0	a	I was I was thinking about th
88306	0	a	the st do we still want a joystick idea .
88307	0	a	No .
88308	0	a	No , I think that is too vulnerable .
88309	0	a	Yeah .
88310	0	a	I think this is okay ,
88311	0	a	the
88312	0	a	so we have the basic .
88313	0	a	Then we have the numbers .
88314	0	a	We have the power button .
88315	0	a	We have we have a teletext button .
88316	0	a	The volume , teletext and
88317	0	a	Yeah
88318	0	a	yeah
88319	0	a	yeah
88320	0	a	yeah ,
88321	0	a	b
88322	0	a	Yeah , but wha what kind of menu ?
88323	0	a	Is is not that different from every television ?
88324	0	a	Mute .
88325	1	a	And maybe want to access a a menu or something .
88326	0	a	Yeah , but that is that is
88327	0	a	I was thinking that is gotta be on the television .
88328	0	a	Most TVs have a menu .
88329	0	a	Yeah ,
88330	0	a	but I think you ha I really need a menu button .
88331	0	a	That is just i the only button only You know , I
88332	0	a	No , I think most TVs have an a menu nowadays to access the screen settings .
88333	0	a	Yeah , if it is c if
88334	0	a	Yeah , I think it is okay to to add a menu button for
88335	0	a	and if the TV does not have a menu , then
88336	0	a	Yeah .
88337	0	a	And so
88338	0	a	But that that covers all the all the other settings .
88339	0	a	It covers everything then .
88340	0	a	Yeah , you can put that on the two eight four and six or whatever .
88341	0	a	No , you can use the
88342	0	a	And you al can also use the normal skip buttons for that .
88343	0	a	Th in that way we have like only the numbers , the power button , skip and volume , and then ten rem
88344	0	a	yeah , mute .
88345	0	a	, yeah .
88346	0	a	A mute and a teletext and a menu .
88347	0	a	A teletext and a menu , and then then i that is it .
88348	0	a	That is all .
88349	0	a	It is all we need .
88350	0	a	Yeah .
88351	0	a	Okay , another stuf some stuff about the the the design of the docking station .
88352	0	a	Great .
88353	0	a	Yeah .
88354	0	a	Okay , that is not mu not much functions .
88355	0	a	So
88356	0	a	Okay .
88357	0	a	Something important about a s , no , which sh
88358	0	a	should remind us of the remote itself , I guess .
88359	0	a	Yeah , definitely .
88360	1	a	, in one colour .
88361	1	a	Are we going to do something with the spongy thing there ?
88362	0	a	Yeah , that is true , that is true .
88363	0	a	Just use
88364	0	a	I think the spongy thing already comes forward in the in the in the cushions , pads and things on the s side .
88365	0	a	What are we going to do now ?
88366	1	a	I will make one in the next twenty minutes .
88367	1	a	And we will make it spongy and and and well , the fruity thing is just the shape should be fru i did
88368	0	a	I think this is kind of fruity , you know .
88369	0	a	Just round shapes with
88370	1	a	Yeah , but we are going to have to we really have to think I think colours is very important , because it has to be flashy , but and but it d it does not have to be annoying ,
88371	0	a	that when you , know ,
88372	0	a	some things is just over the top , and when you have it on your table for more than two weeks , you it just gets annoying , because it is so big and flashy .
88373	0	a	Yeah , it is kind of fruity , and with th with catchy colours w
88374	0	a	Yeah , definitely .
88375	1	a	, it has to be some level of subtlety , but we have to still have to think of how we manage to to get to that .
88376	0	a	Yeah .
88377	0	a	Okay .
88378	0	a	Okay .
88379	0	a	Guess we are through then .
88380	0	a	I guess so .
88381	0	a	But we I think also we just
88382	1	a	so we have to do something with colour but also , I I think we have to keep the dark colour thing in mind .
88383	0	a	I think that is adds to the
88384	0	a	too much colour maybe m
88385	1	a	But our des design experts will work that out .
88386	0	a	Yes .
88387	0	a	Yeah .
88388	0	a	Too much colour , i it when you got it in a living room
88389	0	a	, it is too much maybe
88390	0	a	Yea
88391	0	a	yeah .
88392	0	a	It has to be
88393	0	a	Yeah .
88394	0	a	Okay , well I think the meeting will be over within a minute .
88395	0	a	Yep .
88396	1	a	So we will wrap up .
88397	0	a	Something like that .
88398	1	a	Or is there anything we would like to discuss ?
88399	0	a	That is right .
88400	0	a	I guess not .
88401	0	a	Okay .
88402	1	a	Do you , guys ?
88403	0	a	No ?
88404	0	a	In the shared folder .
88405	0	a	No .
88406	0	a	Okay .
88407	0	a	Well , you will read the minutes in the
88408	0	a	you can find them in the
88409	0	a	pro probably .
88410	0	a	Oh , okay ,
88411	0	a	yeah .
88412	0	a	Yeah no , for su for sure
88413	1	a	because I am will now type them out .
88414	0	a	, y
88415	0	a	yeah .
88416	0	a	You will see in you email , I guess .
88417	0	a	Yeah .
88418	0	a	I think
88419	0	a	But toilet paper roll and
88420	0	a	Okay .
88421	0	a	Yeah , I do not know .
88422	0	a	I do not know .
88423	0	a	I hope so .
88424	0	a	And the other thing is that you do not have kind of prototype or something like that .
88425	0	a	You see a kind of prototype you can a little bit more
88426	0	a	Yeah .
88427	0	a	Construct one , yeah .
88428	0	a	With you laptop ?
88429	0	a	Yeah .
88430	0	a	Oh my God .
88431	1	a	Alright , shall we get back to work ?
88432	0	a	Great .
88433	0	a	Yep .
88434	0	a	I was waiting for the l last message , but
88435	0	a	Well you are .
88436	0	a	Yeah .
88437	0	a	Bastard .
88438	0	a	 
88439	0	a	Okay , welcome to the detailed design meeting .
88440	1	a	Again , I am going to take minutes .
88441	0	a	Oh , we are going to have a prototype presentation first .
88442	0	a	, who is going to give the prototype presentation ?
88443	0	a	You two guys ?
88444	1	a	Okay .
88445	0	a	Yes .
88446	1	a	Go ahead .
88447	0	a	coffee .
88448	0	a	Kay , we have made a prototype .
88449	0	a	we have got our aspects from the last meeting .
88450	0	a	especially we looked at the form , material and the colour .
88451	0	a	we have drawn here the p prototype .
88452	0	a	The logo is is is pretty obvious to see on the on the remote control , but it is necessary when you want to build your company f to a level higher .
88453	0	a	our interface elements , there are shown in the in the drawing .
88454	1	a	Maybe you can point them The functions .
88455	0	a	, well the all the functions are discussed
88456	0	a	I think the most of the functions are obvious .
88457	0	a	, it is a little bit .
88458	0	a	, power button .
88459	0	a	then the the the nine channels .
88460	0	a	the volume at the side , and the other side is the programmes .
88461	0	a	And then we had just two buttons , we place them in the middle , the menu , and for the teletext
88462	0	a	I thought that was th
88463	0	a	Oh , the mute button .
88464	0	a	Oh no , the the the mute button misses now .
88465	0	a	Alright , I
88466	0	a	Yeah .
88467	0	a	Do y do you
88468	0	a	did we want to have a m mute button ?
88469	0	a	Huh .
88470	0	a	But that
88471	0	a	It is here then , in the middle .
88472	0	a	Yeah .
88473	1	a	Alright , and you gotta point out which is the volume button and which is the programme button .
88474	0	a	Yes ,
88475	0	a	we have disc
88476	0	a	Most of the users
88477	0	a	Yes , y there there will be a p a little a little P on that and a little
88478	0	a	yeah .
88479	0	a	Well , yeah mo mo
88480	0	a	Yeah , well most of them are right handed .
88481	1	a	Yeah ,
88482	1	a	but you you gotta make it clear on the on
88483	1	a	Yeah , and a and a triangle on that .
88484	0	a	Yeah well , I do not have time in anymore on the
88485	0	a	Oh yeah , just progr programme above , I think .
88486	0	a	Yes .
88487	1	a	Next to that I kind of miss a zero actually .
88488	1	a	Wait , there is was one thing I wanted to ask .
88489	0	a	, there are different ways for remote controls to do like d
88490	0	a	I call it teens and twenties .
88491	0	a	, y th th th the two numbers .
88492	0	a	Yes .
88493	0	a	All n no , that is kind of dependent on the television .
88494	0	a	Yeah , true , yeah .
88495	0	a	It is a television .
88496	0	a	Yes .
88497	0	a	Yeah ,
88498	0	a	but do we have do we need extra buttons ,
88499	0	a	for example some some have to
88500	0	a	Yeah , but you do not you do not actually need them ,
88501	0	a	becau b l
88502	0	a	a lot of remote controls work that y when y that you when you fir you push the one first , then you have a couple of seconds
88503	0	a	No , I do not think so .
88504	0	a	I think so .
88505	0	a	I think
88506	0	a	Yeah ,
88507	1	a	I think you should add A cross , or whatever .
88508	0	a	Yes , yes , you have you have a lot of standard buttons that has to be on it , th with the one and a double
88509	0	a	yes .
88510	1	a	Zero ?
88511	1	a	May maybe here ?
88512	0	a	Yeah .
88513	1	a	Yeah , line .
88514	0	a	And then a second .
88515	0	a	No , that is dependent on the television .
88516	0	a	Yes , you have televisions , then you have to , you know , you have to press
88517	0	a	Yes , but but a lot
88518	0	a	Yes ,
88519	0	a	but
88520	0	a	some televisions do not accept that that No , no ,
88521	0	a	but s
88522	0	a	Yes , but some some old televisions you have to click on a special button , then you go to a a next level , you can push two buttons .
88523	0	a	I do know so .
88524	0	a	Is it depending on television ?
88525	0	a	Yeah .
88526	0	a	Nah , I do not think so really ,
88527	0	a	because you have a
88528	0	a	I know some remote controls that do not have these buttons , but you still can , know , obviously you can still select the twenty a number in the twenty or in the ten .
88529	0	a	Yeah .
88530	0	a	Yes , but no remote control nowadays are they come with the television .
88531	0	a	Or actually , the other way around .
88532	0	a	But
88533	0	a	Yeah .
88534	0	a	No , I think I really think it is n
88535	0	a	because you can
88536	0	a	when when you put a button on it with like one and then a dash , it is the same thing as when you just push the one , because it i it first gives you the functionality of that that separate button you also had to apply .
88537	0	a	Yeah , well but su
88538	0	a	If
88539	0	a	No no no .
88540	0	a	Yeah , because that is i it is for television .
88541	0	a	It is exact the same thing .
88542	0	a	So some television respond differently .
88543	0	a	Look , if i i
88544	0	a	Yes .
88545	0	a	No ,
88546	0	a	listen listen .
88547	0	a	When you push the button , the remote control gives a signal .
88548	0	a	I in th in the first place it gives a signal which it would also send when you put a separate button on it .
88549	0	a	Yes , that is true .
88550	0	a	The one with dash ,
88551	0	a	that signal gi
88552	0	a	and when y whe when you do not push another button on the remote control within five seconds , then the remote control gives a signal for channel one .
88553	0	a	True .
88554	0	a	No No ,
88555	0	a	it it
88556	0	a	it works if you have not got a special button for it , if you push a one , then on your television there will appear a one and a a line , which is an empty space .
88557	0	a	I think it works that way , really .
88558	0	a	Yeah , but it is exact the same that w would appear when you put a separate button push a separate button .
88559	0	a	Yeah ,
88560	0	a	but you do not underst
88561	0	a	you do not understand my point .
88562	0	a	Yep .
88563	0	a	True .
88564	0	a	I think it is exact the same thing
88565	0	a	when y
88566	0	a	No , but then they would a would also support that button , because it is the same thing .
88567	0	a	You want
88568	0	a	Yes , but some television do not support it .
88569	0	a	But the ex
88570	0	a	Yeah .
88571	0	a	Listen ,
88572	0	a	with that that is
88573	0	a	that special but button you are talking about , eh ?
88574	0	a	That is just a signal to recei ju they send a t signal to the v tv TV that they have to put a one in on your screen and a dash , which you can pu
88575	0	a	so you can still put another number on it .
88576	0	a	When you do not have that separate button , and you push y one , it is exactly the same thing .
88577	0	a	Do y you
88578	0	a	the remote control gives that same signal as it would give when you only had
88579	0	a	Yeah .
88580	0	a	No , s some some televisions need the input first and and you c
88581	0	a	No , that is not true .
88582	0	a	No ,
88583	0	a	a remote can
88584	0	a	Yes ,
88585	0	a	so they need no , they need
88586	0	a	No ,
88587	0	a	but Yeah , it
88588	0	a	And the button for the SCART audio video external input .
88589	0	a	But you give the input .
88590	0	a	You push the one .
88591	0	a	That is the same thing as the button with the one and it
88592	0	a	yes it it is .
88593	0	a	It is simply not true .
88594	0	a	Think about it .
88595	0	a	It is simply not true .
88596	0	a	You you can wai when you push the one you can show on the telly a one and just a dash , and then wait two seconds or something
88597	1	a	We will discuss them in the usability lab .
88598	0	a	No , remote control does not give signal after five seconds .
88599	0	a	And it is the same thing what happens
88600	0	a	and a g remote control gives another signal after five seconds that is just one .
88601	0	a	Remote control is a stupid thing .
88602	0	a	If you push a button , it sends it immediately to to the television .
88603	0	a	Yeah , that is true .
88604	0	a	Yeah ,
88605	0	a	but I m
88606	0	a	but it is
88607	0	a	I I know for sure that some televisions that w th th the remote control supplied , only ha has the c these buttons with a one and a dash and a two and a dash , but when you use a bu a n remote control that does not sport these buttons , it still works .
88608	0	a	But okay , we we will impl
88609	0	a	No ,
88610	1	a	we will apply them then for now .
88611	0	a	No , definitely not .
88612	0	a	Definitely not .
88613	0	a	eva evaluation .
88614	0	a	I do not know I do not know if if it is it is necessary .
88615	1	a	Yeah , app just apply them next to the zero , the one and the two .
88616	0	a	Yeah ?
88617	0	a	Okay .
88618	0	a	Yeah , I think so .
88619	0	a	Yeah , for now , if we do not know for sure whether
88620	0	a	Yeah
88621	0	a	but
88622	0	a	okay .
88623	0	a	Yes .
88624	0	a	Ach .
88625	0	a	, you can access that via zero , and then minus , I guess .
88626	0	a	What I said about the remote control sending another signal , that that might not be true , but I still think i it it all TVs in some ways support it
88627	0	a	, I do not know .
88628	0	a	Yeah .
88629	0	a	Yeah .
88630	0	a	No , no .
88631	0	a	I think it is more c is m
88632	0	a	maybe we do not we both do not really understand how it i how it really works , but I think there is more to in than wha than what you just said .
88633	0	a	, remote control sends one signal at one button press .
88634	0	a	I do think that m TVs support mur multiple kind of remote controls .
88635	0	a	, some
88636	0	a	N some televisions when when you want to go further than ten
88637	0	a	No , you have to you have to give the television two or more signals .
88638	0	a	M
88639	0	a	Th wo not work wi with
88640	0	a	to have that special button .
88641	0	a	When you press one button , you give one signal .
88642	0	a	And the older televisions need more signals to go a level higher .
88643	0	a	But
88644	0	a	When you make the technology that that it will give more signals , it could work , but Just a basic idea of of of the most most y most common and simple operations on the remote .
88645	0	a	Yep .
88646	0	a	Okay , well we will see .
88647	0	a	Okay .
88648	0	a	I kind of miss the docking station .
88649	0	a	Yeah .
88650	0	a	Yes .
88651	0	a	It is here on the
88652	0	a	We came
88653	0	a	Yes .
88654	0	a	Well it
88655	0	a	yeah , there is nothing
88656	0	a	I think it is pretty basic ,
88657	0	a	the the there is no fu
88658	0	a	there is one there is one button ,
88659	0	a	that is wha there is there is
88660	0	a	there is one function and that is n the one button when you want to find it .
88661	0	a	No nothing really trendy about it .
88662	1	a	But maybe we can maybe we can make the docking station a bit standard for for the other products we sell ,
88663	0	a	because Real Real Reaction sells more products than only remote controls .
88664	0	a	The button .
88665	0	a	Yep .
88666	1	a	So maybe we can use the docking station , for example , MP three players or or hearing devices .
88667	0	a	I think that is very difficult , because of different shapes of devices .
88668	0	a	Yes , but when you put that same volt voltages on it , you can put
88669	0	a	when the when the when o the the the lowest part of it , when it is o the same as the other products , you can put it all on the same
88670	0	a	Yes ,
88671	0	a	but we can make
88672	1	a	No , we can make make the most lowest part all the same .
88673	0	a	Yeah , of course .
88674	0	a	Well it it got it it has got to fit into the shape , of course .
88675	0	a	The technology and the voltage can be the same .
88676	0	a	That is that is true .
88677	0	a	But i if you all make the m having a bottom like this , then they all fit .
88678	0	a	Yeah , that is true ,
88679	0	a	but
88680	0	a	Yes ,
88681	0	a	but I I
88682	0	a	g
88683	0	a	Should not it fall then ?
88684	0	a	It is not going to fall down ?
88685	0	a	That is a bit
88686	0	a	yeah , I think
88687	0	a	No , but if if
88688	1	a	like this , I will I will point it out ,
88689	0	a	if you got a a a base a base like this ,
88690	1	a	I wo not draw it really .
88691	1	a	When when the the recharger has a has a bit what points out , we can place all on top of it .
88692	1	a	Just have to be big enough for the biggest
88693	0	a	No , when you make it large enough no it it will not .
88694	0	a	But then it is a little bit
88695	0	a	But it is just an idea .
88696	0	a	If you got a base which is as big as this
88697	0	a	Yeah sure , but if you got if you got a tiny player , it can
88698	0	a	Yeah .
88699	0	a	But it is flat it is flat as as this ,
88700	1	a	so we can p make all the products as flat as this .
88701	0	a	You can .
88702	0	a	But i i i
88703	0	a	it is backwards .
88704	0	a	Yes , but when you make a bit of big
88705	0	a	Yes , little holer littler , little products go deeper in it .
88706	0	a	But it is it is backwards .
88707	0	a	It is leaning .
88708	0	a	It is leaning backwards , I think , in the in the docking station .
88709	1	a	, wha what you could do if you from the bottom
88710	0	a	oh , right , help .
88711	0	a	That is text .
88712	0	a	But
88713	1	a	Well let is ha let is talk about the docking station later ,
88714	0	a	because maybe we have we have to consider the docking station anyway , because we have some cost issues still to come .
88715	1	a	, you could make like a hole in it , you know , of in in the
88716	0	a	Yeah .
88717	0	a	That i that is possible , yep .
88718	0	a	Yeah , sure , you are right .
88719	0	a	Yes .
88720	0	a	And
88721	0	a	the f the look and feel would be great on this remote control ,
88722	0	a	because you always will pick up the remote control in the in the smallest area .
88723	0	a	Oh .
88724	0	a	But we have to look
88725	0	a	n I do not know .
88726	0	a	I do not like the colours .
88727	0	a	Yeah .
88728	0	a	Then your left thumb of your right thumb is near the programme button , which is the most common used function , and all the other buttons are available for your thumb .
88729	0	a	So it is it is it is really good design .
88730	0	a	Okay .
88731	0	a	Yeah .
88732	0	a	Yes .
88733	0	a	Alright .
88734	0	a	That is it ?
88735	0	a	I think added lights are going to be a problem too .
88736	0	a	Yes , on the side there will be a strip of rubber , and in the middle there is a hard a hard material , a bit hard plastic with a light behind it .
88737	0	a	The light .
88738	0	a	Okay .
88739	1	a	And other lights ?
88740	0	a	No , o on the on the front .
88741	1	a	Yes , we can make also n neon lights on it , or or the buttons that can make light on it .
88742	0	a	Yeah , okay .
88743	1	a	Maybe the the logo .
88744	0	a	Yes .
88745	0	a	lights ?
88746	0	a	But , it will also use batteries ,
88747	0	a	and do we want to
88748	0	a	The all the aspects of the interface buttons were Yes .
88749	0	a	Yeah , why not ?
88750	0	a	Of course .
88751	0	a	Okay .
88752	0	a	For now , this is is good enough .
88753	0	a	Okay .
88754	0	a	Yeah , what was on the
88755	0	a	Okay ,
88756	0	a	but in the
88757	0	a	oh yeah , the colour ,
88758	0	a	because we are going to use one colour for the the plastic enclosure and one colour for the rubber ,
88759	0	a	is not it ?
88760	0	a	Then we are going to do the buttons in the i are we are going to have rubber buttons .
88761	0	a	And they are be a they will be in the same colour as the rubber on the side .
88762	0	a	Yes .
88763	0	a	Yeah .
88764	0	a	, in the same colour as the side .
88765	0	a	Yeah .
88766	0	a	Yeah , I think I think that will be good .
88767	0	a	Okay .
88768	0	a	Yeah .
88769	1	a	And I think we should use a a darker colour for the plastic , and maybe some more m brighter and flashy stuff
88770	1	a	Yeah , we will talk about the lights later .
88771	0	a	Yeah .
88772	1	a	Yes , maybe we can use on the on the lights on the side we can use multiple lights ,
88773	0	a	so it will
88774	0	a	Yes .
88775	0	a	Yes .
88776	0	a	Cause I also don
88777	0	a	yeah ,
88778	0	a	it is depends on the costs and such .
88779	0	a	Yep .
88780	0	a	Yeah .
88781	1	a	But , and we have to agree upon the exact colours , but may I dunno if that is important , but we will talk about that later .
88782	0	a	Okay , for now this is this is okay .
88783	0	a	We will .
88784	0	a	, the next p y
88785	0	a	you going to give a presentation too ?
88786	1	a	, I have to see the agenda .
88787	1	a	Well , yeah , I I am going to do something right there , yeah .
88788	0	a	No .
88789	0	a	Detail design .
88790	1	a	We gotta do that on the right the most right most screen ,
88791	0	a	because the leftmost
88792	0	a	Yep , that is me .
88793	0	a	Evaluation criteria .
88794	0	a	Okay .
88795	0	a	Okay .
88796	0	a	Alright .
88797	0	a	I will be needing that image ,
88798	1	a	so leave it please .
88799	0	a	Go away .
88800	1	a	Right , we are going to evaluate that design according to a few points .
88801	1	a	, we g the four of us are going to do that together .
88802	0	a	I want to have a colour over here , come on .
88803	0	a	Right , the remote is not ugly ,
88804	0	a	a bit weird sentence ,
88805	0	a	but the positive things has to be on the left ,
88806	0	a	so I said not ugly instead of ugly .
88807	0	a	, what would you say ,
88808	0	a	we we gotta give points to to all of these to evaluate that design ,
88809	0	a	and please forget the drawing skills of these guys .
88810	0	a	Okay .
88811	0	a	The remote control is not ugly .
88812	0	a	How do you feel ?
88813	0	a	Yes .
88814	0	a	Yeah , I think four maybe would be appropriate ,
88815	0	a	because it is
88816	0	a	Yeah , maybe it really depends on taste .
88817	0	a	, I mean it is kind of , our design .
88818	0	a	It is
88819	0	a	so if maybe a lot of people find it really ugly , you know , o other people find it really cool .
88820	0	a	Yeah .
88821	0	a	Background colour .
88822	0	a	I do not know or I do not know
88823	0	a	how you
88824	0	a	Casting .
88825	0	a	How do you guys feel ?
88826	0	a	The different designs .
88827	0	a	I think I think the the fronts will give it a more less uglier side , because you can make it in your own
88828	0	a	yes , you can make it in your own more to your own personality or or house style .
88829	0	a	Yeah .
88830	0	a	Yes .
88831	0	a	Yeah .
88832	0	a	Okay .
88833	0	a	Yeah ,
88834	0	a	but we d we did not we are we are not planning to use fronts , I believe .
88835	0	a	No , not not fronts , but different designs .
88836	0	a	With a colour a co a colours .
88837	0	a	No , not fronts .
88838	0	a	Different designs .
88839	0	a	Yes .
88840	0	a	Oh , okay .
88841	0	a	And that is still , yeah , is is is a little personal touch , I guess .
88842	0	a	Different colours maybe , yeah .
88843	0	a	Okay , but
88844	1	a	Oh , maybe we should do three or something that w you know , our
88845	0	a	Yeah .
88846	0	a	What ?
88847	0	a	Yeah , wha wha what would you guys think ?
88848	0	a	Personally .
88849	0	a	Or forty .
88850	0	a	Personally .
88851	0	a	We can make it a one .
88852	0	a	Yes ,
88853	0	a	but what is it ?
88854	0	a	Guido ?
88855	0	a	Two or three .
88856	0	a	I think two or three .
88857	0	a	yeah .
88858	0	a	I agree .
88859	0	a	, I I go for the positive .
88860	0	a	I was
88861	0	a	I was thinking about three , so I guess three is a bit
88862	0	a	oh , what am I doing ?
88863	1	a	I will mark it .
88864	0	a	So I go for two .
88865	0	a	, I was thinking about four , so I think three is
88866	0	a	Yeah
88867	0	a	well , let that let is make that a one .
88868	0	a	Okay , three .
88869	0	a	The remote control is that n makes zapping easy .
88870	0	a	Yeah .
88871	0	a	Yes .
88872	0	a	Two .
88873	0	a	Yeah ?
88874	0	a	Antek , you agree ?
88875	0	a	Yeah .
88876	0	a	One .
88877	0	a	One .
88878	0	a	Yes .
88879	0	a	Okay
88880	0	a	yeah , I will I will agree .
88881	0	a	Yes .
88882	0	a	That is one thing for sure .
88883	0	a	You are not Antek .
88884	0	a	I am the I am the usability , so Yeah .
88885	0	a	I totally agree .
88886	0	a	The remote control the remote control is relevant buttons are prominently visible .
88887	0	a	Yes .
88888	0	a	Yeah , two or a one , I guess .
88889	0	a	The
88890	0	a	Well
88891	0	a	Yeah , well menu
88892	0	a	Yeah , maybe .
88893	0	a	It is something we really put work into .
88894	0	a	Yeah , I yeah .
88895	0	a	I would say a one because every button is relevant .
88896	0	a	It is all about the buttons .
88897	0	a	And our
88898	0	a	oh yeah , it is a b
88899	0	a	yeah .
88900	0	a	Yeah ?
88901	0	a	Alright .
88902	0	a	That is a one ?
88903	0	a	You agree ?
88904	0	a	The remote control has not got too much redundant or unneeded buttons .
88905	0	a	Yeah .
88906	0	a	I think we totally succeeded there .
88907	0	a	But
88908	0	a	Well maybe a two , because of the menu button or something .
88909	0	a	Oh
88910	0	a	Yeah , that is true .
88911	0	a	And telete
88912	0	a	Yeah , we do not know if the they are necessary .
88913	0	a	That is true .
88914	0	a	Also , the the the buttons of the one , the two , the the digits ,
88915	0	a	o they are used Can
88916	0	a	yes , three , two .
88917	0	a	the the
88918	0	a	yeah ,
88919	0	a	m well , you d you have got a point .
88920	0	a	I think a two .
88921	0	a	Yeah , true .
88922	0	a	Yeah , I agree .
88923	0	a	Came a long way , but not we did not not
88924	0	a	No ,
88925	0	a	w w
88926	0	a	it can also always be more simplistic , but two is
88927	0	a	yeah .
88928	0	a	Two or three ?
88929	0	a	Two ?
88930	0	a	Antek .
88931	0	a	two .
88932	0	a	But you ca not make a remote control without them ,
88933	0	a	because
88934	0	a	Yes .
88935	0	a	Because we got
88936	0	a	Well .
88937	0	a	Nay that that that is true , that is true .
88938	0	a	They are definitely needed .
88939	0	a	So
88940	1	a	we put it on a two ?
88941	0	a	The remote control has got a really trendy look .
88942	0	a	Yes .
88943	0	a	A one .
88944	0	a	Maarten .
88945	0	a	Yeah , a t I think a two .
88946	0	a	Yeah
88947	0	a	yeah ,
88948	0	a	y
88949	0	a	i
88950	0	a	it is hard to say from this picture .
88951	0	a	Yeah .
88952	0	a	We
88953	0	a	we have tried to make it the the best trendy look ever .
88954	0	a	Yeah .
88955	0	a	Ever , yeah .
88956	0	a	Guido .
88957	0	a	But I do think it is more
88958	0	a	But I do think that it is more trendy than beautiful .
88959	0	a	, I will I will make it a three ,
88960	0	a	because yeah .
88961	0	a	I I th
88962	0	a	Yeah .
88963	0	a	Yeah , I agree .
88964	0	a	Yes .
88965	0	a	I agree .
88966	0	a	So so I think maybe it has to score higher on this than on the
88967	0	a	A th a three .
88968	0	a	True , yeah .
88969	0	a	I was planning to give it a two , where I give the not ugly
88970	0	a	oh , yeah , that is true .
88971	0	a	You agree on the two ?
88972	0	a	Great .
88973	0	a	Yeah .
88974	0	a	Yes .
88975	0	a	I i when you compare to the
88976	0	a	what is the difference with
88977	0	a	Okay .
88978	0	a	Remote control has not got too much redundant or unneeded buttons .
88979	0	a	, I copied that one .
88980	1	a	Well , forget that .
88981	0	a	Go away .
88982	0	a	Remote control has got innovative technology implanted .
88983	0	a	No .
88984	0	a	No .
88985	0	a	No .
88986	0	a	We are not well , maybe the the the on the side .
88987	0	a	No , not LCD , so .
88988	0	a	Yeah ,
88989	0	a	but we
88990	0	a	you mean the rubber stuff ?
88991	1	a	Yeah ,
88992	1	a	but we have t
88993	1	a	we have to talk about the lights .
88994	0	a	Yeah , and the light .
88995	0	a	And the light maybe .
88996	0	a	But that that is not innovative .
88997	0	a	But
88998	0	a	Well , six .
88999	0	a	And I do not u also
89000	0	a	it is also really not innovative ,
89001	0	a	it is more
89002	0	a	No , six .
89003	0	a	Well , I g
89004	0	a	It is not
89005	1	a	seven ?
89006	0	a	Why why not a seven ?
89007	0	a	How ?
89008	0	a	Yeah , you think the lights are innovative ?
89009	0	a	Well , it is n true .
89010	0	a	Lights lights are
89011	0	a	Six .
89012	0	a	Or seven maybe , yeah .
89013	0	a	No , six .
89014	0	a	Or six .
89015	0	a	Six .
89016	0	a	Yeah , mine is seven .
89017	0	a	Because we have tried to make it a little bit innovative ,
89018	0	a	but it but it
89019	0	a	With the lights it it is it is kind of future
89020	0	a	But still you can retrieve it when it is when it is gone , with the with
89021	0	a	Yes .
89022	0	a	Yeah .
89023	0	a	it is depends on the on the maybe
89024	0	a	No , I think I think actually it is a seven maybe , but there is nothing innovative about it .
89025	0	a	, I agree ,
89026	0	a	m
89027	0	a	but I will
89028	0	a	Yeah , you you did not draw the docking station .
89029	0	a	Innovative in generally or just f original for
89030	0	a	A docking station is innova
89031	0	a	Okay .
89032	0	a	N no no ,
89033	0	a	t .
89034	0	a	Yeah , it it is
89035	0	a	I think I think with its
89036	0	a	I think more m that that is
89037	0	a	n
89038	0	a	No , well , the agenda says evaluate now ,
89039	0	a	so I think we It is it is a six .
89040	0	a	The docking station is a is a little bit innovative .
89041	0	a	Yeah , I mean the dock station , but
89042	0	a	but ,
89043	0	a	I think the the docking station , it is going to be a kind of a problem .
89044	0	a	It is a part of the remote .
89045	0	a	And with the speaker on the there is also a speaker .
89046	0	a	But
89047	1	a	Well , let is leave it open for for us later to see what , because we have to reevaluate anyway .
89048	0	a	Well I i
89049	0	a	yeah .
89050	0	a	Okay .
89051	0	a	No ?
89052	0	a	Okay , for now it is a six or a seven , sev six maybe ,
89053	0	a	because
89054	0	a	Yeah , but I do not I do not know if it is very inno
89055	0	a	yeah .
89056	0	a	Six .
89057	0	a	But the retrieval or the
89058	0	a	Yes ,
89059	0	a	how would you innovate a remote control more ?
89060	0	a	To put it on your head .
89061	0	a	That m f
89062	0	a	Yeah , for the retrieval function .
89063	0	a	Yeah .
89064	0	a	I think that is very innovative for a remote control .
89065	0	a	Yeah , v
89066	0	a	Yeah , more through like function TV functionalities and
89067	0	a	no no ,
89068	0	a	you know what I mean .
89069	0	a	You have
89070	0	a	must be innovative technology for remote controls , but more in how you control stuff , not in how you find your
89071	0	a	yeah .
89072	0	a	Yeah sure ,
89073	0	a	but
89074	0	a	But I d I definitely do not think it is a five ,
89075	0	a	but
89076	0	a	Remote control is easy to use .
89077	0	a	Yeah , it is that is that is
89078	1	a	think about it la later on
89079	0	a	and
89080	0	a	Yeah , as a a one or a two ma at least .
89081	0	a	Yes .
89082	0	a	Yeah , a two .
89083	0	a	Yes .
89084	0	a	I think a two .
89085	0	a	Yeah ?
89086	0	a	Come on .
89087	0	a	Yeah , it is good .
89088	0	a	More two .
89089	0	a	The remote control has not got .
89090	0	a	No , I would have seen that one before .
89091	0	a	Oh , you skipped one , here .
89092	0	a	I have just filled
89093	0	a	Go away .
89094	0	a	You like the buttons .
89095	0	a	I found twelve questions so much , but it still is ten .
89096	0	a	Remote control will be bought by
89097	0	a	Yeah .
89098	0	a	It will be bought by people under the age of forty .
89099	0	a	Yes .
89100	0	a	Yes .
89101	0	a	Definitely .
89102	0	a	In in
89103	0	a	and comparing with people of th of the age above ?
89104	0	a	We do not know .
89105	0	a	Well
89106	0	a	, just in general .
89107	0	a	No no no .
89108	0	a	No , just if they if they buy it .
89109	0	a	Yeah , a two .
89110	0	a	Yeah ,
89111	0	a	but I think I think two .
89112	0	a	But
89113	0	a	Yes , two , but only in c when you compare it with with elderly .
89114	0	a	Yeah , what do you think ?
89115	0	a	Antek ?
89116	0	a	No , that is no comparison .
89117	0	a	Yeah , I think two , yeah .
89118	0	a	I agree .
89119	0	a	Two .
89120	0	a	, that is not the question .
89121	0	a	It is just w it will be bought by people under forty .
89122	0	a	Yeah , you can
89123	0	a	yeah , you can be very picky about it .
89124	0	a	And I do not mean two people .
89125	0	a	This is just guessing .
89126	0	a	yeah ,
89127	0	a	just make it we will make it a two .
89128	0	a	Make it a two .
89129	0	a	W w
89130	0	a	Right , the rem
89131	0	a	The remote control has recognisable corporate image , colour , logo or slogan .
89132	0	a	When it succeeds , it can get a two ,
89133	0	a	mu
89134	0	a	A logo .
89135	0	a	Oh no .
89136	0	a	Yeah .
89137	0	a	Yeah , you have make an
89138	0	a	slogan is quite obvious .
89139	0	a	We do not have the slogan though .
89140	0	a	Oh , the slogan .
89141	0	a	Oh the oh sorry , no , not not the slogan .
89142	0	a	Can we see the slogan ?
89143	0	a	Are we going to do that ?
89144	0	a	Three ?
89145	0	a	I agree .
89146	0	a	The logo .
89147	1	a	Yeah , you can put that on the side if if we would like to .
89148	1	a	Underneath it or something .
89149	0	a	Yes , encrypted with
89150	0	a	Yes .
89151	0	a	Yeah , and I will I th still think it is going to be a two or a three .
89152	0	a	A three .
89153	0	a	Maybe a three this time .
89154	0	a	Three .
89155	0	a	Yeah , a three .
89156	0	a	Because of the slogan
89157	0	a	Remote control is got a basic design intended for novice users .
89158	0	a	And
89159	0	a	, it is a one or a two .
89160	0	a	Yeah , two .
89161	0	a	Yes .
89162	0	a	Two ?
89163	0	a	Two .
89164	0	a	Yeah , make it a two .
89165	0	a	Two .
89166	0	a	Alright .
89167	1	a	We gotta add up the scores now to see our total average .
89168	0	a	Four , five , seven , nine .
89169	0	a	Forget that .
89170	0	a	Fifteen , seventeen , twenty one , twenty four , twenty six .
89171	0	a	Twenty six .
89172	0	a	It is a two point six .
89173	0	a	It is not that bad .
89174	0	a	Alright , we
89175	0	a	yeah .
89176	0	a	Yeah , and that is mostly the inno
89177	0	a	when we score higher on innovative technology , we would score two , which is quite a great score .
89178	0	a	Yeah .
89179	0	a	True .
89180	0	a	Okay .
89181	0	a	, this is was the evaluation ?
89182	0	a	Because I I still think that the most important part of this meeting still has
89183	0	a	Yeah .
89184	0	a	This was my evaluation .
89185	0	a	So
89186	0	a	We did a pretty nice job until now .
89187	0	a	, is this your
89188	0	a	Whatever .
89189	0	a	Is there something after this meeting ?
89190	0	a	Or
89191	0	a	Okay .
89192	0	a	Well , I think we gotta fill out another questionnaire .
89193	0	a	No .
89194	0	a	Okay , yeah .
89195	0	a	Still opened or
89196	0	a	Yeah .
89197	0	a	Yeah .
89198	0	a	Okay , finance .
89199	0	a	Because I received a spreadsheet .
89200	0	a	Shoot .
89201	0	a	A five .
89202	0	a	A five .
89203	0	a	Yeah ,
89204	0	a	but I actually do not need this presentation , I guess .
89205	0	a	Oh .
89206	0	a	Does not matter .
89207	1	a	I am going to open the spreadsheet and we are going to work this out together ,
89208	0	a	because I did not really fin I have a .
89209	0	a	Did not really finish it .
89210	0	a	Well , we We will see .
89211	0	a	We will stumble upon some problems .
89212	0	a	We probably will .
89213	0	a	I probably have already opened it here .
89214	0	a	try it again .
89215	0	a	First of all , the all the docking station and costs and such are not included in this list .
89216	0	a	But let is let is st start with beginning .
89217	0	a	We include one battery .
89218	1	a	I i
89219	1	a	I will explain
89220	0	a	its , the
89221	0	a	the components are listed over here .
89222	0	a	, price is given .
89223	0	a	We yeah ,
89224	0	a	we we indicate the amount of components of the specif specific component , how much we need of them .
89225	0	a	The amount , yeah .
89226	1	a	And then , we will calcula Do not watch the number yet .
89227	0	a	I do not know if it is filled in properly .
89228	0	a	Okay , we need one battery .
89229	0	a	One battery .
89230	0	a	I think one battery is enough .
89231	0	a	Yes .
89232	0	a	We do not need kinetic , solar cells , hand dynamo .
89233	0	a	A s okay ,
89234	0	a	this this is a p first problem .
89235	0	a	, I think
89236	0	a	we should know how many simple chips , regular chips
89237	0	a	Okay .
89238	0	a	it is it is one one chip , but but you have to choose one from it .
89239	0	a	But
89240	0	a	Where did we find this information ?
89241	0	a	Was it
89242	0	a	I think it was your job in the first meet ,
89243	0	a	f your first presentation to make this clear ,
89244	0	a	but then you had some t time problems .
89245	0	a	The simple chip is e enough I I think , but with the lights with the lights and the retrieval , it can be No ,
89246	0	a	I
89247	0	a	Yes ,
89248	0	a	my my my
89249	0	a	The the email I got said simple chip , but when we put in the speaker and the retriever device , it will cost a a bit more , like I think the advanced chip maybe .
89250	0	a	I do not know
89251	0	a	I have not got an idea on on which we need to use , really .
89252	0	a	No .
89253	0	a	Yeah .
89254	1	a	Maybe you can look it up right now .
89255	0	a	Yeah .
89256	0	a	And how do you know ?
89257	0	a	I mean , you got that email .
89258	0	a	Bec No , the they did not know about a retriever or a speaker in it .
89259	0	a	Did it point out what to use them for ?
89260	0	a	Alright ,
89261	1	a	well , point out the advanced chip for now , I guess .
89262	0	a	Okay ,
89263	0	a	but okay .
89264	0	a	When we do not when we leave the retriever and such aside , what
89265	0	a	then it would be a simple chip .
89266	0	a	Then it is a simple chip .
89267	0	a	And with the retriever , it would be an advanced chip .
89268	0	a	Yes ,
89269	0	a	I
89270	0	a	I
89271	0	a	I s
89272	0	a	I
89273	0	a	That will be enough for future recommendations .
89274	0	a	Okay .
89275	0	a	Yeah , but it will it will it will be cause a lot of problems .
89276	0	a	The sample sensor sample speaker .
89277	0	a	What is it m is that the speaker we were t
89278	0	a	I do not know what it is .
89279	0	a	I do not know it either .
89280	0	a	I do not know .
89281	0	a	Okay , we went for the double curved case made out of plastic and rubber .
89282	0	a	Yes .
89283	0	a	And with a special colour .
89284	0	a	I guess that is what we were
89285	0	a	Yeah , I do not know about the special colour ,
89286	0	a	but I think w
89287	0	a	Yeah , I think we we have special colours .
89288	0	a	Well , special colour .
89289	0	a	Otherwise , you get a standard plastic colour .
89290	0	a	I do not know if it is very special .
89291	0	a	I do not
89292	0	a	okay .
89293	0	a	Standard rubber .
89294	0	a	Alright , that is okay .
89295	0	a	Okay , then the push button , I was just counting them .
89296	0	a	St
89297	0	a	Yes .
89298	0	a	, I think you have to indicate the amount of push buttons we want to use ,
89299	0	a	is not it ?
89300	0	a	Well that is bit of a problem , because I re
89301	0	a	but I really do not understand that , because I can imagine a remote control with far more push buttons , and it would not be possible according to this sheet .
89302	0	a	Whoa ,
89303	0	a	it is a little
89304	0	a	That is huge .
89305	0	a	No .
89306	0	a	We have the simplest buttons .
89307	0	a	No .
89308	0	a	No ,
89309	0	a	it is only when you use push buttons , it will cost that much .
89310	0	a	Yeah .
89311	0	a	I do not think so , because it says amount .
89312	0	a	If you use a scroll wheel
89313	0	a	Maybe it is the kind of push buttons .
89314	0	a	Yeah , it would not
89315	0	a	Fill in the number of components you plan to use in the and the total cost I do not know .
89316	0	a	The the the yellow row is the amount of
89317	0	a	To n
89318	0	a	that is total of four buttons .
89319	0	a	I
89320	0	a	And I count them like this .
89321	0	a	You can have f four kind of push buttons .
89322	0	a	Rubber .
89323	0	a	, one til nine .
89324	0	a	You can have
89325	0	a	Different ,
89326	0	a	yes .
89327	0	a	Is that one or is that nine buttons ?
89328	0	a	Yeah .
89329	0	a	One two three four five six
89330	0	a	seven eight
89331	0	a	nine ten eleven twelve and thirteen .
89332	0	a	Because Oh , this is
89333	0	a	oh , this is one , okay .
89334	0	a	Twelve , okay , then it would be eighteen , because , I rated them as as separate buttons .
89335	0	a	Yes .
89336	0	a	And plus these two , f plus the mute button , and it is will be eighteen .
89337	0	a	I think that
89338	0	a	Eighteen .
89339	0	a	One two three four five , si
89340	0	a	Fifty cents for one single stupid button .
89341	0	a	Why is that so expensive .
89342	0	a	Yeah , I do not understand .
89343	0	a	Y I do
89344	0	a	I do not get the point , because it is would be s relatively so expensive ,
89345	0	a	just these m small buttons .
89346	0	a	Is it cents , the the the fifty cents a button ?
89347	0	a	No way .
89348	0	a	So , whe when you so then it
89349	0	a	It is eighty percent of the price of the of the amount of
89350	0	a	When you have the same amount of button , you have to put in wi in your carton .
89351	1	a	Well , okay , well well let is make it just one .
89352	0	a	Here , now it is now it is already s
89353	1	a	shall we just give our own interpretation to ,
89354	0	a	because else we would really have a problem .
89355	0	a	Yeah , exactly .
89356	0	a	Yeah .
89357	0	a	It would be impossible to make it
89358	0	a	And and less buttons than this is not possible .
89359	0	a	I ca not
89360	0	a	I I
89361	0	a	I could not understand it if it was fifty cents per per button .
89362	0	a	It is way
89363	0	a	No , no no .
89364	0	a	Really .
89365	0	a	Board .
89366	0	a	Yeah ,
89367	0	a	yeah ,
89368	0	a	No , really .
89369	0	a	And then throw it
89370	0	a	But whe
89371	0	a	I have seen one one remote control with only the pu
89372	0	a	yeah , only with page up , page down and volume ,
89373	0	a	but but
89374	0	a	, it is it is still for little children .
89375	0	a	This is the most simple
89376	0	a	yeah , it is possible ,
89377	0	a	but I have never seen one before .
89378	0	a	Yeah , without the numbers .
89379	0	a	That is possible .
89380	0	a	Yeah ,
89381	0	a	That is still four .
89382	1	a	Yeah , we could skip the numbers .
89383	0	a	Yeah ,
89384	0	a	but I d I would not want to own that .
89385	0	a	Really .
89386	0	a	They can handle that remote control ,
89387	0	a	but but it is not fo
89388	0	a	Yes ,
89389	0	a	it is for it is li
89390	0	a	it is just for a little
89391	0	a	Otherwise , it Otherwise it would be the
89392	0	a	Special form also , it says .
89393	0	a	Yeah .
89394	0	a	Then , teletext would also be im impossible .
89395	0	a	Yeah , that is no option , that is no option .
89396	0	a	Okay , we will we will just
89397	0	a	okay .
89398	0	a	But then still , when we there is no room for a docking station or something .
89399	0	a	Tha w Le
89400	0	a	let is see th we have
89401	0	a	oh yeah
89402	0	a	, button supplements .
89403	1	a	We will give the buttons special colour .
89404	0	a	We will give them a special form .
89405	1	a	, I think we should mark the special form thing ,
89406	0	a	because it this will be some special forms incorporated in these big buttons , I guess .
89407	0	a	A special colour , why a special colour ?
89408	0	a	But wha what s what special ?
89409	0	a	Okay , yeah .
89410	0	a	Because the buttons will be d will be matching colour between the buttons and the rubber surroundings .
89411	0	a	I think that is the what they mean by a special colour .
89412	0	a	I do not think the special form is really true .
89413	0	a	, yeah .
89414	0	a	I think all the special colour things have to be marked over here , because that is what we were planning to do ,
89415	0	a	making it
89416	0	a	Yeah , special material r also ,
89417	0	a	because i has rubber .
89418	0	a	Is it ?
89419	0	a	Yeah , I dunno .
89420	0	a	And the buttons have to be rubber .
89421	0	a	What is the normal material ?
89422	0	a	Sh yeah .
89423	0	a	Plastic .
89424	0	a	Plastic , I think .
89425	0	a	Classic ?
89426	0	a	Oh , plastic .
89427	0	a	Plastic .
89428	0	a	Plastic .
89429	0	a	Kay , but the problem now is that the There is no such thing as a docking station in this list , but we can all imagine that it would be impossible to make a docking station for thirty cents .
89430	0	a	Yeah .
89431	1	a	But we can sell the remote control and sell the docking station
89432	0	a	yes .
89433	0	a	Separately .
89434	0	a	Se no no no .
89435	0	a	And and
89436	1	a	but we do not have to tell it , but what we can say of can almost make it impossible to buy a remote control without the docking station .
89437	0	a	Yeah ,
89438	0	a	yeah .
89439	0	a	Yeah , but I do like the idea , but we yeah .
89440	0	a	It but it
89441	0	a	then the docking station is not relevant for this project anymore ,
89442	0	a	but we can
89443	0	a	but then you still have to use
89444	0	a	we have to find out what chip we u need .
89445	0	a	No .
89446	0	a	No ,
89447	0	a	but you otherwise you ca not retrieve it .
89448	0	a	Yeah , I really do not get it .
89449	0	a	I mean if it is a simple chip , then we suddenly got two Euros and thirty cents .
89450	0	a	I think we can agree on this .
89451	0	a	I I think the special colour thing has to be marked .
89452	0	a	Cause I think we
89453	0	a	Yeah , I think that is what what what they mean
89454	1	a	But can we find out about this chips ?
89455	0	a	Because when we do not need a d a docking station , then probably we also have only we also need a simple chip .
89456	0	a	Yeah , yep .
89457	0	a	But for two Euros and thirty cents , we we do not get a docking station .
89458	0	a	I think so , too .
89459	0	a	Oh , I do not know .
89460	1	a	And then we can get a docking station .
89461	1	a	And maybe then we can do something extra .
89462	0	a	For
89463	0	a	For two Euros .
89464	0	a	Oh , n oh , still
89465	0	a	oh , it is going to get more expensive with .
89466	0	a	Two .
89467	0	a	Then we have some money left .
89468	0	a	We can put then
89469	1	a	We can put a scroll wheel on it or something .
89470	0	a	Yeah , well who knows .
89471	0	a	why ?
89472	0	a	I mean i i
89473	0	a	if you
89474	0	a	if it would cost two Euros , that had a total a total thing , it would be nice too ,
89475	0	a	I mean we are not going to add a trip to Hawaii to it .
89476	1	a	Or a little bit of tin titanium .
89477	1	a	But what what can we do
89478	0	a	But what can we do with the simple chip and what is difference with a regular chip and a advanced chip ?
89479	0	a	If if i
89480	0	a	Regular chip and
89481	0	a	because we do not have special functions to use in advanced chip , for example .
89482	0	a	Yeah ,
89483	1	a	or we can ki do the kinetic cells .
89484	0	a	That is also maybe an idea .
89485	0	a	Yeah that is what then what he has to find out .
89486	1	a	Maybe you can find it in your email right now ,
89487	0	a	then we know
89488	0	a	then we exactly know what it will cost us .
89489	0	a	Maybe is that
89490	0	a	that is nice to know .
89491	0	a	Yeah , bu bu but when we
89492	0	a	yeah ,
89493	0	a	but when we skip when we when we do not use the do we are not going to make the docking station ,
89494	0	a	then we still
89495	0	a	yeah , we need something else maybe to make it kind of special ,
89496	0	a	because that was our our special feature .
89497	0	a	I like the hand dynamo part .
89498	1	a	We can make a plain docking station for two Euros .
89499	0	a	Yeah .
89500	1	a	We will go back tomorrow .
89501	0	a	I mean
89502	1	a	Wi wi without recharge
89503	0	a	Yeah ,
89504	1	a	but but we can make a docking station for two Euros if you do not put the recharge function in it .
89505	0	a	Yeah , okay , you can also do that ,
89506	0	a	but maybe
89507	0	a	It still is a special remote control cons you know , wi its form is special and material .
89508	0	a	I mean , it has a shape .
89509	0	a	Yeah , but for two Euros , then we have still
89510	0	a	maybe we have to use the advanced chip ,
89511	0	a	then two Euros is not even possible .
89512	0	a	Of course it has a shape , but i i
89513	0	a	Why should that not be possible ?
89514	0	a	No ,
89515	0	a	for for the for the docking station if you do if you choose the simple chip .
89516	0	a	Yeah , then
89517	0	a	because then we would thirty cents left .
89518	0	a	Yeah ,
89519	0	a	but yeah , I do not know ,
89520	0	a	because maybe d yeah ,
89521	1	a	we have to find out with the simple chip .
89522	0	a	That is the question .
89523	0	a	If we do i do we need an advanced chip , or is it
89524	0	a	okay
89525	0	a	f
89526	0	a	No .
89527	0	a	Yes .
89528	0	a	Yeah ,
89529	0	a	and w and and we need f
89530	0	a	and what is this ?
89531	0	a	Sample sensor sample speaker .
89532	0	a	It is not in my information , so I do not know it either .
89533	0	a	It is not in my information ,
89534	0	a	I I
89535	0	a	I have got a schematic view of the remote control , but nothing about advanced chips or I have got here in
89536	1	a	I will put a
89537	1	a	I will put a page on it .
89538	1	a	You can look at it for s presentation .
89539	0	a	S technical functions ?
89540	0	a	Oh .
89541	0	a	No no , they were mine , yeah .
89542	0	a	When my mouse works again .
89543	0	a	Oh , oh oh .
89544	0	a	Hey .
89545	0	a	Oh .
89546	0	a	My mouse is
89547	0	a	Yes .
89548	0	a	Dead .
89549	1	a	Reanimate it .
89550	0	a	Oh .
89551	0	a	Died .
89552	0	a	, I have got it .
89553	1	a	I will put my email on the the network .
89554	0	a	What the hell are these ?
89555	0	a	Oh , whatever .
89556	0	a	It is on it .
89557	0	a	Yeah , it is open .
89558	0	a	I do not think here it is in here already .
89559	0	a	It is circuit board .
89560	0	a	It is only just basics for for At the end circuit there is an infrared LED .
89561	0	a	It is nothing about s
89562	0	a	yeah .
89563	0	a	Yes .
89564	0	a	This is not helpful .
89565	0	a	No .
89566	0	a	But i in the presentation of yours , there was also something about different components .
89567	0	a	Which one was it ?
89568	0	a	Functional requirements ?
89569	0	a	Components design .
89570	0	a	Yes , that was mine .
89571	0	a	No , that was my presentation .
89572	0	a	Components design maybe .
89573	0	a	N on top .
89574	0	a	yes , it was the second one .
89575	0	a	But that was my second
89576	0	a	But this is the same
89577	0	a	This is o only the possibilities .
89578	0	a	Yeah , it was your second your first presentation .
89579	0	a	It is already open .
89580	0	a	It is at the bottom .
89581	0	a	Working design .
89582	0	a	Sorry ?
89583	0	a	, this is n this is not this n
89584	0	a	that is not the right one .
89585	0	a	It is at your task bar .
89586	0	a	Yeah , but it is the the other one .
89587	0	a	Oh .
89588	0	a	Was it working design or components design ?
89589	0	a	Chip set .
89590	0	a	Sorry .
89591	0	a	I do not
89592	0	a	oh .
89593	0	a	Okay , sorry .
89594	0	a	No , this is the other one .
89595	0	a	Or maybe something is
89596	0	a	maybe there is something abo in in these
89597	0	a	Here .
89598	0	a	Yeah .
89599	0	a	We can use a simple , a regular , or advanced chip .
89600	0	a	Yeah , nice .
89601	0	a	The display requires an advanced chip .
89602	0	a	I it does not say anything .
89603	0	a	You know that a push button requires a simple chip , but a scroll wheel , it it
89604	0	a	me requires
89605	0	a	Okay , so we only need a simple chip .
89606	0	a	, okay .
89607	0	a	Requires .
89608	0	a	With the light .
89609	0	a	Little lights .
89610	0	a	Yeah , but that that is just the same as the the LED .
89611	0	a	No no , that is just a simple chip .
89612	0	a	That is not needed .
89613	0	a	A scroll wheel
89614	0	a	it s only states that a scroll wheel requires a regular chip , and that a display requires an advanced chip .
89615	0	a	So , we do not need any of them .
89616	0	a	A display is , of course , for showing letters .
89617	0	a	LCD .
89618	0	a	For showing text .
89619	0	a	Yeah .
89620	0	a	I do not think that just a l a little light
89621	0	a	Yeah , I agree .
89622	0	a	No .
89623	0	a	I think the normal simple chip will be okay .
89624	0	a	And what is the sample sensor slash sample speaker ?
89625	0	a	Okay .
89626	0	a	Maybe you can say against the remote page f page up , page down .
89627	0	a	Yeah .
89628	0	a	Yeah , I guess so too .
89629	0	a	Yeah , true .
89630	0	a	Next channel .
89631	0	a	Well , that is not too what we want .
89632	0	a	No .
89633	0	a	Well , we might want it , but
89634	0	a	Yeah .
89635	0	a	All in twelve Euros .
89636	1	a	Back to the costs .
89637	0	a	Twelve Euros and fifty cents .
89638	1	a	So we are going to use the simple chip .
89639	0	a	So , simple chip is okay .
89640	0	a	Great .
89641	0	a	Delete .
89642	0	a	Yeah .
89643	0	a	And the lights .
89644	0	a	Where are the lights ?
89645	0	a	But but sometimes you put a
89646	0	a	Kinetics are not nowadays only used in watches and that is because you are always walking .
89647	0	a	Yeah , lights , yeah ,
89648	0	a	there is no category .
89649	0	a	Well , there are three , I guess .
89650	0	a	Nah , there is some money left to be spent .
89651	0	a	Can we do it wi within two two Euro ?
89652	0	a	I think we can make a docking station .
89653	0	a	Okay , but what we have to think about now is that is is it still a special remote control ?
89654	0	a	But I mean it is not
89655	0	a	it has not got any innovative technology , we are not going to apply any innovated innovative te technology anyway , I think .
89656	0	a	Yeah .
89657	0	a	I do not I do not see any possibility to do so , because it would would not fit our defi design philosophy .
89658	0	a	But it is original .
89659	0	a	But what w is there some extra
89660	0	a	maybe I think maybe the kinetic thing is something .
89661	0	a	No , that is true .
89662	0	a	Instead of the rechargeable
89663	0	a	the rechargeable thing was something to know , so y so people would not have to worry about their batteries anymore .
89664	0	a	M bu
89665	0	a	Or the hand dynamo dynamo
89666	0	a	Yeah .
89667	1	a	Maybe we if we put the kinetic thing in it
89668	0	a	Yeah , you leave the p
89669	0	a	yeah
89670	0	a	, I know , but still I they will think about that .
89671	0	a	I mean if you u The it is made for s people well , the they do not
89672	0	a	if it was r useless technology , they would not put it as a possibility .
89673	0	a	solar cells are useless .
89674	0	a	And i it it th th the the target
89675	0	a	the target group are people who zap regularly and throw with their remote control as a matter of speaking .
89676	0	a	Because I think it when when there w was a remote control where it was useful to have a kinetic power source , then it would be this one .
89677	0	a	Because it is one it gets thrown around thrown around a lot and it gets used a lot
89678	0	a	Hey that maybe that is cool that is a cool thing about it , you know .
89679	0	a	Yeah ,
89680	0	a	but but if we ca I do not know if
89681	0	a	Five minutes .
89682	0	a	You do not use batteries .
89683	0	a	I have never seen it before in a remote control .
89684	1	a	But then we could make a docking station .
89685	0	a	No , we we we ca not make a docking station anyway .
89686	0	a	That is not true .
89687	0	a	Yeah , we can als or also m
89688	0	a	we we can make one we can still make
89689	0	a	Yeah , but be serious , then the docking station will be a fifth of the price of the remote control .
89690	0	a	We can make a docking station for two thirty .
89691	0	a	Wow , w why no li
89692	0	a	Look at now , we got two
89693	0	a	two thirty left .
89694	0	a	Two thirty .
89695	0	a	Fo for a docking station .
89696	0	a	We can make a docking station .
89697	0	a	Ca ca not we make a docking station of that ?
89698	0	a	I do not know .
89699	0	a	Sure .
89700	0	a	With a cable , with buttons on it , with retrieval device in it .
89701	0	a	Sure .
89702	0	a	The power device is is i i is very cheap .
89703	0	a	That is just a regular power cable and whatever .
89704	0	a	Wi with a button to
89705	0	a	wi with a button to retrieve it , so it will beep .
89706	0	a	Well , we we
89707	0	a	Yeah , then we do not have any innovation things .
89708	0	a	So .
89709	0	a	, so it is wireless technology .
89710	0	a	Yeah .
89711	0	a	Yeah ,
89712	0	a	but we we do not inc
89713	0	a	we have not looked at the these costs of the speaker and other stuff .
89714	0	a	I do not think it is realistic for you to do so .
89715	0	a	Well then it is a useless project .
89716	0	a	Look at the case ,
89717	0	a	the case the case of of of
89718	0	a	No , then we have to sell it for thirty Euros .
89719	0	a	Oh , because we
89720	0	a	We well look at all the special stuff we have .
89721	0	a	Colour a the colours are special , the form is special .
89722	0	a	It th this is whole concept .
89723	1	a	maybe it with the kinetic thing , I think we could do do a compromise with the kim kinetic thing .
89724	0	a	Ca not we
89725	1	a	Ca not we say fifteen Euros ?
89726	0	a	No , sta
89727	0	a	yeah
89728	0	a	I mean
89729	0	a	No .
89730	0	a	, no .
89731	0	a	No , we only make less profit of it .
89732	0	a	It is the
89733	1	a	Maybe we can can do it both .
89734	1	a	You can sell for twenty seven and a half .
89735	0	a	Then you make as much profit as you would with twelve and a half production costs .
89736	0	a	No .
89737	0	a	Yeah , I don
89738	1	a	my suggestion is to just forget about the whole docking station thing
89739	0	a	and make it like a I
89740	0	a	I
89741	0	a	I
89742	0	a	I still fee
89743	1	a	I also feel this concept of making it kinetic ,
89744	0	a	because of the you know , it g it gives something dynamic to the remote control .
89745	0	a	I do not think
89746	0	a	No .
89747	1	a	Maybe we can do it both in the in the in the remote .
89748	1	a	Battery and kinetic .
89749	0	a	No , that would not n no .
89750	0	a	Thirteen twenty .
89751	0	a	Yeah , and it is also not a good it is not
89752	0	a	you have to really do it only kinetic , you do not want it to think about batteries anymore .
89753	0	a	And I think only Yeah , but only kinetic , then you gotta
89754	0	a	You you gotta throw throw it through the room like twenty times an hour , really .
89755	0	a	Yes , but when it is then when it
89756	0	a	then you have to shake it and all when it is when it is empty .
89757	0	a	No no .
89758	0	a	Yeah , it is great .
89759	0	a	No no no .
89760	0	a	No no , this is very sophisticated technology technology .
89761	0	a	When you use it your remote like once a day , or maybe even less
89762	0	a	i i it
89763	0	a	It We can make it
89764	0	a	yeah no .
89765	0	a	You asked for three d
89766	0	a	No , that is n that is not true .
89767	0	a	, a watch is kinetic because you walk all the time .
89768	0	a	No .
89769	0	a	Becau be but a remote control gets
89770	0	a	why do they state that this technology can be used if it
89771	0	a	Yeah , m but a w n a calculator also works on r on solar cells .
89772	0	a	Yes , solar cells are also stated .
89773	1	a	Why do not we use solar cells then ?
89774	0	a	That is true .
89775	0	a	Because I think the d whole dynamic part , do you know , appeals to me qui thinking of our design philosophy , you know , with the rubber parts and sturdiness of the thing , and
89776	0	a	y when you move it around a lot , then people find the idea funny
89777	0	a	that
89778	0	a	when I move my remote control around and Yeah
89779	0	a	, but you do not have to .
89780	0	a	Yeah , it is funny for a week .
89781	0	a	I guess something like that , where you have to move it around very frequently , is demotivating .
89782	0	a	Trust me .
89783	0	a	The idea of this technology is that you do not think about it , it just happens .
89784	0	a	No , I I do not move my my remote control very much , seriously .
89785	0	a	Okay , then we d
89786	0	a	Okay , well y we do not have to do it , but what that would just have a lack of key features , you know .
89787	0	a	Oui .
89788	0	a	You m have to put something on your box .
89789	0	a	You have to make people buy it and
89790	1	a	We can really can do the docking thing ,
89791	0	a	it is not
89792	0	a	yeah , we can do it , but it is would be a easy way out .
89793	0	a	You can do it for fifty cents .
89794	0	a	Well , we have got more than fifty Cents .
89795	0	a	The c
89796	0	a	The case the case alone is is is
89797	0	a	the case alone for remote control is at least one Euro .
89798	1	a	Okay , but we have to grou to agree upon something ,
89799	0	a	because we only have a minute left or so .
89800	0	a	Then we have one Euro thirty for the whole docking station .
89801	0	a	No no , it is not possible .
89802	1	a	Okay , w b we can s we can leave it on
89803	0	a	be well then then th it is this is
89804	0	a	then then our concept is ready .
89805	0	a	Cheap remote control .
89806	0	a	Yeah , we make some extra profit of it .
89807	0	a	Yeah .
89808	0	a	No , we wo not , but that is something else .
89809	0	a	But now
89810	0	a	Great .
89811	0	a	No , this not going to sell .
89812	0	a	It w it wo not tell , but
89813	0	a	No , , n no
89814	1	a	Yeah , we just have to go all what we did today again .
89815	1	a	Huh , any ideas ?
89816	0	a	No no there is still there is still someth concept and something special left .
89817	0	a	No .
89818	0	a	Of course not .
89819	0	a	It is great .

89829	0	a	I mean we are going to
89830	0	a	it is going to excel in in on in the the range in the field of design and and looks and feel .
89831	0	a	That is what it is makes it special .
89832	0	a	Yeah , and I would li
89833	0	a	I would have liked a kinetic part as well , to give it some just to give it some extra special feature , and I know it will work ,
89834	0	a	but it is it is an
89835	0	a	They are they are not putting technologies on this , but if it if it was impossible to to make it happen .

89887	1	a	Right let is see it .
89888	0	a	So it is in the project documents because that is what we can find here .
89889	0	a	Well .
89890	0	a	Very nice .
89891	0	a	Well this is called the the the kick off meeting .
89892	0	a	So I am the Project Manager , so I had to fill it in ,
89893	0	a	and .
89894	0	a	Kay .
89895	0	a	Oh sorry .
89896	0	a	And an a nice agenda .
89897	0	a	we will do the opening and then we will meet each other , what we already do ,
89898	0	a	so , that is not very much trouble .
89899	0	a	I will I will show you the the tools we have here , so that we can all use them .
89900	0	a	Then we will look at the project plan from Real Reaction .
89901	0	a	We will discuss about our first ideas about the project , and then we will close the meeting , and then we can individually do our things and then we will get back here .
89902	0	a	So this the opening we will
89903	0	a	We have to design a new television remote control .
89904	0	a	You have heard that already I think , so .
89905	0	a	we want it to be original , so a nice a nice new design .
89906	0	a	trendy , it is also for young people , and we have to just make it modern .
89907	0	a	And friendly , so size does matter .
89908	0	a	And Well it has to be a have the the right the right buttons on the right place , that kin those kind of things .
89909	0	a	Other
89910	0	a	There happen to be three stages .
89911	0	a	functional , conceptual , and d detailed design .
89912	0	a	so every time we we will do some individual work , get meeting , talk about it , and then go into the next phase .
89913	0	a	That is just it .
89914	0	a	We have these two Smartboards .
89915	0	a	well as I just showed , there is a project management folder , a project document folder on the desktop .
89916	0	a	It just works exactly the same as a computer .
89917	0	a	You just click on the on the folder and you open the everything you you put in it with your laptop .
89918	0	a	So you can make Words Excel , everything .
89919	0	a	and the w the r the rest also works the same so when you open a notepad you you just get your things , you can draw .
89920	0	a	This is a well a drawing board .
89921	0	a	you have a these different functions on the board .
89922	0	a	You can see them there .
89923	0	a	So you have a a nice pen , and it is works just like a bal ball pen .
89924	0	a	This is just a .
89925	0	a	I want to
89926	0	a	Oh yeah .
89927	0	a	Of course w does not work any more .
89928	1	a	Maybe you should try to write on the on the big white
89929	0	a	Does it ?
89930	0	a	Yeah .
89931	0	a	Yes I will
89932	0	a	eraser so .
89933	0	a	It works .
89934	0	a	It is fantas fantastic .
89935	0	a	Wonderful .
89936	0	a	We can well you can save a file .
89937	0	a	So if we draw we have to save everything .
89938	0	a	Do not throw anything away .
89939	0	a	just we can start a new one , and we just go on , and do not throw anything away .
89940	0	a	Just let them all stand here .
89941	0	a	We can delete , but we do not do that .
89942	0	a	you can here select a pen , you can draw anything you want .
89943	0	a	It is a bit childish you have to write .
89944	0	a	It is not as fast as you w you know it ,
89945	0	a	but it does work sometimes .
89946	0	a	Well it is just like a normal paint .
89947	0	a	So it is gone .
89948	0	a	Alright , yep .
89949	0	a	Well we are designers , so we have to have a a more a Smartboard .
89950	0	a	So that is fantastic .
89951	0	a	well this speaks for itself .
89952	0	a	We going to try it .
89953	0	a	So we all are going to draw a nice animal on this board , not my idea .

89961	0	a	w I dunno
89962	0	a	what I am going to design .
89963	0	a	Oh does not
89964	0	a	oh .
89965	0	a	I hope this was part of the assignment and not your
89966	0	a	I hope this was part of the assignment and not your personal enjoyment .
89967	0	a	Yeah , kay .
89968	0	a	I just said it is not my idea
89969	0	a	but I am the Project Manager , and officially this is my idea .

89971	0	a	I
89972	0	a	I
89973	0	a	I

89984	0	a	so start
89985	0	a	Yep yes .
89986	0	a	Sh
89987	0	a	I hope our Industrial Designer does this better
89988	0	a	because this is No
89989	0	a	so a a few legs .
89990	0	a	Do not count on it .
89991	0	a	Do we have to guess ?

89993	0	a	Yeah .
89994	0	a	Yes yes
89995	1	a	guess .

90007	0	a	Well I am amazed about your drawing skills .
90008	0	a	Our characteristics sum it up .
90009	0	a	Well it is very painful
90010	0	a	those kind of thing .
90011	0	a	So we can just

90084	1	a	will choose a new colour and a new pen width so w we can all see it .
90085	0	a	Here you go .
90086	0	a	Why do I have to do the difficult tasks ?

90109	0	a	So .
90110	0	a	Just a wa that is the way we do

90113	1	a	It is a cat .
90114	0	a	Oh Pussy .

90128	0	a	Right .
90129	0	a	well I think it is obvious right now .
90130	0	a	Yes alright .
90131	0	a	It is a cat .
90132	0	a	No it looks great .
90133	0	a	Miaow .
90134	0	a	Well if this is not obvious
90135	1	a	I will save it alright save .
90136	0	a	Well well
90137	0	a	Yeah
90138	1	a	save it and start a new blank document .
90139	1	a	Just save it .
90140	0	a	yeah blank .
90141	0	a	Yep .
90142	0	a	So that is what we are going to use when we need it .
90143	0	a	Well I feel comfortable now .
90144	0	a	Oh great .
90145	0	a	Well it is terrific , eh ?
90146	0	a	Yeah that is it .
90147	0	a	Thanks for this exercise .
90148	0	a	It is good for group spirit .
90149	0	a	I feel totally at ease .
90150	0	a	It certainly is .
90151	0	a	We are one big happy family now .
90152	0	a	Yeah something like that .
90153	0	a	Well then the serious stuff .
90154	0	a	We are we want to sell it at twenty five Euros internationally
90155	0	a	so
90156	0	a	but we dunno what exactly th
90157	0	a	i
90158	0	a	it is in dollars , but twenty five Euros .
90159	0	a	Our profit aim is , worldwide , fifty million Euros .
90160	0	a	So
90161	0	a	Alright .
90162	0	a	So I did not exactly calculate how much we have to sell .
90163	0	a	we want to keep it our costs at twelve and a half Euros
90164	1	a	so , keep that in mind when we talk about our materials an f and stuff , and marketing research .
90165	0	a	Right .
90166	0	a	Now then we all we can sit down and discuss what do we think about our current remote controls , first about design about aim in the market etcetera ?
90167	0	a	Well we c we can sit down because presentation can wait .
90168	0	a	Right .
90169	1	a	We can take notes and
90170	1	a	Well who has some remarks about the current remote controls ?
90171	1	a	Please ?
90172	0	a	No I did .
90173	0	a	Well I I did not have to prepare anything about it
90174	0	a	is not
90175	0	a	, it is it is not my task to talk about experience with current remote controls ,
90176	0	a	but
90177	0	a	Well just w we are four if we if we would just have one then
90178	0	a	Yeah .
90179	1	a	I think it is im
90180	1	a	it is important to look at the remote controls of our competitors .
90181	1	a	Get the good points try to merge them into one universal remote control .
90182	1	a	Yeah yeah .
90183	0	a	On our corporate site I saw a new DVD player we are going to produce .
90184	0	a	Yep .
90185	1	a	Maybe it is important to make it compatible with the DVD player so you can use your television and your DVD player with the same remote control .
90186	0	a	That is alright .
90187	0	a	That would be a nice idea , yes .
90188	0	a	Yep
90189	0	a	yep yep .
90190	0	a	Furthermore it is important to make it acceptable for the whole world , for different cultures , maybe , because we want to we want to well fifty million ?
90191	0	a	Yeah yeah
90192	0	a	so a lot of people have to be able to use it .
90193	0	a	Yes fifty million is our aim to a profit , so .
90194	0	a	No but the b the buttons have to have to have international recognisable buttons and and numbers and that every culture in , yeah , people in every country can recognise .
90195	0	a	So
90196	0	a	Yeah .
90197	0	a	Easy to learn .
90198	0	a	Yeah that is right .
90199	0	a	Yeah .
90200	0	a	Yes .
90201	0	a	Yeah .
90202	1	a	I will make notes
90203	0	a	and then maybe
90204	1	a	well I will put it in the project folder when I am done just now .
90205	0	a	Alright .
90206	0	a	I also think we should not add too many buttons .
90207	0	a	No that is right .
90208	0	a	Right .
90209	0	a	Modern day remotes have too much buttons I think .
90210	0	a	Y y
90211	0	a	you do not use the half of them that is that is
90212	0	a	culture international .
90213	0	a	Precisely .
90214	1	a	Maybe we could make one button to switch between DVD player and TV and make the other buttons multi functional or something .
90215	0	a	Yeah .
90216	0	a	Yeah indeed .
90217	0	a	Yes .
90218	0	a	Yeah
90219	0	a	so it does not become too complicated with too much buttons and
90220	1	a	And stereo s audio installations .
90221	0	a	Yeah right .
90222	0	a	Yep ,
90223	1	a	and maybe we do we even have more than just a DVD player .
90224	0	a	Do not we have other ou
90225	0	a	Yeah
90226	1	a	we should make it compatible perhaps with everything we use , we we make ?
90227	0	a	Yeah .
90228	0	a	We also just released a TFT thing I saw .
90229	0	a	Yeah
90230	0	a	so but th that is kind kind of standard T television
90231	0	a	so it also works on that .
90232	0	a	Yeah .
90233	0	a	Yep .
90234	0	a	And I think the people who who will buy our remote already have some experience with remotes .
90235	1	a	So we can keep that in mind .
90236	0	a	Most people do , yeah .
90237	0	a	Well yeah .
90238	0	a	It does not it does not have to be
90239	0	a	Yeah .
90240	0	a	It does not have to be , but we can .
90241	0	a	W
90242	0	a	well it is
90243	0	a	a n it is a new remote
90244	0	a	and you do not buy a remote if you do not have anything to to control with it .
90245	1	a	Well except if we deliver it together with our DVD .
90246	0	a	Yeah
90247	0	a	but
90248	0	a	We need to to keep it consistent with other d
90249	0	a	Yeah
90250	0	a	but it is it has to be useable .
90251	0	a	Yeah alright , but
90252	0	a	Yeah .
90253	0	a	Yeah
90254	0	a	because we look at competitors
90255	1	a	and w if we pick up the good things about that and give it a nice design
90256	0	a	Yes .
90257	0	a	Well .
90258	1	a	It has to be different and familiar at the same time .
90259	0	a	Yeah .
90260	0	a	Yeah
90261	1	a	we could use another form or shape or colour , that kind of things .
90262	0	a	Yep .
90263	0	a	yeah the shape will will have to be recognised .
90264	0	a	I thought about like most remote controls are a long box shaped thing
90265	1	a	you can make it triangle shaped ,
90266	0	a	but that is not very recognisable .
90267	0	a	Yeah .
90268	1	a	Well we we could make more more oval or something , and and
90269	0	a	Yeah
90270	0	a	or so
90271	0	a	Well yeah
90272	0	a	it is new .
90273	0	a	Oo
90274	1	a	N we can use it as a as a game pad .
90275	0	a	No .
90276	0	a	Oval ?
90277	0	a	I
90278	1	a	So one hand has the beer , so the other hand
90279	0	a	Well i we already
90280	0	a	one of our aims is that it has to be original and trendy
90281	0	a	so
90282	0	a	Well there has been done a lot of researches about remotes we have to
90283	0	a	we can imagine because it is a long time on the market .
90284	0	a	Not with two hands .
90285	0	a	Yeah
90286	0	a	yeah
90287	0	a	yeah
90288	0	a	, right .
90289	0	a	No
90290	0	a	Yeah but it is quite important that it fits .
90291	0	a	but young people want something different
90292	0	a	and it is
90293	0	a	Yeah .
90294	0	a	Yeah .
90295	0	a	Oh but it ha it has to be m
90296	0	a	yeah .
90297	0	a	But you still have to know it is a remote and not another
90298	0	a	Yeah .
90299	0	a	Yeah alright .
90300	0	a	So the the form will have been tested out so
90301	0	a	Yes .
90302	0	a	Yeah
90303	0	a	so the long box shaped thing must be , yeah , useful or else they would have been ano another shape .
90304	0	a	Well
90305	0	a	for me personally I have a a lot of remotes at home but those ones that have a a round ending and well just an square middle
90306	0	a	I do not like to use them .
90307	0	a	I have have to it has to fit my hands .
90308	0	a	Yeah .
90309	0	a	Yeah .
90310	0	a	When it falls over it and I just have and then the button that I use most has to be here .
90311	0	a	It should not be boxy .
90312	0	a	Yeah .
90313	0	a	Yeah
90314	0	a	a lo the long box shape
90315	0	a	yeah .
90316	0	a	You have to use one hand .
90317	0	a	It f it fits your hands and then you just push the button that you use most with thumb .
90318	0	a	Nah
90319	0	a	I do not agree with the long box shape it it has to be custom made for the hand .
90320	0	a	Why not ?
90321	0	a	But it does fit in the hand if you hold it like this , and you can make it another shape ,
90322	0	a	but then you have
90323	0	a	W
90324	0	a	no w
90325	0	a	what else ?
90326	0	a	I di
90327	1	a	Yeah well but what what what do you suggest then ?
90328	0	a	Yeah it does not fit .
90329	0	a	Tho tho those new DVD players on the market do have those .
90330	0	a	Yeah .
90331	0	a	Yeah but if you shape it If
90332	0	a	No that is ol old fashioned .
90333	0	a	No if y if you look at new Phillips DVD with their remotes pl players they they are the new remotes are not box shaped .
90334	0	a	DVD players .
90335	0	a	Yes .
90336	0	a	Well Yeah .
90337	0	a	I can imagine that us
90338	0	a	Yeah right .
90339	0	a	Yes
90340	0	a	Well most of of them are are somewhat thicker at the end , and get
90341	0	a	yeah
90342	0	a	thinner towards the the other end .
90343	0	a	It fits in your palms .
90344	0	a	Well
90345	0	a	but it is still then the the long box , but then with some round round forms in it to fit your hand , but it is it is still
90346	0	a	Yeah
90347	0	a	yeah
90348	0	a	al alright
90349	0	a	but but it is still it is still sort of box ,
90350	0	a	yeah .
90351	0	a	Yeah
90352	0	a	it
90353	0	a	Yeah yea
90354	0	a	Well
90355	0	a	A it h it has it
90356	0	a	it has a
90357	0	a	that is tha th th shape that it fits your hand .
90358	0	a	That is
90359	0	a	We have five minutes left .
90360	0	a	It it has round forms but it in the end it is still the box , so that is what I mean .
90361	0	a	Well
90362	0	a	Yeah but it has it has to fit your hand .
90363	0	a	Yeah
90364	0	a	yeah
90365	0	a	I understand ,
90366	0	a	but no no
90367	0	a	I do not mean an entire box like completely square but a also with round edges of course , but in in in at the end
90368	0	a	it is still this long box shape with convenient round shapes to fit .
90369	1	a	It should not be too boxy , you know .
90370	0	a	It is
90371	0	a	No no no .
90372	0	a	Yeah .
90373	0	a	Right
90374	1	a	maybe something like this and then a button here to switch between different systems like DVD player
90375	0	a	and so you can I have
90376	0	a	Yeah right ,
90377	1	a	and I do think we have to keep this kind of idea with the with the numbers and
90378	0	a	Right .
90379	0	a	Yeah yes
90380	0	a	I thought about something like that .
90381	0	a	Yeah .
90382	1	a	A big recognisable button on top or something .
90383	0	a	Yeah .
90384	0	a	Yes
90385	0	a	that is yep .
90386	1	a	The buttons should also be not too small , not too big , of course , and n not too close together .
90387	1	a	But it should be possible to to make it ap apparent that there are two functions for every button .
90388	0	a	Yep .
90389	1	a	So there has to be some space between the buttons .
90390	0	a	Uh huh .
90391	1	a	Yeah of course to to to have icons to explain the different functions .
90392	0	a	Yeah .
90393	0	a	Yeah right right ,
90394	1	a	and maybe we should use colours .
90395	0	a	Yeah .
90396	0	a	Colours , yeah .
90397	1	a	Yeah maybe we can just like on cell phones
90398	1	a	those well you can you can put on on them , and so you can customise your your own remote with different colours or or special paint jobs
90399	0	a	I dunno but
90400	0	a	Well .
90401	0	a	Yeah .
90402	0	a	Ha .
90403	0	a	That is kind of trendy .
90404	0	a	Yeah right .
90405	0	a	Sound nice .
90406	0	a	Yes .
90407	1	a	I think we have to talk also about the the materials for
90408	0	a	Well it is just about our first ideas now
90409	0	a	so I think individually we will have to come up with ideas for the next meeting about these materials and markets etcetera .
90410	0	a	Right .
90411	0	a	But
90412	1	a	I think it is it is important to notate all the the decisions that we make ,
90413	0	a	so we
90414	0	a	Yeah .
90415	0	a	Already thought about something tha
90416	0	a	Yes ?
90417	0	a	Yes .
90418	0	a	Well thirty minutes we have .
90419	0	a	So
90420	0	a	This is about what we are going to do .
90421	0	a	You will get specific instructions when you are back in your room
90422	0	a	so it is logical .
90423	0	a	I think .
90424	0	a	No problem .
90425	0	a	Oh and that is that is all .
90426	0	a	So we will just get a notice that the the meeting is over .
90427	1	a	Yeah now we can still talk about the material ,
90428	0	a	we have some some minutes left
90429	1	a	I w wrote down that the case should be plastic of course , hard plastic , the buttons should be rubbery I think .
90430	1	a	Yeah yes say .
90431	0	a	Yeah .
90432	1	a	Yeah it should not be too heavy .
90433	0	a	No n
90434	0	a	n
90435	0	a	Well I have had remotes that they had the function of the buttons was about a layer over the buttons and when I have had use it much it was gone .
90436	0	a	Yeah that is bad , yeah .
90437	0	a	Yeah
90438	0	a	yeah
90439	0	a	yeah .
90440	1	a	So it has to be made in the buttons I think .
90441	1	a	It has to not be loose .
90442	0	a	Yeah that is important .
90443	0	a	Alright .
90444	0	a	And of course there are several electrical cables in it to to connect things to each other .
90445	0	a	Yeah .
90446	0	a	Is there an a universal universal way of transmitting from the remote to the television
90447	0	a	so it is all about
90448	0	a	It is not that in China it is different ?
90449	0	a	Yeah .
90450	0	a	Yeah it is univ
90451	0	a	yeah
90452	0	a	yeah
90453	0	a	yeah .
90454	0	a	I think so .
90455	0	a	It is a a common stan standard way infrared beams an infrared beam I think .
90456	0	a	Yep .
90457	0	a	But y you can have of course different between DVDs and televisions and between
90458	0	a	Yeah .
90459	0	a	And you can use
90460	0	a	Yeah .
90461	0	a	It it is a we we make an a universal remote
90462	0	a	so it ha has to work with all kinds of brands and things .
90463	0	a	Yeah .
90464	0	a	But our TVs are mostly made in China and that sort of country , so
90465	0	a	Probably yes .
90466	0	a	China rules .
90467	0	a	And have well yeah
90468	0	a	I have wrote something down about how it works .
90469	0	a	The user presses a button and with an infrared beam it signals the television set accordingly , but that is pretty obvious , I think .
90470	0	a	But are
90471	0	a	Are we going w with the front fronts idea ?
90472	1	a	I think we should make it universal
90473	0	a	and you can always use a front front on it , you know ?
90474	1	a	You can use it just plain but you can To make it more trendy .
90475	1	a	Well I think w we can look into that in the in the next thirty minutes .
90476	0	a	Yeah .
90477	0	a	Yes .
90478	1	a	Well j just y you get a n a normal front with it , but you can change them when you buy the
90479	1	a	And we should dispatch those kind of fronts fronts a a around the world so
90480	0	a	Well th those fifty million do not do not se sells itself so we have to make some extra effort like fronts .
90481	0	a	Yeah .
90482	0	a	Right .
90483	0	a	Yes .
90484	0	a	Right .
90485	0	a	Yes .
90486	0	a	Well you can make profit with them , and it is a way to make them trendy .
90487	0	a	Yeah .
90488	0	a	Well but th but the standard front will be just grey or something b a simple colour not not very flashy .
90489	0	a	Yeah right .
90490	0	a	Yeah alright .
90491	0	a	Yeah normal .
90492	0	a	Yes .
90493	0	a	Yeah well it has to it h
90494	0	a	it has to fit the the te television and DVD
90495	0	a	set we are going to sell , so if they are black and black black and silver
90496	0	a	we will make them black and silver so
90497	0	a	No a colour everyone accepts .
90498	1	a	Pink television sets pink remote , .
90499	0	a	Yeah
90500	0	a	yeah
90501	0	a	yeah .
90502	0	a	Yeah .
90503	0	a	standard .
90504	0	a	But people of often do not like bright colours or something .
90505	0	a	We have to make it grey or s or black .
90506	0	a	Well young people s li
90507	0	a	Yeah yeah ,
90508	0	a	yeah .
90509	0	a	Yeah but then you can use a a front .
90510	0	a	Alright .
90511	0	a	Yeah .
90512	1	a	I must not forget my pen the next time .
90513	0	a	Well if if you
90514	0	a	yeah .
90515	0	a	If you have a a a television room for little children and you make a if if you buy a a pink front they will they will love it .
90516	0	a	Yeah .
90517	0	a	Yeah that is right .
90518	0	a	I think .
90519	1	a	Yeah or a t Teletubby front .
90520	1	a	But that is marketing research you can you can ask .
90521	0	a	Yeah
90522	0	a	yeah
90523	0	a	yeah .
90524	1	a	I will investigate .
90525	0	a	Yes .
90526	1	a	Well our user interface you can maybe I do not know what your specific instructions will be , but probably about the precision of the buttons and and those kind of things and what buttons will have to be on the remote .
90527	0	a	And you will look into the technical design and form , I think .
90528	0	a	yeah also
90529	0	a	the the look and feel of the the remote is also my task , yeah .
90530	0	a	Or something like that .
