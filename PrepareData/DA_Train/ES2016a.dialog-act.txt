A 10.93 Okay . ami_da_2
A 12.03 Oh , that is not going to work . ami_da_16
A 28.01 Oh , alright . ami_da_12
A 35.55 Okay . ami_da_12
A 60.49 Okay . ami_da_12
A 62.85 alright . ami_da_2
A 67.88 I will just put that there . ami_da_16
A 70.24 as you all know we are here to create a brand new fantastic remote . ami_da_4
A 75.1 I am Nick Debusk , I am the Project Manager . ami_da_4
A 80.27 we will just get started with everyone kind of letting each other know who they are and what you are doing , what your what your role is . ami_da_6
A 93.67 Go ahead . ami_da_6
D 94.29 Okay . ami_da_9
D 94.89 I am Corinne Whiting and I will be the Marketing Expert and in each of the three phases I will have a different role . ami_da_4
D 103.0 In the function design phase I will be talking about user requirement specification , and this means what needs and desires are to be fulfilled , and I will be doing research to figure this out . ami_da_4
D 117.9 In the conceptual design phase I will be dealing with trend watching and I will be doing marketing research on the web . ami_da_4
D 125.21 And then finally in the detailed design phase I will be doing product evaluation ami_da_4
D 125.21 and so I will be collecting the requirements and ranking all the requirements to see how we did . ami_da_4
A 138.82 Okay . ami_da_6
C 139.55 Hiya ami_da_14
C 139.55 , I am Ryan . ami_da_4
C 140.7 I am the User Interface Designer . ami_da_4
C 143.23 likewise I have three different roles for each stage of design . ami_da_4
C 148.49 the functional design is looking at the tex technical functions of a remote control . ami_da_4
C 153.65 in the concept design , the user interface , how the user reacts with the the product . ami_da_4
C 160.23 And the detailed design sort of like the user interface design , what they might be looking for , things like fashions , ami_da_4
C 160.23 what makes wha ami_da_3
C 160.23 how we are going to make it special . ami_da_4
C 171.73 That is about it . ami_da_4
B 172.56 Right . ami_da_2
B 173.43 I am Manuel and I am the Industrial Designer in in this project . ami_da_4
B 180.16 In the functional design phase I am I will be dealing mostly with the requirements , we will discuss what the prog what functions the the product has to fulfil and so and so on . ami_da_4
B 192.01 I suppose we will work pretty much together on that one . ami_da_6
B 195.3 in the conceptual design I will be pro mostly dealing with properties and materials of our product . ami_da_4
C 202.18 Yeah . ami_da_9
B 204.03 And the detailed design in the detailed design I will be concerned with the look and feel of the product itself , so we are pretty much working together obviously on the design front here . ami_da_4
B 220.71 Okay . ami_da_4
A 221.21 Okay . ami_da_9
A 224.06 so ami_da_2
A 224.06 we have got our opening , our our agenda is the opening , acquaintance which we have kind of done . ami_da_4
A 233.71 tool training , project plan discussion and then closing . ami_da_4
A 238.69 grand total of twenty five minutes we have here . ami_da_4
A 242.52 so ami_da_2
A 242.52 we are putting together a new remote control . ami_da_4
A 248.19 we want it to be something original . ami_da_4
A 251.5 of course we are a not only a electronics company but a fashion conscious electronics company , so we want it to be trendy and we want it to be easy to use . ami_da_4
A 269.59 we have got the functional design , conceptual design and detailed design which basically is is the three of you . ami_da_4
A 287.68 And w well ami_da_2
A 287.68 functional design . ami_da_3
A 303.04 do we have any ideas of of maybe d ami_da_3
A 303.04 let is just throw out some ideas of what kind of remote control we want to have , and then we can go into how we are going to design it and and how we are going to do the detailing on it . ami_da_6
C 326.84 Yeah . ami_da_2
C 327.05 Well ami_da_2
C 327.05 s ami_da_3
C 327.05 function of remote control is just just ami_da_3
C 327.05 you know , ami_da_2
C 327.05 change channels is its main function . ami_da_4
A 333.56 So ami_da_2
A 333.56 we want it to be a TV remote ami_da_11
A 333.56 or I I mean do we want it to to do other things besides just be a a television remote ? ami_da_11
A 333.56 Okay . ami_da_1
C 343.25 Oh right . ami_da_12
C 343.5 I suppose you c try make it a universal remote ami_da_6
C 343.5 for ami_da_3
C 343.5 could work on all sort of electrical products in in one person is house . ami_da_6
C 356.43 But , you know , they all sorta have the same role changing channels , volumes and then programming . ami_da_4
A 362.67 Okay . ami_da_1
C 365.94 I think they all work on the same prin principle as well ami_da_4
C 365.94 sorta like ami_da_3
C 365.94 I do not actually know . ami_da_4
C 370.34 But is it just infra red ? ami_da_5
C 370.34 Is that standard ? ami_da_5
C 370.34 yeah . ami_da_1
A 372.74 I I think yeah , ami_da_9
A 372.74 yeah , r universal remote . ami_da_9
A 376.86 this is my first go round with creating a remote control , ami_da_4
A 376.86 so ami_da_2
A 376.86 I think we are all in the same boat here . ami_da_14
D 379.04 Huh . ami_da_1
D 383.1 Ours too . ami_da_4
A 388.17 Okay . ami_da_1
C 391.44 one thing I thought of with the remote control is you always lose them . ami_da_4
C 396.55 So if there is a g a way of finding it quite easily , I thought that would be quite good quite a good feature . ami_da_9
D 397.95 Ch ami_da_3
D 397.95 Like a tracking device ? ami_da_6
A 400.16 So we should we should set our remote control up to where it has a like a tracking device ami_da_6
A 400.16 or or like a a ami_da_3
A 400.16 It makes a noise , there is a button on the TV that you press ami_da_6
A 400.16 and ami_da_3
A 400.16 Okay . ami_da_9
C 408.76 Oh you can get those key ami_da_4
C 408.76 well ami_da_2
C 408.76 you could whistle or make a noise and it would beep . ami_da_6
C 415.52 Yeah . ami_da_9
B 416.39 Right . ami_da_12
D 417.92 Be good . ami_da_9
B 419.41 So ami_da_3
C 422.66 Generally , all remotes are sort of quite similar in their appearance . ami_da_4
A 428.68 Yeah . ami_da_9
C 429.52 Just long . ami_da_4
A 429.79 Do we want ami_da_3
A 429.79 so they are kind of like long and rectangular . ami_da_4
C 432.79 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 433.48 Do we want something crazy ? ami_da_11
A 433.48 You know , ami_da_2
A 433.48 we want something new that is going to stand out . ami_da_11
C 433.49 Black usually . ami_da_4
C 435.67 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 436.86 Lot more modern . ami_da_6
C 438.56 I think so . ami_da_9
A 438.63 A m a modern so our remote should be ami_da_3
A 438.63 Okay . ami_da_12
C 441.45 Maybe sorta spherical or something . ami_da_6
C 442.83 A ball . ami_da_6
D 444.77 Maybe like user friendly , ami_da_6
D 444.77 like a little ami_da_3
D 444.77 you know , ami_da_2
D 444.77 where you can use both hands , like a little keyboard type thing . ami_da_6
C 447.13 Yeah . ami_da_9
C 450.25 People ami_da_3
C 450.25 I thought maybe , because people always tend to throw a remote control about the place to one another ami_da_4
C 450.25 if it was in a ball , and maybe the actual controls are inside or something . ami_da_6
B 462.5 Well ami_da_2
B 462.5 there are of course certain restrictions , you ca not have it be any form and fulfil all functions at the same time , so there are always the some restrictions ami_da_4
B 462.5 we have to apply here . ami_da_6
C 468.84 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 473.95 however one question is how stable is that thing supposed to be , ami_da_8
B 473.95 that refers to the material , pretty much . ami_da_4
B 483.02 What are we going to build that thing out of ? ami_da_8
B 483.02 How sturdy is it going to be ? ami_da_8
B 483.02 Do we want it to last longer or rather have people whatever , have to buy one every half a year ? ami_da_11
B 483.02 Right . ami_da_12
A 495.44 Okay so ami_da_2
A 495.44 yeah , ami_da_2
A 495.44 so we want it to be sturdy , we want it to to hold up to somebody is child , you know , throwing it across the room ami_da_6
A 495.44 or , as you said , people kind of throw it , ami_da_4
A 495.44 so ball shaped , you know , if it were ball shaped maybe , ami_da_6
A 495.44 then it ami_da_3
A 495.44 Okay . ami_da_12
C 497.15 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 506.33 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 511.16 It could be cased on the outside and t everything could be inside . ami_da_6
A 516.28 so ami_da_2
A 516.28 we want it to be modern , fun , sturdy , ami_da_6
A 516.28 So our form and our function . ami_da_4
A 530.83 we want it to be easy to find . ami_da_6
A 553.47 What else it what else do we want it to to do ? ami_da_4
A 553.47 So we want it to be universal . ami_da_4
A 572.5 It is something that we are supposed to sell for about twenty five Euros ami_da_4
A 572.5 and you know , ami_da_2
A 572.5 goals for profits are I think somewhere around fifty million Euros , what they want to make on it , so . ami_da_4
D 596.07 Also since we are partners of the International Remote Control Association , ami_da_4
D 596.07 maybe we want to make it something that would globally appeal . ami_da_6
A 604.37 Okay . ami_da_9
D 605.43 That is more on the research end , but the marketing . ami_da_4
A 609.92 So marketing , ami_da_3
A 609.92 you know , ami_da_2
A 609.92 how maybe ami_da_3
A 609.92 marketing , you could s find out what is the most universally appealing remote control out there . ami_da_6
D 625.67 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 627.66 And maybe as far as design goes , maybe we could have different ones for different target audiences , ami_da_6
D 627.66 because maybe one wo not apply to all of the countries we are targeting . ami_da_4
A 633.83 Okay . ami_da_1
C 634.46 Small . ami_da_16
A 650.33 Do you guys have any ideas for what it should look like ? ami_da_8
A 650.33 Maybe we could draw it up on the on the board over there . ami_da_6
A 670.44 Some ideas ? ami_da_8
A 670.44 We want it to be a b a ball , ami_da_6
A 670.44 you know , ami_da_2
A 670.44 we will draw up we will draw up the ball and maybe th where the buttons are located . ami_da_6
C 677.74 I would ami_da_3
C 677.74 I could draw sorta the ball idea . ami_da_7
C 689.07 My original idea was just simply sort of a sphere , ami_da_4
C 689.07 where maybe you ami_da_3
C 689.07 this is where it is connected together , and then when you open it out , it could fol it could be maybe flip , like a flip phone , ami_da_6
C 689.07 and then when you fold it out the middle ami_da_3
C 689.07 Maybe a hinge that will have to be the strongest part of it . ami_da_6
C 713.35 If that if we did use a hinge , or if it was just two parts , ami_da_3
C 713.35 and then you would have just sorta you you you know , your buttons . ami_da_6
C 722.69 Thing is inside ami_da_3
C 722.69 I think , sometimes remotes have too many buttons , ami_da_4
C 722.69 so maybe as simple as possible , as few buttons inside as possible . ami_da_6
C 732.99 , I dunno , what is the idea for . ami_da_9
C 736.12 Just something maybe if you ha ami_da_3
C 736.12 if it had like if some kind of like light or something or lights around it . ami_da_6
C 742.86 It is looking a bit like something out of Star Wars at the moment though , to be fair . ami_da_14
C 746.18 But yeah . ami_da_4
D 746.51 Futuristic . ami_da_9
C 748.76 That was that was a sorta simple idea I had ami_da_4
C 748.76 and then you know you could about ami_da_3
C 748.76 Right , ami_da_2
C 748.76 it would almost be like a ball . ami_da_4
A 750.15 Uh huh . ami_da_1
C 756.01 So that was just just an idea I had . ami_da_4
C 758.55 I do not know whether anybody else has other ideas ? ami_da_8
C 758.55 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 761.55 Right . ami_da_2
B 761.89 One problem you would get with this design is ami_da_3
B 761.89 the ball is a nice idea ami_da_9
B 761.89 because of it is stability really , but of course , since it is a ball , ami_da_4
B 761.89 it will roll , ami_da_9
B 761.89 so we would have to have it flat on one side at least , down here somewhere , take away that part . ami_da_6
C 770.95 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 772.76 Maybe f yeah . ami_da_9
B 776.46 That is one of the big issues . ami_da_4
C 778.62 Yeah , that is g that is a good idea . ami_da_9
B 778.81 Also also you risk the hinges here . ami_da_9
C 781.43 Yeah . ami_da_9
B 781.58 That is that is a problem . ami_da_9
C 782.42 The idea ami_da_3
C 782.42 it did not have to necessarily be f a hinge , ami_da_6
C 782.42 that was just one idea though . ami_da_4
B 785.31 That is that is interesting of course , but that is of course a weak point , yeah . ami_da_9
C 791.98 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 803.64 How would we go about making you know getting rid of our weak points ? ami_da_8
A 803.64 What ami_da_3
A 803.64 I mean would we just have a flat spot on the bottom of the ball ? ami_da_11
A 803.64 Not to put you on the spot , ami_da_14
A 803.64 but ami_da_3
A 803.64 What did you say your title was again ? ami_da_5
A 803.64 You are the the Industrial Designer . ami_da_12
B 818.26 E ami_da_3
B 818.26 No no , ami_da_14
B 823.08 N n ami_da_3
B 823.08 , I am your Industrial Designer , ami_da_4
B 823.08 so i b well , ami_da_2
B 823.08 the point is that ami_da_3
B 823.08 well ami_da_2
B 823.08 maybe I dunno . ami_da_4
B 842.67 The shape is perhaps not the most ideal . ami_da_9
A 845.28 Okay . ami_da_1
B 845.65 As as stable as it is , ami_da_9
B 845.65 there must be a compromise between stability and design here , so . ami_da_6
C 850.47 Well ami_da_2
C 850.47 I I suppose that things become design . ami_da_4
C 853.56 But I mean i ami_da_3
C 853.56 I was trying to think of like the design of others . ami_da_4
C 857.58 I ca not think of anything other than a long rectangle for remote , maybe small , sort of fatter ones , but there is nothing being done sort of out of left field , yeah . ami_da_4
A 862.99 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 865.98 It is not new , it is not innovative , ami_da_9
A 865.98 it is you know , ami_da_2
A 865.98 everybody does long remote because it is easy , it is it is stable . ami_da_4
C 870.25 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 876.06 Okay , ami_da_2
D 876.06 I will draw something . ami_da_7
A 877.3 So if ami_da_3
A 877.3 no , ami_da_4
A 877.3 go ahead . ami_da_6
D 878.34 What ? ami_da_5
D 878.34 My idea was just to have it be kind of like a keyboard type shape , you know , like video games ami_da_6
D 878.34 l so . ami_da_3
C 890.26 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 892.04 But maybe ami_da_3
D 892.04 I mean that would be kind of big and bulky . ami_da_9
D 894.82 We could also try to do the hinge thing , so it could like flip out that way . ami_da_6
D 900.42 I do not know . ami_da_9
D 903.41 That is my idea . ami_da_4
C 905.45 I think definitely doing something different is a good idea . ami_da_9
D 907.7 Yeah . ami_da_9
C 922.18 I mean maybe design something , ami_da_3
C 922.18 that is sort of like ami_da_3
C 922.18 suppose not everybody is everybody is hand is the same , ami_da_4
C 922.18 but something that would maybe fit in the hand easier . ami_da_6
A 933.48 Something with a grip . ami_da_6
C 934.55 Yeah , with a grip . ami_da_9
D 934.62 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 940.14 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 941.66 Because even I suppose even with the ball ami_da_9
A 941.66 it is ami_da_3
A 941.66 it might not be the easiest to hold onto . ami_da_9
C 944.44 It still might be hard to ami_da_3
C 944.44 it still not the ho easiest thing to hold , yeah . ami_da_9
A 951.7 So perhaps the the joystick the the keyboard idea might work better . ami_da_9
C 955.34 Like yeah . ami_da_1
A 959.62 But then again , people like to use one hand to flip and one hand to hold their soda , ami_da_4
A 959.62 so maybe maybe we ami_da_3
A 959.62 I feel like I am just shooting everything down here . ami_da_15
C 964.79 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 965.44 True . ami_da_9
C 967.01 It is d ami_da_3
C 967.01 yeah . ami_da_2
C 967.34 I think it is definitely got to be a a one handed a one handed job . ami_da_6
A 976.7 Yeah . ami_da_4
D 977.19 That is fine . ami_da_14
D 978.61 You are the boss , ami_da_4
D 978.61 you are allowed to . ami_da_14
B 982.89 Well ami_da_2
B 982.89 with the one handed design you also have the the problem of the size ami_da_9
B 982.89 w ami_da_3
B 982.89 because you know from cell phones , they can be too small . ami_da_4
B 989.85 So if the remote is too small it ami_da_3
B 989.85 if it is small it probably looks better , but may not be th as functional . ami_da_9
D 989.92 Yeah . ami_da_9
B 999.56 So for that there is So ami_da_3
B 999.56 The question is also , I dunno , d do you really always want to open that thing when you have to use it ? ami_da_9
B 999.56 It is probably going to lie around opened all the time anyway , ami_da_4
B 999.56 so I do not know if a lid is a good idea . ami_da_9
A 1003.23 Okay , so ami_da_2
A 1003.23 unfortunately we have got about five minutes here to come up with our remote control idea and start rolling with it . ami_da_6
A 1016.5 we have talked about our experiences with remote control and we have got a couple ideas . ami_da_4
A 1030.55 Let is see here . ami_da_16
A 1040.52 What if we had what if we had not only ami_da_3
A 1040.52 say we went with the ball the ball function , but maybe we give it sort of grips along the side s ami_da_6
A 1040.52 to make it easier to hold on to . ami_da_9
A 1063.72 So you know s ami_da_2
A 1063.72 so ami_da_2
A 1063.72 it is easier to hold onto that way . ami_da_9
C 1071.81 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 1074.04 Course that will then remove some of our our ball . ami_da_4
A 1077.41 Unless this unless this part were raised , ami_da_4
A 1077.41 so ami_da_2
A 1077.41 say the cover flips over and covers that part . ami_da_6
A 1086.48 So the grip is ami_da_3
A 1086.48 No , that would not work either . ami_da_9
A 1096.72 But if we are going to make it flat on the bottom , then that eliminates our ball anyways . ami_da_4
A 1102.02 So if it were flat on the bottom and then had the sorta grips on the side here I guess , ami_da_6
A 1102.02 and then flat ami_da_3
A 1102.02 And then we have the problem with the hinge . ami_da_9
A 1128.29 So if we are flat on the bottom , it is not going to roll away , it will stay where we want . ami_da_4
A 1138.79 , that is true . ami_da_9
B 1146.26 From stabil stability point of view it certainly is , ami_da_9
B 1146.26 but also you have to face it and take into account the more of these things break by accident , the more we sell . ami_da_4
B 1161.35 So ami_da_2
B 1161.35 it is ami_da_3
B 1161.35 do not make it too stable . ami_da_6
A 1163.72 So ami_da_2
A 1163.72 we do not have it flip open . ami_da_6
A 1167.09 We just have a ball ami_da_6
A 1167.09 Okay , ami_da_2
A 1167.09 so then we forget the ball . ami_da_6
C 1170.12 But then maybe to go back to the to th s something along those things then . ami_da_6
B 1173.79 To the other design . ami_da_6
B 1179.37 It looks cool . ami_da_9
D 1179.56 Looks cool though . ami_da_9
A 1180.95 It looks cool , but it is really not it is not functional . ami_da_9
D 1181.55 Yeah . ami_da_9
B 1183.4 functional . ami_da_4
A 1186.28 So we have got our sort of keyboard kind . ami_da_4
A 1189.35 What if we flipped it around here , ami_da_6
A 1189.35 so that it were ami_da_3
A 1189.35 Sorry , ami_da_14
A 1189.35 that does not look anything like what you had there . ami_da_4
A 1200.8 so ami_da_2
A 1200.8 it is up and down , you hold it this way . ami_da_4
A 1205.65 Course then it is it is like the rectangular again , only with a couple of jutting out points . ami_da_4
C 1205.65 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 1210.15 Right . ami_da_12
B 1211.54 Right . ami_da_12
A 1212.19 But it is one handed . ami_da_4
B 1216.1 Question is what makes those game pads functional ? ami_da_5
B 1216.1 W ami_da_3
B 1216.1 I think that is pretty much the form for full hand . ami_da_4
B 1222.88 So it is a round shape underneath that makes it comfy , ami_da_4
B 1222.88 right , ami_da_2
B 1222.88 makes it nice , ami_da_4
B 1222.88 so that is the essential part . ami_da_9
A 1226.7 Yeah . ami_da_9
B 1229.66 Except for that I think we will not probably not get a get away from some longer design . ami_da_4
A 1230.92 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 1235.36 Right . ami_da_1
B 1237.3 Because you also have to know which way around to point this thing . ami_da_4
A 1243.07 Yeah , ami_da_9
A 1243.07 because it does not have a cord , like joysticks do . ami_da_4
B 1243.14 You know , all ami_da_2
B 1243.14 that dif batteries ami_da_3
B 1243.14 right , ami_da_9
B 1243.14 and Batteries go weak as well , ami_da_4
B 1243.14 so ami_da_2
B 1243.14 after a while you have to point it towards the towards the equipment you want to control with it , ami_da_4
B 1243.14 right ? ami_da_13
B 1243.14 So , have to m show which is the front , which is the back . ami_da_6
A 1261.8 Is it possible to have it to where it would work with a like a sensor on either side ? ami_da_11
A 1261.8 So that either way you are pointing it it would work . ami_da_4
B 1268.36 I suppose you could do that . ami_da_9
B 1269.91 O of course the more technology you stick in that , the more it will cost , so . ami_da_9
A 1273.43 More expensive and yeah . ami_da_12
B 1275.85 Course you can do that . ami_da_9
A 1278.86 Okay . ami_da_12
A 1281.27 True . ami_da_9
B 1286.36 I mean of course it will be evident after a while or ami_da_3
B 1286.36 if you look at it , it will it will be evident which way around to point it , since you have the the numbers and the and the the buttons and stuff , but it is rather about an instinctual thing , like you just grab it ami_da_4
B 1286.36 , you do not have to s look at it , ami_da_4
B 1286.36 you know , ami_da_2
B 1286.36 which way around to point it . ami_da_4
C 1297.74 Put it ami_da_3
C 1297.74 Even if you designed it in some in a way that you know , is not a rectangle , but still pointed in a direction that had definite points . ami_da_6
B 1302.92 Otherwise the design of or the the point of putting two sensors on both sides would probably work . ami_da_9
C 1318.76 So if that is your thing and you got something like that instead , ami_da_4
C 1318.76 and there is your s ami_da_3
C 1318.76 you kn ami_da_3
C 1318.76 you know which way you are going to pointing it . ami_da_4
D 1321.05 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 1325.73 Okay . ami_da_12
D 1326.29 Sorry to interrupt , ami_da_14
D 1326.29 but we have a warning to finish . ami_da_4
C 1326.4 Does it say what does it say for n ami_da_3
C 1326.4 it says on there what we need to do for the next meeting , I think . ami_da_4
A 1327.88 Are we out of time ? ami_da_5
A 1327.88 Okay , well , ami_da_2
A 1327.88 just to finish up , ami_da_6
A 1327.88 should we s go with this plan , ami_da_11
A 1327.88 start making some Are good ideas , what are not . ami_da_3
D 1328.64 Yeah . ami_da_4
B 1351.04 Let is . ami_da_9
B 1351.66 Obviously ami_da_3
A 1357.77 Must finish now , so . ami_da_6
A 1360.86 And then marketing will look and see what what people want . ami_da_4
A 1369.66 Okay . ami_da_2
A 1370.94 And Project Manager will design a better meeting for next time around , ami_da_14
A 1370.94 be a little bit more prepared . ami_da_7
A 1378.58 And alright , ami_da_2
