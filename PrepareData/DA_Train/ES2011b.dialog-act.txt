D 31.54 Okay . ami_da_9
A 33.49 Okay so we will try to zip through this , since we are short on time . ami_da_6
A 36.52 Welcome everybody . ami_da_14
A 37.97 hope your sessions went well . ami_da_14
A 41.52 so this is our functional design meeting , we are going to consider user needs , technical effects , and the working design of our remote control . ami_da_4
A 56.89 I have been taking meetings on the minute minutes on the meetings , ami_da_4
A 56.89 and I will be putting them in the shared documents folder ami_da_7
A 56.89 so if there is anything you need to refer to you can find them in there . ami_da_4
A 67.24 I I will get the ones up for next time , ami_da_7
A 67.24 they are not finished yet . ami_da_4
A 72.84 Right . ami_da_2
A 73.18 so can we have updates from everyone from what you have worked ami_da_6
A 73.18 on just kind of a quick summary of anything interesting that you would like to share or discuss in this ami_da_4
A 73.18 sure . ami_da_9
D 83.19 And I can start if you want . ami_da_7
D 86.24 Is there an order ? ami_da_5
D 86.24 No . ami_da_5
D 88.05 We have not decided on an order . ami_da_5
A 88.39 Hm ? ami_da_12
A 88.39 No , any any order is fine . ami_da_4
D 90.38 First . ami_da_1
D 91.73 Okay . ami_da_9
A 92.04 Yeah . ami_da_4
D 92.74 , how do I put this ami_da_5
D 92.74 I will just put the cable in . ami_da_7
B 95.3 Just You may need to ami_da_3
B 95.3 But sometimes you have to do it ami_da_2
B 95.3 it is like a three set setting cycle , so press it a couple times , hold down function and then press F eight . ami_da_4
A 98.48 Oh yeah , ami_da_9
A 98.48 sorry . ami_da_14
D 107.96 Is that it ? ami_da_5
D 107.96 Can you see ? ami_da_5
D 107.96 Oh , here . ami_da_9
D 109.47 Okay . ami_da_9
D 113.96 So what happens it does not work ? ami_da_5
D 113.96 No . ami_da_9
A 115.32 It sh it takes a few seconds I think . ami_da_4
C 131.67 Who is that ? ami_da_5
D 135.39 Is it in the right thing ? ami_da_5
D 135.39 Oh wait , . ami_da_16
D 146.73 You need to help me . ami_da_6
A 148.19 Uh huh , and then press function . ami_da_4
D 152.15 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 152.37 and F eight . ami_da_4
C 157.0 Could you just plug it back into hers ami_da_6
C 157.0 because she had oh . ami_da_3
D 158.5 Oh , wait . ami_da_16
D 159.42 That is ami_da_2
D 159.42 is that it ? ami_da_5
D 159.42 Right here we are . ami_da_9
B 160.55 Adjusting . ami_da_3
A 162.66 Here we are . ami_da_16
B 165.76 The cable might be a little loose or something . ami_da_4
B 167.99 Oh , you got it . ami_da_9
A 169.12 Oh . ami_da_5
A 169.37 Is it on ? ami_da_5
A 169.37 Okay . ami_da_9
D 169.75 We are here . ami_da_4
D 170.59 Okay , . ami_da_2
D 172.05 In order to see what the functional requirements were to be found , a hundred people were tested in a usability laboratory ami_da_4
D 172.05 through just their habits to n know ami_da_2
D 172.05 their habits were observed and questionnaires were given out . ami_da_4
D 190.71 , the findings in in some cases matched what we were talking about . ami_da_4
D 197.3 Custome Customers and users do not like the way remote controls look , they do not like the way they feel ami_da_4
D 197.3 , they do not think they match their operating behaviour , and an example is what we were talking about , the buttons , they only use ten per cent of the buttons , so later on there is a study of the buttons that they use most ami_da_4
D 197.3 and I think we should design according to these buttons . ami_da_6
D 220.02 Easy to lose , and RSI . ami_da_4
D 221.8 I do not know what RSI means . ami_da_4
D 223.88 the person that did the questionnaire obviously did , I do not have a clue . ami_da_4
A 227.72 Hm . ami_da_1
D 228.74 , according to the frequency of use and the relevance of each buttons , I have made a list of the buttons that we should focus on in order of importance . ami_da_4
D 241.23 So the most important buttons are those to do with channel selection . ami_da_4
D 244.83 They are used about a hundred and sixty times per hour . ami_da_4
D 249.16 And ami_da_2
D 249.16 yeah ami_da_4
D 249.16 so ami_da_4
D 249.16 and and people like to zap a lot apparently , ami_da_4
D 249.16 so this is the order . ami_da_4
D 256.12 Channel selection , teletext , volume , and power . ami_da_4
D 260.1 The other ones are the settings , and they are used less than you know zero point eight to zero point five times per hour , and this means that I think we can we could have like a a button for all the settings , and then , just one , and then from there go on to the audio on the screen , either on the remote or on the television . ami_da_4
D 278.72 about the screen , and speech recognition , some people are more willing than others to actually pay for that . ami_da_4
D 286.48 And if we look at the market , f people from well from fifteen to thirty five year old year olds , I do not really know how to describe this , ninety one to seventy six percent of people in that age range are willing to pay more for this sort of product , while people that are above thirty five years ol years old go from thirty five percent to eight percent , so people that are sixty five for example would not actually pay for this sort of thing . ami_da_4
D 317.15 I do not I do not know what the decision to be made is , ami_da_9
D 317.15 but I think that the people that actually do buy remotes m more are those like teenagers and young professionals and , most likely , ami_da_4
D 317.15 but we should discuss this together . ami_da_6
D 334.8 And that is all I have to say about the matter , . ami_da_4
A 337.77 Okay . ami_da_1
D 341.89 Shall I ami_da_2
D 341.89 what do I do ? ami_da_5
D 341.89 Do I give this to someone else ? ami_da_5
D 341.89 Function F eight . ami_da_4
A 344.4 Yeah . ami_da_4
A 345.0 Just move right on . ami_da_4
C 350.17 Right . ami_da_9
C 352.15 So get this . ami_da_16
C 377.81 Okay so now I need to press F eight , what is it ? ami_da_5
C 377.81 Okay . ami_da_9
A 382.08 function F eight . ami_da_4
C 390.16 What is function ? ami_da_5
C 390.16 Oh function , I see it . ami_da_9
A 391.49 It is the little blue w it is the one th ami_da_4
A 391.49 yeah . ami_da_9
C 397.68 There we go . ami_da_16
A 398.05 Yeah should be ami_da_3
A 398.05 It should be yeah . ami_da_4
C 410.55 Okay . ami_da_2
C 414.07 This my presentation about the technical functions design and I basically just tried to focus on just what what functions we need and how to make that the best function for the user . ami_da_4
C 430.95 So and I just sort of like thought about it myself and looked on the internet . ami_da_4
C 435.42 And okay so basically I think i like it is really important that we sort of get this done in a user friendly and fashionable way . ami_da_4
C 445.32 so I think things like you know keeping buttons together that like close together that are used in the same way , or maybe that making them the same colour , keeping the number of buttons the leas you know to a minimum , ami_da_6
C 445.32 and also things like is it is ami_da_4
C 445.32 it is it ami_da_4
C 445.32 can you c ami_da_4
C 445.32 y small enough large enough ami_da_4
C 445.32 I am not sure ami_da_9
C 445.32 we c ami_da_9
C 445.32 I guess we would need to do some research about , I would , about what size is appropriate and that sort of thing , ami_da_6
C 445.32 but basically we need to make sure that it turns on and off the TV . ami_da_4
C 487.59 Does it have like capacity to change the channels ? ami_da_4
C 487.59 does it do ami_da_2
C 487.59 or do we need to have like functions for cable or VCR ? ami_da_4
C 487.59 And then , is it findable , and how do we want to do that ? ami_da_4
C 487.59 And ami_da_2
C 487.59 I just thought that these two remotes were pretty boring , ami_da_9
C 487.59 I dunno if this will work but ami_da_4
C 487.59 And I think we can find something that is more fun to look at and use than either of those . ami_da_9
C 521.54 Just I mean I like the one on the right better , just because it does have fewer buttons , ami_da_9
C 521.54 but I mean I think we sh can sort of think about things like like colour ami_da_6
C 521.54 and you know size , shapes , that sort of thing , to best fit the user . ami_da_6
C 540.91 That concludes my presentation . ami_da_4
C 545.86 Okay . ami_da_4
C 546.3 You need the little thingy . ami_da_4
C 564.54 Ooh . ami_da_16
B 593.58 How do I ami_da_16
B 593.58 Right . ami_da_9
D 599.83 S ami_da_3
D 599.83 That is on view . ami_da_4
D 611.11 Oh . ami_da_16
B 614.36 Okay so this is on the working design , which is sort of the mechanical functions of the remote , and the method I used was to basically look at existing designs and incorporate ideas from our last meeting . ami_da_4
B 628.1 so I think we need two basic functions which is just the basic remote functions , the user can input a channel or volume setting and it will be output to the TV . ami_da_4
B 638.81 And also we talked about a location function where maybe you could press a button on the TV and it would send sort of signal to the remote where it would beep or flash or vibrate or whatever to tell you where the remote is . ami_da_4
B 652.0 So the components we need are an energy source to power the remote , input which would probably be buttons , although we just talked about voice recognition , processor to take the information , something to transmit it to the TV , and we also need something on the remote that would receive the location signal and have an output , like possibly a beep or a vibration . ami_da_4
B 675.74 And also you need a sender for location signal , which would probably be a separate thing that we would have to sell with the remote and people could stick it on their TV or stick it on their wall . ami_da_4
B 686.77 And this is just sort of an overview of how the remote works . ami_da_4
B 690.35 Power comes from the battery , goes to the chip , and then it is sent from there to an infrared bulb which is probably the easiest way to send to the TV . ami_da_4
B 700.59 And then for the location function , you would have a sender on the TV which would output some sort of signal , we could use IR but we would probably want to use radio instead . ami_da_4
B 711.32 That signal would go to a receiver which it would process it , and it would be output in the form of a buzzer or a light lighting up . ami_da_4
B 721.77 so my personal preferences for how to build the remote would probably be , battery for the energy source , ami_da_6
B 721.77 that way you would not have to plug it in , ami_da_4
B 721.77 a button pad for input , ami_da_6
B 721.77 we can purchase a pre made chip which will handle all the processing stuff , ami_da_4
B 721.77 IR transmitter to communicate to the TV , ami_da_6
B 721.77 that is just sort of standard , so most TVs have an IR receiver . ami_da_4
B 743.2 Probably a radio receiver to send out location function and to receive it and I would probably say a buzzer for the location function on the remote itself . ami_da_6
B 752.83 So that concludes my presentation . ami_da_4
A 756.06 Okay . ami_da_1
C 756.34 Do you know about like ami_da_5
C 756.34 I dunno , you seem like you know about ami_da_4
C 756.34 Okay . ami_da_9
B 758.19 Yeah , I d I was an engineer before I came here . ami_da_4
C 763.16 Cool . ami_da_9
A 768.96 Okay . ami_da_2
A 769.51 Well thank you everybody . ami_da_14
A 770.82 we have ami_da_2
A 770.82 we will discuss that ami_da_6
A 770.82 and then I just want to mention some new project requirements that came in . ami_da_7
A 779.86 , teletext is apparently outdated , so due to internet popularity , so that is off the list . ami_da_4
A 790.64 , also our remote should be used only for television , , no extra internet kind of fancy things , just the remote and the television . ami_da_4
A 803.07 and also we need to incorporate our corporate image onto this , ami_da_4
A 803.07 so the phrase is , we put fashion in electronics , ami_da_4
A 803.07 so let is be fashionable I guess . ami_da_6
A 820.66 if we have something ami_da_2
A 820.66 I mean silver and and gold or yellow are our colours , ami_da_4
A 820.66 so if we had a like a kind of silver one like you saw , and yellow writing , something like that . ami_da_6
A 834.81 Okay . ami_da_2
A 837.64 So we need to make some decisions on the remote control functions . ami_da_6
A 843.42 , yeah . ami_da_2
A 848.99 Do Let is ami_da_2
A 848.99 I guess we should yeah make some kind of brainstorming , ami_da_6
A 848.99 see what we can ami_da_3
A 848.99 wha what ami_da_2
A 848.99 well probably our target group and how it is going to going to appeal to our target group ami_da_4
A 848.99 and I dunno the the s ami_da_2
A 848.99 the buttons and what it does and that sort of thing . ami_da_4
C 855.35 Like in terms of how it looks , or like what it does ? ami_da_5
C 855.35 Okay . ami_da_1
D 856.87 How it looks or the the buzzer you mean , ami_da_5
D 856.87 yeah , for sure , yeah . ami_da_9
C 872.34 Yeah . ami_da_9
C 873.74 Okay . ami_da_9
A 873.91 So . ami_da_4
C 877.54 So ami_da_2
C 877.54 Is our target group then people ami_da_3
C 877.54 so do we want to go ahead and design this thing with the finder button ? ami_da_11
C 877.54 So ami_da_2
C 877.54 Okay . ami_da_9
A 888.49 I think that seems to ami_da_9
A 888.49 yeah . ami_da_9
B 888.87 It is easy to implement . ami_da_9
C 891.01 So the ami_da_3
C 891.01 yeah , ami_da_4
C 891.01 yeah , ami_da_4
C 891.01 yeah . ami_da_4
B 893.58 Locator . ami_da_4
C 894.27 So then our target age group would be the nineteen to thirty five range , ami_da_4
C 894.27 what was it ? ami_da_5
C 894.27 Oh . ami_da_12
A 898.52 Yeah , teenagers and young professionals . ami_da_4
D 900.32 Well that is for speech recognition . ami_da_4
B 902.79 Well ami_da_3
B 902.79 I was thinking about that ami_da_4
B 902.79 but I mean speech recognition is really hard to programme , and also , if the TV is on it is making sound and the people on the TV are talking , and if somebody says like one , then the TV is going to switch itself to channel one , ami_da_4
B 902.79 or it seems like a silly , ami_da_3
B 902.79 I am not sure how you would implement it . ami_da_9
A 902.96 Oh , . ami_da_12
D 903.01 And screen . ami_da_4
D 904.39 That is only for speech recognition and screen . ami_da_4
A 910.02 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 916.69 Yeah ami_da_9
D 916.69 yeah ami_da_9
D 916.69 yeah . ami_da_9
C 917.39 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 917.85 I mean ami_da_3
D 917.85 I just put the values in . ami_da_4
C 918.73 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 922.79 And if if you consider our budget , it probably ami_da_2
A 922.79 if you consider our budget , to h have speech recognition programmed in every single remote might be a little pricey . ami_da_9
D 922.84 But the screen is the same as what , ami_da_3
D 922.84 Yeah , I am happy with that . ami_da_9
B 924.81 It is a cool idea but ami_da_9
B 924.81 Well you would have to have a button on a TV or on your wall or some place since the TV already has power . ami_da_4
C 927.25 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 933.81 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 934.49 Completely . ami_da_9
C 934.61 Hu ami_da_1
C 934.61 yeah . ami_da_1
A 935.0 Right ami_da_2
A 935.0 so ami_da_2
A 935.0 yeah . ami_da_2
C 939.16 Okay so are we going to have just some kind of a like we will have the buzzer on the som like on the TV itself . ami_da_11
D 946.21 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 947.81 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 949.62 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 950.47 Yeah you click the button , it is going to send out a signal , and I was thinking , IR is line of sight , so unless the remote is like actually in front of the TV it is not going to work , so probably like a radio signal like on a on a cell phone . ami_da_4
C 961.55 Okay . ami_da_1
C 962.24 Okay . ami_da_1
D 962.25 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 963.06 Okay . ami_da_1
C 963.08 Alright . ami_da_1
A 963.25 Okay . ami_da_1
B 963.26 Sends out a signal and then the the remote hears the signal and so it beeps probably . ami_da_4
C 968.71 Okay . ami_da_9
A 969.1 So you you would need like a separate base for that or like something ami_da_5
A 969.1 you can ami_da_5
A 969.1 right . ami_da_1
B 972.15 It would have to be sold separately because if the sender is on the remote then you would have to find the remote first to click the button to find the remote . ami_da_4
A 977.26 Yeah , ami_da_1
A 977.26 yeah . ami_da_1
D 979.72 So do you plug it in the T ami_da_5
D 979.72 you plug it in TV , this thing ? ami_da_5
D 979.72 Okay . ami_da_1
B 982.93 Yeah , it would probably just stick it on your TV so if you need to find the remote , click the button . ami_da_4
D 985.73 Okay . ami_da_1
C 986.4 So it is now like a two part thing . ami_da_5
B 988.0 Yeah , so it would be a two part package . ami_da_4
C 988.63 Okay . ami_da_9
C 989.66 Alright . ami_da_9
D 989.88 Okay . ami_da_1
C 991.14 So we get to design that too . ami_da_4
C 993.36 Make it fashionable . ami_da_4
C 995.94 , okay . ami_da_2
A 998.61 So do you think even though we are not talking about speek speech recognition our target group should still be teenagers and young professionals . ami_da_11
B 1004.91 Yeah I think so . ami_da_9
D 1005.4 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 1005.95 Huh . ami_da_1
D 1006.62 Just there . ami_da_9
A 1007.72 Okay . ami_da_9
D 1008.69 Are we should that thing be on the thing to put the you s ami_da_2
D 1008.69 you talking about a home for it . ami_da_4
D 1016.67 Do you still want to build a little thing next to the telly or to p hang on the wall or shall we leave that for now ? ami_da_11
D 1016.67 Okay . ami_da_1
A 1016.79 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 1022.64 We probably leave that . ami_da_9
A 1023.52 I mean I guess one takes care of the other , ami_da_9
A 1023.52 like if you can ami_da_4
A 1023.52 yeah ami_da_4
A 1023.52 if you can call it then it is ami_da_4
A 1023.52 Yeah . ami_da_9
C 1026.28 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 1030.9 Then it can live anywhere . ami_da_4
D 1032.69 Okay . ami_da_2
C 1032.93 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 1033.56 For the ami_da_2
D 1033.56 so you have that button , ami_da_4
D 1033.56 that so there is ami_da_2
D 1033.56 is there a light or shall we leave just have a radio ? ami_da_11
D 1033.56 Are we just having a radio ? ami_da_5
D 1033.56 On the phone . ami_da_4
B 1041.85 on the TV or on the phone ? ami_da_5
B 1041.85 it seemed like a a beep seemed the most reasonable to me , ami_da_9
B 1041.85 I think that is what the phone has , I mean when you need to find your phone , you just have someone call it ami_da_4
B 1041.85 and it starts ringing somewhere ami_da_4
B 1041.85 and then you can figure out that it is in the couch or wherever . ami_da_4
C 1045.47 T ami_da_3
C 1045.47 So i ami_da_1
C 1045.47 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 1046.31 You do not need a light . ami_da_9
D 1047.81 Yeah ami_da_9
D 1047.81 yeah ami_da_9
D 1047.81 yeah . ami_da_9
A 1048.58 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 1049.36 Yeah yeah . ami_da_9
A 1050.34 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 1054.79 And like if the if the phone is under the couch , you might not see the light , so ami_da_4
A 1054.79 yeah . ami_da_9
D 1057.2 You can hear it is under the couch ami_da_4
D 1057.2 yeah . ami_da_4
D 1059.9 So need the other buttons . ami_da_4
D 1069.35 So we have this . ami_da_4
A 1071.48 So I mean the two remotes that you had shown r ami_da_4
A 1071.48 I do not remember who showed them , ami_da_4
A 1071.48 yeah ami_da_9
A 1071.48 you you did , ami_da_9
A 1071.48 they are ami_da_2
A 1071.48 I mean one looked like it was for VCR type thing , and the other looked like just television . ami_da_4
C 1075.7 That was that was me . ami_da_4
C 1084.07 I think w I think they are both sort of just like general remo they are both general remotes . ami_da_4
A 1087.64 Oh really . ami_da_9
C 1089.34 And ami_da_3
C 1089.34 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 1089.41 Because that that is something we have to decide , is whether we want to have VCR capabilities . ami_da_6
B 1095.43 Does anyone know if VCRs are the same across international ? ami_da_5
B 1095.43 Okay , so you would need like a whole different set of buttons for everybody is VCRs . ami_da_9
A 1099.99 They are not no . ami_da_4
D 1100.57 They are not , no . ami_da_4
C 1101.79 S ami_da_3
C 1101.79 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 1102.98 Yeah , that is right , yeah . ami_da_9
D 1103.6 It not VHS here ? ami_da_5
D 1103.6 But VCRs ami_da_3
D 1103.6 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 1104.62 But DVD probably is . ami_da_4
B 1107.46 Yeah , other than that region and coding thing . ami_da_9
A 1110.69 And and if we are if we are targeting young professionals and teenagers , I mean it is going to be DVD type , that is the the technology these days . ami_da_9
D 1116.91 Yeah , for sure . ami_da_9
C 1118.86 So . ami_da_2
C 1119.87 Okay , ami_da_2
C 1119.87 let is see if I can ami_da_16
C 1119.87 I think still though , it should not be that hard to take like just reduce the number of buttons you know , ami_da_9
C 1119.87 like because if you just have like one menu button , that works like with a you know , or you can just kind of scroll through the options u that come up on the TV . ami_da_4
A 1127.64 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 1136.63 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 1137.78 Well for sure we need the ami_da_3
D 1137.78 I think we can just design the channels ? ami_da_6
D 1137.78 I mean power is just a button , and it is not used that much , s ami_da_4
D 1137.78 and it is usually that red ami_da_4
D 1137.78 and I think it is quite nice to keep it like red . ami_da_9
A 1146.51 S ami_da_3
A 1146.51 Huh . ami_da_1
C 1147.54 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 1150.07 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 1151.66 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 1154.12 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 1154.98 You know , I have seen some remotes that where you just hold one , like if you hold one down ami_da_4
A 1154.98 it is it is a different colour than the other buttons ami_da_4
A 1154.98 but that turns it on . ami_da_4
A 1164.18 So you do not actually have a separate power button , it is just ami_da_4
A 1164.18 But ami_da_3
A 1164.18 It might be confusing . ami_da_9
D 1166.52 Oh okay , yeah . ami_da_9
C 1167.72 It seems like that would be hard though . ami_da_9
C 1169.07 I mean , like because unless you know ami_da_2
C 1169.07 yeah . ami_da_9
A 1172.96 Yeah . ami_da_9
C 1173.65 Just because I would not ami_da_2
C 1173.65 I would probably pick it up and just be like why is there no on button . ami_da_9
A 1175.44 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 1177.27 Besides you like to be able to go power . ami_da_9
B 1178.12 Yeah , I never think to hold something down . ami_da_9
D 1178.41 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 1179.26 I have the power ami_da_14
A 1179.26 I guess . ami_da_9
C 1179.4 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 1179.97 B ami_da_1
C 1179.97 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 1182.95 So we definitely want a power button and numbers . ami_da_9
C 1185.97 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 1186.23 Right . ami_da_9
D 1186.48 Well even iPod thing , ami_da_6
D 1186.48 like , ami_da_2
D 1186.48 I do not know ami_da_11
D 1186.48 if people like this ami_da_11
D 1186.48 but if you want to reduce the number , of buttons , instead of having like one to nine , have a sort of scrolling ami_da_6
D 1186.48 I do not know . ami_da_4
C 1202.05 That sort of like joystick flat touch thing , yeah . ami_da_6
D 1204.16 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 1205.36 Because people li seem ami_da_2
D 1205.36 now the iPod is out people seem to like this thing that there is no Know ami_da_4
D 1205.36 you do not have one two three four five ami_da_4
D 1205.36 Yeah ami_da_9
D 1205.36 yeah , it is just and it is one thing which has everything . ami_da_9
C 1212.93 Yeah , ami_da_9
C 1212.93 yeah . ami_da_9
C 1213.48 I think that is an interesting idea , because it is cool , ami_da_9
C 1213.48 it is it is funny like you ami_da_2
C 1213.48 f like I just ami_da_2
C 1213.48 I do not have an iPod ami_da_4
C 1213.48 but like I , you know , I just like started messing around with one of my friend is the other day , ami_da_4
C 1213.48 and you just sort of ami_da_2
C 1213.48 and ami_da_2
C 1213.48 it is funny how you pick it up ami_da_4
C 1213.48 and you just figure out how to use it quite easily , ami_da_4
C 1213.48 like it is not that hard , you know . ami_da_4
A 1227.65 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 1229.73 Yeah , and it is ami_da_9
C 1229.73 yeah . ami_da_9
C 1231.77 It is really ami_da_3
C 1231.77 but do you need a screen then , do you have to have a screen then ? ami_da_5
C 1231.77 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 1234.82 Well ca not it tell the like ca not you if you ami_da_2
D 1234.82 you can have the number on the telly going like one two three four five once you scroll and then ami_da_6
D 1234.82 It is like l this like that , and then you do that . ami_da_4
B 1237.83 Yeah , you can have the number going around in the corner . ami_da_6
C 1239.87 Okay . ami_da_1
C 1240.6 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 1241.72 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 1242.82 Okay so we have this like scrolling sort of button . ami_da_9
A 1243.36 Oh that is going to ami_da_3
A 1243.36 Is that like on on a mouse pad where like kind of ami_da_5
A 1243.36 okay . ami_da_9
C 1246.34 Like a disc . ami_da_4
C 1248.29 Yeah . ami_da_4
C 1248.97 Yeah . ami_da_4
C 1249.21 It is like it is just like the same technology as a mouse pad . ami_da_4
A 1250.88 I have never used one . ami_da_4
A 1252.05 No . ami_da_4
A 1253.67 Okay . ami_da_1
A 1255.35 Okay . ami_da_1
C 1255.35 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 1256.87 Yeah and then . ami_da_3
D 1256.92 And then you can have ami_da_2
D 1256.92 if you actually just want to zap , you can have like a thing like that , and that , and then it can just be plus and minus . ami_da_6
C 1271.47 Okay . ami_da_9
C 1272.5 So like it is like a little part of the circle that ami_da_9
C 1272.5 Or it ami_da_2
C 1272.5 oh so it is just a region of the circle that you can zap . ami_da_9
D 1277.25 Yeah , ami_da_9
D 1277.25 you can ami_da_3
D 1277.25 Yeah , click o actually click on to have ami_da_4
D 1277.25 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 1278.16 Well i ami_da_3
A 1278.16 We could we could even have four buttons , like , if that is the if that is the mouse , you could have the volume and the channel changers just like on that as well . ami_da_6
C 1281.51 Okay . ami_da_9
C 1290.74 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 1291.52 So volume could be like the top it and the bottom ami_da_6
C 1291.52 So do you need to ami_da_3
C 1291.52 okay . ami_da_9
B 1294.88 Does not it rotate though , ami_da_5
B 1294.88 so it will be moving around . ami_da_4
C 1296.77 Well y you have to you have to like be able to change the function of it to like ami_da_4
C 1296.77 I mean like okay , because so I dunno , I guess ami_da_2
C 1296.77 Okay ami_da_2
C 1296.77 so when you g scroll your thumb like around it , it will s like say you are go ami_da_4
C 1296.77 you are going clockwise . ami_da_4
D 1301.76 What do you mean the function ? ami_da_5
D 1301.76 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 1313.18 That that means you are going to go up the channels , and then you scroll the other way and it will go down . ami_da_4
D 1317.14 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 1317.5 But then ami_da_2
C 1317.5 so if you want to switch to the to u do you have to switch to a function where like y ami_da_4
C 1317.5 so you are either in that mode ami_da_4
C 1317.5 or you are in the mode ami_da_4
C 1317.5 where like it just has like the four like you know ami_da_4
C 1317.5 this is channel that way ami_da_4
C 1317.5 , that is that way and volume is up and down . ami_da_4
D 1331.62 Yeah but it knows for some reason . ami_da_4
C 1332.88 It just ami_da_3
C 1332.88 It just kno the iPod knows . ami_da_9
D 1333.75 The iPod knows . ami_da_4
C 1336.03 S ami_da_9
C 1336.03 Yeah . ami_da_9
B 1336.24 If it works on an iPod then it works . ami_da_9
A 1338.22 Huh . ami_da_1
C 1338.35 So you just you just can either do this or like you can just touch it if you want . ami_da_5
B 1339.42 I do not have one . ami_da_4
D 1341.76 Well for the volume you have to press the middle , and then go up . ami_da_4
C 1344.36 Okay . ami_da_9
C 1344.74 That is what I mean . ami_da_9
C 1345.48 Okay . ami_da_9
C 1346.84 Okay so you have to like press this middle region ami_da_5
C 1346.84 and then you can scroll up , go up and down . ami_da_5
B 1348.05 Oh . ami_da_16
D 1351.09 And then well if you do that it goes , ami_da_4
D 1351.09 but if you like that makes more sense ami_da_9
D 1351.09 because there is already ones with up and down here , that I have seen . ami_da_4
A 1351.36 So it is like holding ami_da_3
A 1351.36 You can o ami_da_3
A 1351.36 And you you ami_da_3
A 1351.36 is there an extra actual button ? ami_da_5
A 1351.36 Or are you actually you are just using the mouse to go up and down . ami_da_5
D 1366.29 Well what you for the iPod you press an ami_da_2
D 1366.29 w right ami_da_4
D 1366.29 if you are on the channel let is say , then you press on the middle and then if you do that again the volume goes up , and if you do that it goes down . ami_da_4
A 1366.82 Like ami_da_3
C 1367.24 It is like a b Like ami_da_3
C 1367.24 I think we can go on the fact that it does just work with the iPod . ami_da_9
A 1374.57 Right . ami_da_1
D 1376.15 But if you want to keep it with volume here and here , I am pretty sure ami_da_3
D 1376.15 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 1382.16 Well I mean if if you are going to this for channels , right , then y would not the volume need to be separate somehow ? ami_da_5
A 1382.16 Like you could just have Oh , like Oh ami_da_3
A 1382.16 you could actually ami_da_3
A 1382.16 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 1391.06 I do not know , you could click and then have it up and down , ami_da_4
D 1391.06 but I think ami_da_3
D 1391.06 Yeah ami_da_9
D 1391.06 yeah ami_da_9
D 1391.06 yeah . ami_da_9
B 1398.45 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 1398.7 But the only thing is like , iPods are so expensive , ami_da_4
C 1398.7 like , it has to be ami_da_2
C 1398.7 is that part of ami_da_5
C 1398.7 yeah , ami_da_1
C 1398.7 I dunno , I dunno . ami_da_4
A 1403.09 Is that what makes them expensi ami_da_5
A 1403.09 I think it is all of ami_da_3
A 1403.09 they have so much memory though , ami_da_4
A 1403.09 that is it is ami_da_3
A 1403.09 Yeah . ami_da_9
B 1405.27 I do not think so . ami_da_4
C 1406.2 You do not think so ? ami_da_5
C 1406.2 Okay . ami_da_9
B 1407.03 I do not think it is the wheel dealy . ami_da_4
D 1408.12 I think it ami_da_3
D 1408.12 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 1409.78 I think it is the h it is their capabili ami_da_4
A 1409.78 I mean they it can hold what like five thousand songs or something . ami_da_4
C 1410.02 Okay . ami_da_1
B 1414.39 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 1414.75 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 1415.53 I am thinking ami_da_2
C 1415.53 we could ami_da_2
C 1415.53 if if we are hav So ba ami_da_3
C 1415.53 I mean but an iPod just has that circle thing you know . ami_da_4
B 1417.98 And they are re programmable are not they ? ami_da_5
B 1417.98 You can put on your songs and then put on a different set , that is probably why they are expensive , they are like little computers . ami_da_4
A 1419.59 Yeah . ami_da_4
A 1420.84 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 1421.53 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 1422.63 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 1423.41 S ami_da_3
C 1423.99 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 1425.3 Well like since it just has the circle thing , you could make it a qui a kind of cool shape , like it could be a cool sort of you know , because it could be circular , you know , or something weird like that , just ami_da_6
C 1425.3 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 1430.13 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 1434.25 Yeah ami_da_9
D 1434.25 yeah ami_da_9
D 1434.25 yeah . ami_da_9
D 1435.98 Well it could just be simple instead of being a l mass . ami_da_6
D 1439.5 Because , the other thing , I did not tell you all my presentation , is that people find it find that it is a big waste of time to have to learn how to use your remote and that is another thing they complained about . ami_da_4
C 1456.37 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 1457.24 , what other buttons were there ? ami_da_5
D 1457.24 Volume ami_da_4
D 1457.24 oh we have ami_da_4
D 1457.24 ts just said that . ami_da_4
C 1464.59 So okay . ami_da_2
D 1464.84 Channel selection . ami_da_4
C 1465.43 This is just for TV , it is not for or it is does need to be compatible with ami_da_5
C 1465.43 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 1469.1 I ami_da_3
B 1469.1 A DVD is simple , you just have play , pause , eject , and menu maybe . ami_da_4
A 1469.54 You know actually our our new project requirements , I am not sure if they meant o onl use only for television as in not for DVD or just not internet type things . ami_da_4
C 1473.68 So how do you switch ami_da_5
C 1473.68 Okay . ami_da_1
D 1473.76 Menu . ami_da_4
B 1482.52 Oh yeah . ami_da_1
A 1483.98 So I will I will check that and update you on the next ami_da_7
A 1483.98 But we will hold off on that because ami_da_6
A 1483.98 But s yeah . ami_da_2
C 1486.6 So like if we had that ami_da_3
C 1486.6 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 1490.99 But DVD players usually have their own remote . ami_da_4
C 1493.6 That is true , yeah . ami_da_9
A 1494.32 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 1495.17 So , I know I am not c really clear on what ami_da_3
C 1495.17 Yeah , ami_da_1
C 1495.17 yeah . ami_da_1
B 1496.22 But it is cool to have it all on one , because you want to turn it on then you want to turn up the volume , and then you want to go to the menu , so you do not want to switch . ami_da_9
D 1497.7 Yeah , ami_da_9
D 1497.7 yeah , ami_da_9
D 1497.7 yeah . ami_da_9
D 1500.73 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 1500.88 So you would have to have like ami_da_2
C 1500.88 I think you would have to have like a function switch button , you know somewhere ami_da_4
C 1500.88 so like you ami_da_4
C 1500.88 can you are either on TV , you are on DVD or you are on VCR , or you are like . ami_da_4
A 1509.27 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 1510.24 Well but DVD is only like four buttons . ami_da_4
C 1510.33 So ami_da_4
C 1510.33 Yeah , ami_da_9
C 1510.33 but I mean like to switch the fun so like to switch the function of the little circle disc , the touch pad . ami_da_4
D 1512.52 Yeah , it is only fun ami_da_9
A 1514.09 But i ami_da_3
A 1514.09 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 1518.49 Oh . ami_da_9
B 1518.82 But I think the circle only does ami_da_2
B 1518.82 channel is not applicable to DVD really because you do not want to but volume is and volume is actually controlled on the TV ami_da_4
B 1518.82 so you do not have to switch . ami_da_4
C 1523.6 Yeah ami_da_3
C 1523.6 but it ami_da_3
C 1523.6 it would be ami_da_3
C 1523.6 So but I am saying like , does it make sense to have like some kind of a button , ami_da_11
C 1523.6 so like you are if you are on TV , like you can switch channels , ami_da_4
C 1523.6 but then if if you are on DVD then like the channel bu like the the region of the disc that was for channels is for like switching to different tracks ami_da_4
C 1523.6 or s you know , to different ami_da_3
C 1523.6 I mean do we need to think about that , ami_da_11
A 1548.08 , yeah , let is think about it ami_da_9
A 1548.08 because we need to wrap up . ami_da_4
A 1550.99 let is see . ami_da_2
A 1553.55 so everyone is going to go finish their questionnaire , then when we come back after lunch we will have thirty minutes of individual work , ami_da_4
A 1553.55 yeah , so think about the things we have discussed and bring some new ideas to our next meeting . ami_da_6
