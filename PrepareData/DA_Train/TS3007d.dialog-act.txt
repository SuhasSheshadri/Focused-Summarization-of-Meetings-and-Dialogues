A 126.95 I ami_da_4
A 126.95 I received a an an Excel file which we have to fill in later on . ami_da_4
A 140.79 , you see . ami_da_16
A 142.48 , and then we must see if we stay under the twelve and a half Euro . ami_da_4
D 143.51 Interesting . ami_da_16
D 147.24 , okay . ami_da_9
A 148.77 So , that is that is a big l ami_da_3
A 148.77 so let is wait it ami_da_3
A 148.77 we have we have must , ami_da_2
A 148.77 we must have some time for that because it will be yeah , quite a lot of mathematics . ami_da_6
B 149.56 Oops . ami_da_16
D 150.25 Cool . ami_da_9
C 150.75 That is going to be t problem . ami_da_9
B 153.95 Some creative ami_da_3
B 153.95 Oh . ami_da_1
B 162.32 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 163.05 And after that , an evaluation of the process how we how we have done it here with the SMARTboard , with the with our laptops , with the all all this . ami_da_4
A 175.5 And afterwards , we closing . ami_da_4
A 177.27 Once again , forty minutes , ami_da_4
A 177.27 so let is start . ami_da_6
B 179.21 Ok okay . ami_da_1
A 180.01 I would g give the word to G and G for the prototype presentation . ami_da_6
B 183.54 Shall I give a short introduction and then ami_da_7
B 183.54 Okay . ami_da_1
C 186.67 Yeah , well sure . ami_da_9
D 187.13 J and J . ami_da_4
A 187.84 J and J . ami_da_9
D 189.96 Jane and Jane . ami_da_14
B 190.75 J and J , okay . ami_da_16
D 193.92 Okay guys , take it away . ami_da_6
C 195.09 Hi . ami_da_14
B 195.55 Take it away . ami_da_16
B 203.2 , this was our first concept . ami_da_4
B 204.87 We decided to use a single touch screen . ami_da_4
B 208.54 So , we have worked out this concepts , how to how to hold it , where to put the buttons and and stuff . ami_da_4
B 214.78 And , well , we began with with a form of shape , that is is easy to hold w in one hand , left or right handed . ami_da_4
B 222.35 So , we made i it a little bit less thick and it has some ar artistic meaning . ami_da_4
B 228.68 No ? ami_da_15
B 228.68 This is not nothing . ami_da_4
B 232.15 Idea maybe is better . ami_da_9
B 237.21 well , during the meeting I showed you the concept of placing the buttons on top , usable with your thumb , and the menu structure , if necessary , with your other hand , so it is just going to hold it easily . ami_da_4
B 250.06 And it has to be acce accessible with your other hand too , of course . ami_da_4
B 255.5 So we began working out a concept . ami_da_4
C 257.75 Yeah , well , and as you saw , we would just have the basic remote with the panel LCD screen . ami_da_4
C 264.97 Well , these would be the main buttons , h you could change them later on in your own profile if you want to . ami_da_4
C 269.77 But , well it is standard they will be delivered with this kind of set up . ami_da_4
C 273.85 We have the more advanced menu setting right here . ami_da_4
C 278.05 We have the sub menus and stu stuff . ami_da_4
C 280.59 We made a top oh , or a front view . ami_da_4
C 282.72 Just so like you want to back view . ami_da_4
C 285.38 As you can see , this there , there are two weird bumps in it . ami_da_4
C 291.12 This is for the added effect of well y youth and dynamic . ami_da_4
C 297.54 And this is for the artistic effect . ami_da_4
C 299.85 Well , what we figured is we will show you a picture later on ami_da_7
C 299.85 you have more b a better idea after that . ami_da_4
C 305.75 But , idea is for to stay in balance with these two with these two . ami_da_4
C 310.91 And so when you put it on the table , it will just lay down . ami_da_4
C 313.58 It wo not roll around or stuff . ami_da_4
C 316.15 But it will lie more in your hand like an old telephone maybe , or like these old phones . ami_da_4
C 321.81 Y you ami_da_4
C 321.81 you may get the idea . ami_da_4
C 324.0 So thi this is about how we figured it should be . ami_da_4
C 327.63 The s panel we g you would hide with some more rubber layers , like we discussed early on . ami_da_4
C 334.24 , you would s you would not see the straight panel , but more fluidly and round . ami_da_4
B 339.86 Yeah , ami_da_9
B 339.86 the panel just of course goes like this . ami_da_4
C 342.97 Yeah . ami_da_9
B 344.35 But the overlaying layer is a little bit curved and stuff . ami_da_4
D 348.85 Okay . ami_da_9
A 349.06 No , okay . ami_da_9
C 350.26 And , in these bumps you could actually put some electronics ami_da_4
C 350.26 that would ami_da_3
C 350.26 you can make a more thinner design , ami_da_4
C 350.26 and that would actually look very nice , ami_da_9
C 350.26 yeah . ami_da_9
D 358.78 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 360.97 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 362.8 And , about the colour , what have ami_da_3
C 362.8 Yeah , f , as colours , do you do you have the picture in ami_da_5
C 362.8 Oh yeah . ami_da_9
B 364.37 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 364.53 Oh , we added that this can be held with your hands for this maximum is om ami_da_4
B 364.53 yeah , one and a half centimetres . ami_da_4
B 371.87 So , you have room here for your battery and maybe even other electronic chips . ami_da_4
B 377.22 S and you can just be the the layer of the touchscreen and some have some wires underneath it to make it as thin as possible in the middle for good grip . ami_da_4
D 377.32 Okay . ami_da_1
B 391.81 Yeah . ami_da_4
C 393.53 Now , well this is the idea about the bumps . ami_da_4
C 395.83 , you can see there is a v a very youthful dynamic exterior . ami_da_4
C 401.98 It ami_da_2
C 401.98 you just want to hold it you you are young and dynamic like us . ami_da_4
D 405.34 Is l ami_da_2
D 405.34 it is like an Easter egg . ami_da_9
C 407.3 Yeah , it is like an e but this is for children . ami_da_9
B 407.63 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 409.06 We we want a more adult version . ami_da_4
C 410.88 But , this is like a remote control for children . ami_da_4
A 413.18 It is called a weemote ami_da_14
A 413.18 Weemote . ami_da_16
D 415.43 Weemote . ami_da_16
C 416.0 A weemote . ami_da_16
C 416.7 Yeah . ami_da_9
C 417.69 Hey , that is actually a brilliant marketing stand . ami_da_14
C 421.17 , but ami_da_2
C 421.17 So this actually basic the idea . ami_da_4
B 421.33 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 422.0 Wait what I w got in mind . ami_da_14
C 426.72 We we just want to build a more adult vers adult version of of this . ami_da_6
A 431.56 Yeah , I can imagine that . ami_da_9
C 432.88 And and for colours , we we figured starting with basic colours like white or metallic grey . ami_da_4
C 439.7 Those are the technological colours actually , ami_da_4
C 439.7 so it d ami_da_3
C 439.7 Or blue or whatever . ami_da_4
B 442.59 Yeah . ami_da_9
B 443.08 It would be best to to appeal to a broad public and make the covers exchangeable , ami_da_6
B 443.08 so the young people will buy an orange and a red and blue and a purple , but when the o older people go in the shop and they see an orange remote control , it would be less appealing than a white one . ami_da_4
B 463.04 And young people , we think , are a little bit more flexible , they think , I will buy for a couple of Euros some noi nice hip ami_da_4
B 463.04 Well , ami_da_2
B 463.04 I think a cover is necessary , ami_da_9
B 463.04 because als otherwise you will just have the LCD screen . ami_da_4
D 469.21 Maybe it is an idea to sell it without a cover , so that you can pick a cover in the in the shop . ami_da_6
D 477.24 Yeah , okay . ami_da_9
D 477.93 Yeah , okay . ami_da_9
B 479.27 So , there must be some cheap standard cover , maybe white or something , that is could comes with it and you can buy , ami_da_6
B 479.27 so we can make extra money . ami_da_4
A 486.69 Yeah , but you d you must not forget that our target aim is younger people . ami_da_9
D 487.64 Oui okay . ami_da_1
A 494.18 , we had decided to put some flashy fruity colours in it , and in the survey from Milan and Paris it it came out that the d the older people are more willing to to spend money on extra features . ami_da_4
B 517.6 Okay . ami_da_1
A 517.79 So I think it will be a better idea to have some flashy fruity colours as as a standard , ami_da_6
A 517.79 and for the people who really want a more sophisticated , more traditional look , they are willing to pay that . ami_da_4
B 522.03 The other way around , you mean . ami_da_9
C 524.44 Oh yeah . ami_da_9
B 529.48 Uh huh . ami_da_1
C 533.36 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 533.62 They want they want more luxury stuff , but they have the money to do it and they want to b to buy that . ami_da_4
B 539.58 Okay . ami_da_1
A 539.63 So , maybe it is an idea to put that as an extra and not as a standard . ami_da_6
D 540.03 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 542.41 Yeah . ami_da_9
C 543.39 Yeah , maybe yeah , perhaps you are right . ami_da_9
C 545.32 , I I would I would actually agree with this sounds logical . ami_da_9
B 548.9 Okay , yeah . ami_da_9
D 548.98 An another idea . ami_da_7
D 550.45 , maybe we could develop a cover with wood style . ami_da_6
A 556.64 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 556.88 They will please the elder users as well . ami_da_4
A 559.13 Yeah . ami_da_9
B 559.83 Well yeah , ami_da_9
B 559.83 a colour of ami_da_2
B 559.83 a wood style , a white c and a couple of h hip fruity colours . ami_da_6
A 565.45 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 565.53 Yes . ami_da_9
C 565.58 Nah . ami_da_9
B 565.87 And lea l delivered standard with a fruity colour , but not too not too much . ami_da_6
C 566.23 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 570.29 Not not too yeah . ami_da_9
B 571.69 This is banana and mango , not not purple or p orange and yellow . ami_da_6
D 575.85 Yeah , exactly . ami_da_9
A 576.46 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 577.42 But , the mai I think th the standard must be some kind of attractive flashy colours . ami_da_6
D 577.65 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 578.05 Or blue or ami_da_9
A 585.41 Not too , but w a little , ami_da_6
A 585.41 because that is our aim . ami_da_4
C 587.33 Yeah , ami_da_9
C 587.33 li like like this like this . ami_da_6
B 587.87 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 589.07 This is not this is not too much , is it ? ami_da_11
C 589.07 I f ami_da_3
C 589.07 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 589.24 Yeah . ami_da_9
B 590.82 Yeah , okay . ami_da_9
B 592.25 No . ami_da_9
B 592.52 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 592.84 Well , the buttons do not have to be all all of ami_da_9
A 592.84 yeah . ami_da_9
D 594.58 Well I I I think so . ami_da_9
C 595.05 The buttons , ami_da_9
C 595.05 I ami_da_3
C 595.05 Yeah , something like this would be nice . ami_da_9
D 596.57 Yeah , except for the buttons it is it could be a standard model . ami_da_9
A 599.09 It ami_da_3
A 599.09 Yeah . ami_da_9
B 600.16 Okay . ami_da_9
A 602.99 Okay . ami_da_1

B 856.15 have we deciding ? ami_da_5
B 856.15 So ami_da_3
B 856.15 It will make a difference . ami_da_9
D 859.88 Oh , okay , ami_da_9
D 859.88 but ami_da_3
D 862.77 If you put your normal remote control under your bed , or you throw this remote control under your bed , is it better findable ? ami_da_11
D 862.77 A li little bit maybe ? ami_da_11
D 862.77 Four ? ami_da_11
D 862.77 Fi I ami_da_3
D 862.77 , I I ami_da_9

C 1381.0 well you you can go from double curved to single curved . ami_da_6
A 1381.67 So ami_da_3
A 1381.67 , b but i but the single curved is just oh ami_da_4
A 1381.67 Oh , okay , okay . ami_da_9
D 1384.81 Yeah , of course . ami_da_9
C 1386.02 And that would solve the budget problem . ami_da_4
B 1388.29 Yeah , ami_da_9
B 1388.29 so we have to bake the ba back flat , and then ami_da_6
B 1388.29 No , it is it is just one curve and not a back curved I think . ami_da_4
C 1390.98 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 1393.0 It is just yeah ami_da_3
C 1393.0 well , the single curve that ami_da_3
C 1393.0 Yeah . ami_da_9
B 1398.5 Or ami_da_4
B 1398.5 Or are these two curves ? ami_da_5
B 1398.5 Yeah , ami_da_9
B 1398.5 but what else do we have to cut out ? ami_da_8
B 1398.5 No advanced chip , that is a little bit of problem . ami_da_4
C 1399.32 Exactly , yeah . ami_da_9
A 1399.99 So that is wh tha that is one option . ami_da_4
D 1400.32 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 1403.8 And then w yeah , ami_da_4
A 1403.8 and then we could have it , but it is its' ami_da_4
A 1403.8 well it is it is ami_da_4
A 1403.8 r it is the main point of the the the the look . ami_da_4
D 1406.02 Yeah , ami_da_1
D 1406.02 Yeah . ami_da_9
C 1413.57 We going to cut ami_da_3
C 1413.57 Yeah , we just make it flat . ami_da_9
A 1415.86 No , tho that that can be done . ami_da_9
A 1418.26 So , ami_da_3
A 1418.26 okay , a little less conversation . ami_da_6
B 1418.7 Although , can we make it with a regular chip ? ami_da_5
B 1418.7 Curvy . ami_da_3
D 1423.56 Hey , those ar arcs , why are there for ? ami_da_5
D 1423.56 The blue blue ami_da_4
D 1423.56 Okay . ami_da_9
A 1427.98 Sorry ? ami_da_12
A 1427.98 Fill in ami_da_3
A 1427.98 Just a ami_da_4
A 1427.98 explanation . ami_da_9
B 1433.74 Explanation . ami_da_4
B 1434.61 Twelve fifty . ami_da_4
A 1435.42 I can delete it for you if you want . ami_da_7
B 1435.53 Well ami_da_3
B 1435.53 Yeah , ami_da_9
B 1435.53 but does it fit with our design ? ami_da_11
B 1435.53 Do we have to u adapt it ? ami_da_8
B 1435.53 It is single curves . ami_da_9
D 1436.8 No , no no . ami_da_9
A 1437.89 So , if we do this , we are on twelve and a half Euro . ami_da_4
A 1443.45 And we are done . ami_da_4
A 1448.48 well , the only thing that do not ami_da_9
A 1448.48 Yeah , single curved , but there is a curve in it . ami_da_9
D 1453.07 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 1453.58 W ami_da_3
B 1453.58 Could we just make the bubbles cut off the back , and then we are has ami_da_6
B 1453.58 Okay . ami_da_9
A 1454.83 So Yeah , it is really a static value . ami_da_9
D 1460.54 But , wha Okay , look , what is the ami_da_2
D 1460.54 If you make it double curved , it costs one Euro more . ami_da_4
C 1460.89 But , you do l ami_da_3
C 1460.89 Function . ami_da_11
B 1469.14 More . ami_da_9
B 1469.94 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 1470.58 But ami_da_3
D 1470.58 No , ami_da_9
D 1470.58 but does it have a lot of extra fun function more like ami_da_11
D 1470.58 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 1470.73 You make it optional . ami_da_6
B 1478.4 Functional . ami_da_9
C 1479.68 Worth , does it have added worth ? ami_da_11
C 1479.68 No , ami_da_9
C 1479.68 Yeah , well let is assume it is . ami_da_4
B 1480.23 , there is an a a athe aesthetic value , but not functionality . ami_da_9
D 1484.1 Yeah , aesthetic . ami_da_9
A 1485.32 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 1486.42 I mean , you make like eleven and a half Euros profit instead of twelve and a half . ami_da_4
D 1494.74 But I do not know if twelve and a half is a fixed fixed price . ami_da_4
A 1501.48 Yeah , it is . ami_da_4
D 1501.5 No , we ca not go above that . ami_da_9
D 1502.99 Yeah ? ami_da_5
D 1502.99 Yeah , okay . ami_da_9
A 1503.06 Oh . ami_da_4
C 1503.11 We we should assume it i that it is . ami_da_4
A 1504.83 Yeah , okay . ami_da_9
B 1504.88 Yeah . ami_da_9
C 1505.49 But I I figured that the kinetic would be a marketing promotion . ami_da_4
D 1506.08 Then it is okay . ami_da_9
C 1509.46 R if you promote a kinetic ami_da_4
C 1509.46 I kinetic remote control , ami_da_4
C 1509.46 I mean , that would b sell better than an a normal remote control . ami_da_4
D 1519.12 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 1519.15 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 1520.21 Do you think ? ami_da_11
A 1520.21 Well , now you can shake your remote control . ami_da_4
D 1521.05 Yeah , I think so . ami_da_9
C 1523.48 No , well , y I mean , y you can go into your neighbour and tell him , ha , my k remote control is kinetic . ami_da_9
A 1528.85 Kinetic . ami_da_1
C 1528.88 You have standard old battery control remote con True . ami_da_9
B 1528.98 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 1530.18 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 1531.88 What a what about all the m the environment freaks ? ami_da_11
D 1531.88 Not freaks , ami_da_9
D 1531.88 the envi ami_da_3
D 1531.88 No . ami_da_9
B 1532.02 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 1535.99 Yeah , but it does not fit in our co cost profile . ami_da_9
B 1538.42 So ami_da_9
B 1538.42 You ma can make an an especialised extra gold version . ami_da_6
D 1539.95 I I think it is ami_da_9
D 1539.95 it is ami_da_9
D 1539.95 It look like this one . ami_da_9
A 1545.36 Yeah ? ami_da_11
A 1545.36 Who ami_da_3
A 1545.36 because if you want to go to kinetic , you are you are on thirteen and a half ami_da_4
A 1545.36 and you must go to flat , and I think now it is it is more of a compromise thing . ami_da_4
B 1557.67 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 1558.42 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 1560.67 And if you make the single curve ha just a big curve , ami_da_6
A 1560.67 then it is then it is ami_da_2
A 1560.67 yeah , one big good curve . ami_da_9
B 1567.28 Yeah , just one big curve . ami_da_9
A 1572.53 I was going to say nasty words , but I do not . ami_da_4
A 1576.49 This is strange by the way . ami_da_9
A 1578.8 Wood is m is is is cheaper than rubber . ami_da_4
A 1581.88 We thought that wood would be more expensive . ami_da_4
D 1582.01 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 1583.62 , this American figures . ami_da_9
B 1585.41 You just cut down some trees . ami_da_9
A 1587.0 Yeah , maybe . ami_da_9
A 1588.88 But that ami_da_2
A 1588.88 this is this is it ? ami_da_5
A 1588.88 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 1592.07 This is it . ami_da_4
A 1592.66 Okay , this is it . ami_da_9
B 1593.01 Whoever makes a remote control out of titanium . ami_da_9
A 1594.22 I am going to save it . ami_da_7
A 1596.9 Yeah . ami_da_9
B 1597.68 Yes . ami_da_9
C 1598.26 It is possible , but you ca not use double curves for titanium . ami_da_4
B 1603.11 No . ami_da_1
C 1603.73 That is one of the functionability ami_da_4
C 1603.73 Well , I th ami_da_9
C 1603.73 I think you two , especially you and and Daniel , you d you ami_da_9
C 1603.73 you both had the less creative roles in the project . ami_da_9
A 1605.66 Okay , well , ami_da_2
A 1605.66 considering we have ami_da_3
A 1605.66 Well , we were above , so we did a little redesign ami_da_9
A 1605.66 Okay , ami_da_2
A 1605.66 now it is about time to talk about this project . ami_da_4
D 1610.32 no , we have to do all those hours again . ami_da_14
D 1615.38 Go back . ami_da_6
D 1616.67 One back ? ami_da_6
D 1616.67 Costs on No redesign . ami_da_4
D 1624.66 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 1625.41 We sue . ami_da_14
D 1626.05 Yeah , ami_da_9
D 1626.05 okay , ami_da_9
D 1626.05 yeah . ami_da_9
B 1626.17 We ami_da_14
B 1626.17 Yeah , we will start her all o all over again . ami_da_14
A 1635.88 , some things . ami_da_4
A 1638.07 Were there room for ami_da_2
A 1638.07 was there room for creativity in our meetings or in your individual meetings ? ami_da_11
A 1638.07 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 1642.2 For us , there was a lot of creativity . ami_da_9
D 1644.98 I I did not think so . ami_da_9
D 1647.66 That there was a lot of room for it . ami_da_9
D 1650.97 But , that is mainly because of the information that was delivered to us . ami_da_9
D 1656.37 It was just fixed information and get your stuff from there , and I could not go on on i on the internet and search my own stuff . ami_da_4
A 1660.32 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 1663.39 Yeah , ami_da_9
A 1663.39 yeah , ami_da_9
A 1663.39 yeah . ami_da_9
D 1664.41 Bu ami_da_4
D 1664.41 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 1665.84 That is true . ami_da_9
A 1666.77 I agree with that . ami_da_9
A 1677.23 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 1678.2 That is true . ami_da_9
C 1679.41 Because I think m ami_da_3
C 1679.41 I think Jeroen and I , we had a more design we could have more we had more room for creativity than than you two . ami_da_9
B 1681.04 We could just sign up an remote if we liked . ami_da_4
A 1683.92 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 1684.32 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 1685.01 Yeah , that is true . ami_da_9
A 1692.92 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 1693.83 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 1694.72 Yeah , that is true . ami_da_9
A 1695.65 Okay . ami_da_2
A 1696.97 how about the leadership ? ami_da_11
A 1696.97 Okay , thank you very much . ami_da_14
B 1698.3 Crappy . ami_da_9
D 1699.9 Leadership was crappy . ami_da_14
C 1700.09 Ha . ami_da_16
C 1702.59 Nah , the leadership was not crappy , it was the leader that was crappy . ami_da_14
B 1702.74 Cra Yeah . ami_da_9
C 1705.81 Nah . ami_da_9
D 1706.34 Okay . ami_da_9
C 1707.67 No , the leadership was okay . ami_da_9
A 1710.02 Now we are done . ami_da_14
B 1711.0 Yeah , example of crappy leadershi ami_da_14
B 1711.0 Okay , yeah . ami_da_9
D 1713.82 No , leadership was ami_da_9
D 1713.82 Okay , I thought the first meeting was a little bit of unstructured meeting . ami_da_9
C 1716.54 Yeah , it was good . ami_da_9
A 1721.38 Yeah , that is true . ami_da_9
D 1721.83 , you could have ami_da_2
D 1721.83 but , it was your first , ami_da_9
D 1721.83 no no disrespect or something , ami_da_14
D 1721.83 but you could have structure it a l little bit more . ami_da_9
D 1730.03 So like , I I was talking most of the time the first meeting meeting , and ami_da_4
D 1730.03 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 1730.06 Yeah . ami_da_9
B 1734.61 You could of said , shut up you fool . ami_da_14
A 1735.8 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 1737.09 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 1737.64 But ami_da_3
D 1737.64 About me . ami_da_14
A 1737.8 I notice it too . ami_da_9
A 1738.49 I was a ami_da_9
A 1738.49 I was also very unhappy , very unsatisfied about the about the first meeting . ami_da_9
A 1746.04 So , I hope the the the other meetings get better and I think the the last two meetings also we we reached some good decisions about talk ami_da_9
A 1746.04 yeah . ami_da_9
D 1749.35 Yeah , you made up . ami_da_9
C 1749.39 Try to learn from your mistake . ami_da_14
C 1750.89 And we will never do it again . ami_da_14
D 1754.54 No , it you did better . ami_da_9
B 1759.37 Yeah , more more consensus . ami_da_9
D 1760.9 Yeah . ami_da_9
B 1760.91 Ev everybody w was agreeing every Yeah . ami_da_9
D 1762.5 Much more constructive . ami_da_9
A 1763.42 Okay , so that is cool . ami_da_9
A 1765.85 , teamwork ? ami_da_11
A 1765.85 Well , maybe that is only ami_da_4
A 1765.85 Yeah well , it is for us , because ami_da_9
A 1765.85 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 1770.3 Well , we work together on a project , but everybody has his own task . ami_da_4
A 1774.22 Yeah and it is wo more like presentation and some points were discussed . ami_da_9
B 1774.23 So , it is a little bit ami_da_3
B 1774.23 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 1777.94 But , really teamwork were you two ami_da_9
A 1777.94 The ami_da_3
A 1777.94 Yeah ? ami_da_11
A 1777.94 No hard feelings . ami_da_11
B 1778.45 No ami_da_9
B 1778.45 Well , it went okay . ami_da_9
D 1781.05 Two guys . ami_da_9
C 1782.42 Yeah , that went w ami_da_9
C 1782.42 it went well . ami_da_9
C 1783.81 It is it is just ami_da_3
C 1783.81 Nah . ami_da_9
B 1785.61 Stupid stupid pen , but ami_da_9
B 1785.61 Yeah , ami_da_9
B 1785.61 but but draw something difficult . ami_da_6
C 1788.1 Yeah , we we had some trouble with the pen , but ami_da_9
C 1788.1 Yeah , but us ami_da_3
C 1788.1 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 1789.94 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 1790.96 Now you you must push a little while . ami_da_4
B 1796.28 D just write your name right now . ami_da_6
B 1798.36 Try to write your name , in in writing letters , of course , yeah ? ami_da_6
B 1798.36 Yeah , normally , this ami_da_2
B 1798.36 the w Block letter sign it , ami_da_6
B 1798.36 yeah ? ami_da_6
B 1798.36 Just just write your name in in one line . ami_da_6
A 1799.35 Okay . ami_da_7
A 1811.82 O Just ami_da_3
A 1811.82 okay . ami_da_7
B 1814.45 If it is a little bit too small ami_da_3
B 1814.45 bit quicker now . ami_da_6
B 1817.8 It did not ami_da_3
B 1817.8 he he knows how it works , yeah . ami_da_9
A 1817.88 You can be you can go quicker , because then it it wo not notice it . ami_da_9
A 1824.95 I follow the Master class for the SMARTboard , so I think that is the that is the main issue . ami_da_4
C 1824.99 Oh . ami_da_9
D 1830.14 Okay . ami_da_9
A 1830.94 , so about this one you were you are dealing with , ami_da_4
A 1830.94 the the the the digital pen . ami_da_11
D 1832.14 Means . ami_da_16
B 1837.34 Y well , yeah . ami_da_9
B 1838.56 Th the i ami_da_3
B 1838.56 The idea is great , but it does not work properly . ami_da_9
A 1842.29 Okay . ami_da_9
D 1843.57 Digital pen , I thought th the first time I did individual work , I used it . ami_da_4
A 1843.6 Yeah . ami_da_9
B 1843.74 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 1848.86 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 1849.21 But , a and the first two meetings I brought it with me , but I did not use it at all after the first the first meeting . ami_da_4
A 1855.15 No . ami_da_1
C 1856.26 No , I have it working . ami_da_4
C 1857.19 But , yeah , well ami_da_3
C 1857.19 No , it does not have that much added value to the Yeah . ami_da_9
D 1858.52 It is it is not real real use for me . ami_da_9
A 1861.2 Huh . ami_da_1
B 1862.48 Nee . ami_da_9
A 1862.88 Well ami_da_3
A 1862.88 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 1863.27 As as I said a m a c few moments ago , it I would like , myself , to write with a normal pen , ami_da_9
B 1863.27 because must Yeah , it is almost the same concept , but you can just sim more simply put it on our scanner . ami_da_4
B 1876.73 I it is the same concept as the pen , where you f have to download the software or s very slow . ami_da_4
A 1877.68 M yeah . ami_da_1
A 1882.18 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 1883.94 And it is still your own handwriting popping up in Word . ami_da_4
B 1885.76 Yes . ami_da_9
B 1886.16 No , and it does not give any added value . ami_da_9
A 1889.21 No , that is true . ami_da_9
D 1889.61 Not really , no . ami_da_9
A 1890.67 No . ami_da_9
A 1892.09 And the SMARTboard is useful , but the the pen is I not user friendly , I think . ami_da_9
B 1898.34 Yeah , not user friendly . ami_da_9
A 1899.45 Be it it takes a lot of time to draw things and to write things , ami_da_9
A 1899.45 and that is the ami_da_3
A 1899.45 Yeah , but that is not th the the you ami_da_2
A 1899.45 when you at a foreign audience , you b do not going to wr write small . ami_da_9
B 1902.11 Yeah , and it is it is not very precise . ami_da_9
B 1904.12 We are trying to m to ami_da_3
B 1904.12 Yeah , it may ami_da_2
B 1904.12 Yeah , and tr try to wri write your name in a in a normal size , ami_da_6
B 1904.12 yeah . ami_da_6
D 1904.23 Yeah , ami_da_9
D 1904.23 like when you do this . ami_da_4
B 1914.31 Smaller . ami_da_6
D 1915.73 Smaller ? ami_da_8
D 1915.73 Oh . ami_da_14
B 1916.46 Yeah , smaller . ami_da_6
B 1917.24 Just like when you are writing on a letter . ami_da_4
B 1925.62 No , ami_da_9
B 1925.62 a as you saw on on this drawing , just open open this one or that one . ami_da_6
B 1931.1 It is th it it ami_da_2
B 1931.1 Yeah , we had more problems even here when we trying to draw these buttons , it is almost impossible to get clear when you are ami_da_9
B 1931.1 And the eraser was another problem . ami_da_9
A 1938.53 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 1942.6 Sorry . ami_da_14
A 1942.66 But maybe there is some function with ami_da_4
A 1942.66 no , it is not . ami_da_9
A 1945.75 With ami_da_3
A 1945.75 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 1947.76 It w t is is this large . ami_da_4
B 1949.6 And when you try to erase this line , y ami_da_9
B 1949.6 I am going to erase my name there . ami_da_7
A 1953.36 Well , I am going to erase my name . ami_da_7
A 1958.61 Yeah , it is a big big eraser . ami_da_9
D 1960.13 Okay . ami_da_2
D 1961.08 New ideas ? ami_da_11
D 1961.08 Do you ? ami_da_16
D 1961.08 Go on . ami_da_6
B 1962.47 M Abo ami_da_5
B 1962.47 What kind of new ideas ? ami_da_5
B 1962.47 Yeah , ami_da_3
B 1962.47 New ideas about the working of this software , about about the project , about the remote controls or ami_da_5
B 1962.47 Hello . ami_da_16
A 1963.29 Well , the the idea of the touch screen is ami_da_4
A 1963.29 I am just ami_da_3
A 1963.29 I do not know what what I mean . ami_da_4
D 1978.15 Yeah . ami_da_4
D 1979.06 , yeah , I think so . ami_da_4
D 1990.98 Did you heard what he said ? ami_da_5
D 1990.98 I do not ami_da_4
D 1990.98 I do not know what I mean . ami_da_9
A 1992.95 No . ami_da_1
C 1993.89 Know what I mean . ami_da_4
D 1998.26 Oh , I have some figure . ami_da_4
D 2000.59 Here . ami_da_4
D 2001.5 The eva the evaluation , the the mean number is one point eight one point eight six . ami_da_4
A 2001.66 Oh . ami_da_16
A 2004.13 Oh yeah . ami_da_9
A 2010.53 That is interesting . ami_da_9
D 2010.88 So that is fairly fairly good , I think . ami_da_9
A 2012.98 Okay , ami_da_9
A 2012.98 because what does it mean ? ami_da_5
A 2012.98 All the mo ami_da_4
A 2012.98 yeah , are between one and two . ami_da_4
B 2013.01 Yeah . ami_da_9
B 2014.89 So true . ami_da_4
D 2015.3 , that ami_da_2
D 2015.3 all the requirements are true or very true , right . ami_da_4
A 2021.94 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 2022.6 Oh , okay . ami_da_9
D 2023.45 Yep . ami_da_4
A 2023.94 Yeah , okay . ami_da_9
A 2025.61 Thank you , expert . ami_da_14
A 2029.72 But the new ideas found for wi with working with this software ? ami_da_11
A 2029.72 Not really , yeah ? ami_da_9
A 2029.72 Yeah , I think ami_da_9
A 2029.72 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 2034.97 Not really , just they have to improve it . ami_da_9
B 2037.49 , the concept is okay , but it has to be quicker . ami_da_9
B 2041.75 , it is still opening my programme , n almo almost my entire computer is locked up during the process ami_da_4
B 2041.75 and it , yeah , just takes too many time . ami_da_9
B 2051.07 People will still feel the need to to write it quickly on a page and not download it and save it , and More user friendly . ami_da_9
A 2054.68 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 2058.17 You had expected it to to be more more ami_da_9
A 2058.17 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 2065.41 Because when you use a pen , you can just draw like you d draw normally , ami_da_4
B 2065.41 and you do ami_da_3
B 2065.41 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 2067.58 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 2068.85 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 2069.88 May maybe the idea you proposed is a screen here . ami_da_9
D 2075.71 And draw it , and it is it is placed over there . ami_da_9
A 2076.61 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 2077.66 Yeah , that l ami_da_1
B 2077.66 Would be easier . ami_da_9
A 2079.41 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 2080.48 Or at least when you you do not have to adapt to the technology , just you can write in the way you normally write . ami_da_9
D 2087.74 No . ami_da_1
B 2088.05 And now you have to keep constantly in mind that you are drawing on this screen . ami_da_4
B 2092.91 And that is a very bad concept . ami_da_9
A 2093.42 Yep , yep . ami_da_1
A 2095.52 Yeah , that is true . ami_da_9
D 2095.8 , very bad . ami_da_9
B 2097.04 Nah , okay , ami_da_3
B 2097.04 I I ami_da_3
B 2097.04 it is my opinion ami_da_3
B 2097.04 that I ami_da_3
B 2097.04 Yeah , it is can be saved easier . ami_da_9
D 2097.2 But ami_da_3
D 2097.2 I think this is better than regular flip overs , ami_da_9
D 2097.2 but ami_da_3
D 2097.2 Yeah . ami_da_9
B 2105.89 But if you are in normal flip over you a lot of people write text . ami_da_4
B 2110.22 There is no text option . ami_da_4
D 2110.24 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 2111.79 And writing text , yeah , you have gotta really do your best to write some ami_da_4
B 2111.79 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 2116.34 Yeah , ami_da_9
A 2116.34 and and maybe some functions for circle or a square . ami_da_9
A 2125.42 You have to draw it yourself now . ami_da_4
B 2126.95 Or maybe even insert picture . ami_da_9
D 2127.4 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 2129.3 If you have some presentation , and you have some f ami_da_9
B 2129.3 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 2130.94 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 2131.36 Or text function . ami_da_9
C 2132.43 Just t t type text , and that that would be excellent . ami_da_9
C 2135.63 Mean ami_da_3
C 2135.63 Oh . ami_da_16
A 2136.11 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 2136.28 Yeah , ami_da_9
D 2136.28 but insert image is not available ? ami_da_5
D 2136.28 Here . ami_da_4
B 2141.31 Because then you could ami_da_3
B 2141.31 Oh , okay . ami_da_9
D 2142.3 Picture from scanner , clip art . ami_da_4
A 2143.58 Yeah , that that can be done already . ami_da_9
A 2146.07 But not the the the the predefined squares I think ami_da_4
A 2146.07 Sorry ? ami_da_12
A 2146.07 Well , that is nice . ami_da_9
B 2146.16 So you can ami_da_3

B 2190.4 Well , it is ami_da_3
B 2190.4 Yeah , okay . ami_da_9
A 2190.46 So you have ami_da_3
A 2190.46 as you saw , you have a little ami_da_4
A 2190.46 Oh , you can ami_da_3
A 2190.46 Yeah , ami_da_9
A 2190.46 thank you . ami_da_14
A 2199.22 You can go there . ami_da_4
A 2204.05 So there the the the functionality is there , ami_da_4
A 2204.05 but it is not it is not ideal , ami_da_9
A 2204.05 and it is it is very ami_da_2
A 2204.05 it costs a lot of time to ami_da_4
A 2204.05 to use . ami_da_9
B 2206.87 But . ami_da_3
B 2211.81 To use , yeah . ami_da_4
D 2213.47 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 2213.66 And that is a pity , ami_da_9
A 2213.66 if you if you have thirty , forty minutes for this kind of things , and we are now with four people , ami_da_4
A 2213.66 but it ami_da_2
A 2213.66 well , imagine you are here you are with the ten people and everyone ami_da_4
A 2213.66 Yeah . ami_da_9
B 2218.18 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 2219.26 And that is m ami_da_3
B 2219.26 That is mostly the case , ami_da_9
B 2219.26 from the over here with the managements you get two minutes to make your case , and if you have to do all this kind ami_da_4
B 2219.26 You will rather use PowerPoint and work it out in advance . ami_da_9
A 2230.93 Two minutes of drawing , yeah . ami_da_9
D 2232.5 Yep . ami_da_1
A 2235.86 Yeah . ami_da_9
B 2236.53 And th the one or two things you have to draw when you are there , just use a flip board . ami_da_9
A 2238.89 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 2241.47 What I really miss also is ami_da_9
D 2241.47 is a d is a turtle ami_da_14
D 2241.47 is a decision decision system ami_da_9
D 2241.47 like With the evaluation , you have to Polls like , what do you want , a one , a two , ami_da_4
D 2241.47 maybe a a l a little application like give your own number and click one two three four five six seven . ami_da_9
A 2261.73 Yeah yeah . ami_da_9
B 2262.82 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 2272.7 Yeah , just like he said with the with the a screen which you can write , also a kind of voting mechanism . ami_da_9
D 2277.5 Yeah , j ju ju yeah , v voting application . ami_da_9
D 2280.46 Just a little group group decision application . ami_da_9
A 2280.73 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 2283.26 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 2283.76 But , problem is , well you ca not discuss anything well you ami_da_9
C 2283.76 you ca you can , ami_da_9
C 2283.76 but you will discuss a lot less than l like we did now . ami_da_9
D 2292.66 Yeah . ami_da_9
C 2293.12 We I mean w w ami_da_4
C 2293.12 w one one person ami_da_4
C 2293.12 s maybe said three . ami_da_4
C 2297.26 But , well I we said , no I w th think two , because this and this , and then you can react on it . ami_da_4
C 2303.62 But if you you put a three on it , just figure well ami_da_9
C 2303.62 , everybody knows what I am knowing , so they will all just put a two on . ami_da_9
D 2303.62 Yeah , okay . ami_da_9
D 2311.32 Yeah , of course . ami_da_9
D 2311.95 But , you can still discuss about it , but but click it in an application , that is a lot easier to process . ami_da_9
C 2316.13 Yeah , but it would ami_da_9
C 2316.13 yeah . ami_da_9
C 2321.68 Yeah okay , the for processing part . ami_da_9
D 2322.97 The digit . ami_da_9
D 2323.55 Yeah . ami_da_9
C 2324.37 But then , I think the idea of one person entering it and the rest discussing it , that is not that bad idea , actually . ami_da_9
D 2332.11 Yeah . ami_da_9
C 2333.88 Not that your opinion is not valued , but but still . ami_da_9
D 2337.38 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 2339.22 Yeah . ami_da_9

A 2533.4 because yeah . ami_da_9
B 2541.28 Yeah . ami_da_9
B 2541.79 Well , okay , maybe you can add it later that we decided in the end because of the cost . ami_da_6
