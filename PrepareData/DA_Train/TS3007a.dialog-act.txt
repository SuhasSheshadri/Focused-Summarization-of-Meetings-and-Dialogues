A 181.52 I w ami_da_3
A 181.52 there must be a new remote control . ami_da_4
A 184.52 first of all it must be original , and trendy . ami_da_4
A 188.72 That is two things really close to each other . ami_da_4
A 192.32 But at the same time user friendly . ami_da_4
A 194.37 And they have ami_da_3
A 194.37 Yeah , ami_da_2
A 194.37 that is very important for them . ami_da_4
A 199.68 there are three stages . ami_da_4
A 201.74 There is a functional design . ami_da_4
A 203.45 So ami_da_2
A 203.45 what are we going to to do ? ami_da_4

A 215.86 How are going to do it ? ami_da_4
A 215.86 And that is really global . ami_da_4
A 220.69 because at the detailed design , how , part two , we go to dig in really about how the the te the technical of If it is it is possible technical wise . ami_da_6
A 234.58 each stage is is broken up in two two stages , individual work and a meeting . ami_da_4
A 244.68 So it is it is very straightforward . ami_da_9
A 248.65 Okay , ami_da_2
A 248.65 the tool training . ami_da_7
A 249.8 We have two smart boards . ami_da_4
A 252.09 This one is for the presentations , the PowerPoint presentations or the Word presentation of whatever you you had . ami_da_4
A 259.67 and this is only for drawing . ami_da_4
A 264.3 So ami_da_2
A 264.3 we must let it stand on this this programme . ami_da_6
A 269.85 This is called a smart board thing ami_da_4
A 269.85 Yeah , ami_da_9
A 269.85 it speaks for itself . ami_da_14
D 273.55 Speaks for itself . ami_da_14
A 277.01 and as you may have heard , the documents in the shared folder can be showed on this screen . ami_da_4
A 284.01 Not in y the the My Documents . ami_da_4
A 285.58 So if you want to show something , put it in the shared folder . ami_da_6
A 290.42 This is very straightforward , with the save , the print , the undo , the blank , the select , the pen . ami_da_9
A 297.92 Well , ami_da_2
A 297.92 I do not going to explain it all , ami_da_7
A 297.92 because I think you know how it works . ami_da_4

A 311.39 We we may not delete anything . ami_da_6
A 313.42 So if you have drawn something , save it . ami_da_6
A 316.7 Never delete it . ami_da_6
A 317.64 That is a very important thing . ami_da_9
A 321.47 Okay . ami_da_2
A 322.67 little little kind of exercise to know each other . ami_da_6

A 333.18 Every every one of us must draw our favourite animal , and tell tell us why we had chosen that animal . ami_da_6
A 344.53 important is that we use different colours , and different pen widths . ami_da_6
A 350.73 Widths . ami_da_6

A 946.55 Yeah ? ami_da_5
A 946.55 Yeah , a little . ami_da_4
C 947.38 Where does the pen go ? ami_da_8
C 947.38 Just ami_da_3
C 947.38 I figured the rabbit was actually the most impressive . ami_da_9
D 956.87 Let is go on then . ami_da_6
A 961.34 Well , ami_da_2
A 961.34 I think the dog is the the most artistic . ami_da_9
A 967.91 Do not choose for youself . ami_da_6
C 968.86 Oh , sorry . ami_da_14
A 968.9 That is selfish . ami_da_15
A 970.11 Okay , ami_da_2
A 970.11 now we are going to dig into the to the serious stuff . ami_da_6
D 970.6 It is pretty abstract . ami_da_4
A 974.72 the selling price for the remote will be twenty five Euro , and the production cost may not be more than twenty and a half Euro . ami_da_4
A 985.8 So ami_da_2
A 985.8 from my point of view , I do not think it is going to be very very high tech , high definition , ultra modern kind of remote , for twelve fift twelve and a half Euro . ami_da_9
A 1000.97 the profit we must make with the new remote is fifty million Euro . ami_da_4
A 1009.18 So that is a lot . ami_da_9
A 1009.89 We have to sell a lot of I think w when the selling price is twenty five , you got two million , two million remotes . ami_da_4
B 1011.51 Yeah , ami_da_9
B 1011.51 how much is it ? ami_da_5
B 1011.51 Hundred million remotes or something ? ami_da_5
B 1011.51 Oh yeah . ami_da_1
D 1012.37 Like how much ? ami_da_5
D 1012.37 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 1018.14 Twenty million . ami_da_4
C 1020.71 Two million , oh ami_da_9
C 1020.71 yeah , two million . ami_da_9
C 1022.12 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 1022.23 But our marketing range is , market range is international . ami_da_4
A 1026.02 So we have virtually the whole world we can sell we can sell our r remotes to . ami_da_4
A 1033.28 At least that countries which have a television . ami_da_4
A 1040.46 So ami_da_2
A 1040.46 now it is time for us to going to discuss a little things . ami_da_6
A 1047.06 You can think about experience with a remote control yourself , at home . ami_da_6
A 1052.24 What you think might be a useful new feature . ami_da_8
A 1056.57 What what can distinguish our new trendy remote control from all the others . ami_da_8
A 1062.72 so ami_da_2
A 1062.72 let is let is discuss a little . ami_da_6
A 1067.6 I am going to join you at the table . ami_da_7
A 1072.43 Well ami_da_2
A 1072.43 what what is the most important thing at a remote control ? ami_da_5
A 1072.43 Okay . ami_da_12
B 1077.74 well ami_da_2
B 1077.74 I think the most important thing of a remote control is that you can switch channels . ami_da_4
B 1083.14 And my opinion is you should keep it as basic as possible . ami_da_6
B 1087.4 Is it possible to open pen drawings in this on this screen ? ami_da_5
B 1087.4 but which ami_da_3
B 1087.4 The ones we made on the ami_da_4
B 1087.4 Oh , only in Word , okay . ami_da_12
A 1087.69 So not a not a remote control who which can can be used for television and a DVD and radio ami_da_11
A 1087.69 and Or just only If you have them on ami_da_3
A 1087.69 I can ami_da_3
A 1087.69 Okay . ami_da_9
D 1096.58 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 1098.0 I think so . ami_da_9
D 1098.73 but I have some points . ami_da_7
D 1100.01 Can I show them on the on the big screen ? ami_da_11
D 1100.01 Maybe ? ami_da_11
D 1100.01 Yeah . ami_da_7
D 1105.18 Yeah , I can find . ami_da_7
A 1118.79 Oh , ami_da_2
A 1118.79 in case you want it ami_da_4
A 1118.79 This is a dead kind of fly . ami_da_4
A 1122.76 Between the the the , yeah , the the Yeah , be The screens . ami_da_4
D 1127.16 Screen ? ami_da_5
D 1127.16 Okay . ami_da_12
A 1132.11 No no no . ami_da_4
A 1132.72 Only ami_da_3
A 1132.72 All the drawings go there , at the left ami_da_4
A 1132.72 Oh , that pen drawings . ami_da_12
A 1142.05 no , I think when it is in Word and you have saved it in the Shared Documents folder , you can show it there . ami_da_4
A 1149.41 Yeah . ami_da_4
D 1150.02 Okay , ami_da_2
D 1150.02 I have some points from marketing point of view . ami_da_7
A 1153.02 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 1153.44 just the standard thing li things like intuitive , small , fairly cheap . ami_da_6
D 1160.3 it is pretty cheap , twenty five Euros . ami_da_4
D 1163.09 brand independent . ami_da_6
D 1165.07 I think , it does not have to matter which brand your TV or other thing is . ami_da_6
A 1170.68 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 1172.08 Five minutes ? ami_da_12
D 1172.08 Okay , ami_da_12
D 1172.08 I will wrap it up quickly . ami_da_7
A 1173.44 Okay . ami_da_2
A 1174.29 Five minutes . ami_da_4
A 1176.19 Yeah . ami_da_4
D 1177.67 I personally think it has to be multi purpose . ami_da_6
D 1181.91 most of the remote c remote controls are just for one purpose . ami_da_4
A 1182.27 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 1187.16 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 1187.35 And by making it multi purpose , it has a new feature , adds a new feature to the market , and distinguish from from current products . ami_da_4
D 1197.82 maybe some other technology than infrared . ami_da_6
D 1201.38 I rather find it very annoying , like when someone is standing in front of the TV then you ca not switch it . ami_da_9
D 1209.5 think about sending it over radio waves or bluetooth . ami_da_6
A 1214.49 Okay . ami_da_1
A 1215.44 Okay . ami_da_1
D 1216.01 That might be a little bit expensive . ami_da_9
D 1219.2 And something like an LCD screen . ami_da_6
B 1224.84 For what purpose ? ami_da_5
B 1224.84 We ami_da_3
B 1224.84 And and the price . ami_da_6
D 1226.26 like I said here Maybe it is easy . ami_da_3
D 1231.42 It is nice as an added feature feature , ami_da_9
D 1231.42 that , when you are on a certain channel , you can see on the LCD screen what programmes are coming up or ami_da_4
D 1231.42 From my point of view , yeah . ami_da_9
A 1240.59 Okay . ami_da_1
A 1242.37 So it be a multi purpose very technically high remote ? ami_da_11
A 1242.37 Yeah , ami_da_12
A 1242.37 it must be really innovative , technical wise ? ami_da_11
A 1242.37 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 1255.25 Yeah , ami_da_9
D 1255.25 it has to be ami_da_3
D 1255.25 Yeah , ami_da_2
D 1255.25 our company is very good in making new innovative things . ami_da_9
A 1268.07 So yeah , ami_da_2
A 1268.07 I I agree with you . ami_da_9
D 1268.83 So i i ami_da_3
D 1268.83 i ami_da_3
D 1268.83 i ami_da_3
D 1268.83 To the current market . ami_da_6
A 1269.79 So we must focus on things who are really really add something to to ami_da_6
A 1269.79 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 1277.38 Look , ami_da_2
D 1277.38 you got some cheap remote controls there . ami_da_4
D 1282.09 They just ami_da_3
D 1282.09 Yeah , ami_da_2
D 1282.09 you got a dozen of them . ami_da_4
A 1286.13 No . ami_da_1
D 1287.36 But when you enter a new market with a remote control and want to gain market share you have to do something special , I think . ami_da_6
A 1295.41 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 1297.8 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 1299.38 But we have to keep an eye that it is ami_da_3
A 1299.38 at the beginning of such a project , it is it is it is very cool to talk about , well , this would be cool , that would be cool . ami_da_4
D 1309.4 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 1310.05 but we must not lose sight of the the user friendly ami_da_6
A 1310.05 Yeah okay . ami_da_12
D 1316.66 Yeah , of course . ami_da_9
D 1317.91 But it is ami_da_3
D 1317.91 But but this is just from marketing aspect . ami_da_4
A 1321.74 Yeah . ami_da_12
D 1322.55 I do not know anything about user interface or design . ami_da_4
A 1322.7 Okay . ami_da_12
B 1324.73 Okay . ami_da_1
A 1326.79 And that is because we have him . ami_da_4
C 1328.84 And and him . ami_da_4
B 1329.4 And him . ami_da_4
A 1332.84 Okay , ami_da_2
A 1332.84 next meeting will start in thirty minutes . ami_da_4
A 1335.94 So ami_da_2
A 1335.94 you will have individual actions where I presume will be some feedback , via the m the mail . ami_da_4
A 1345.95 the the the Industrial Designer has to look at the working design . ami_da_4
A 1354.76 the User Interface Designer has to look at the technical functions . ami_da_4
A 1359.87 So ami_da_2
A 1359.87 that is the thing we discussed . ami_da_4
B 1360.48 Yeah . ami_da_2
B 1361.09 one thing , ami_da_7
B 1361.09 we must first agree on what we are going to m going to make . ami_da_6
A 1362.83 Yeah ? ami_da_5
A 1362.83 Okay . ami_da_12
B 1366.88 Do we ami_da_3
B 1366.88 Are we going to use it it for multiple systems ? ami_da_11
B 1366.88 Or ami_da_3
B 1366.88 We should have some agreement on that before we ami_da_6
B 1366.88 Okay . ami_da_9
A 1374.54 wha ami_da_3
A 1374.54 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 1375.89 I I do not think we have to be , we have to agree on that . ami_da_9
D 1380.19 I think th that is a pha ami_da_3
D 1380.19 Yeah . ami_da_9
C 1382.88 I figure we could get back to it on the next meeting actually . ami_da_6
D 1386.01 That is a phase further . ami_da_4
C 1387.16 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 1387.91 Ju just ami_da_3
D 1387.91 make some mock ups , some some general ideas . ami_da_6
B 1394.69 okay . ami_da_12
D 1395.12 And and then we can plan ami_da_6
D 1395.12 Yeah . ami_da_2
D 1400.84 We can plan further , I think . ami_da_6
A 1402.26 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 1404.34 But maybe , because you are working on the user requirements , you are working on the technical functions , ami_da_4
A 1404.34 we must have a little or kind of ami_da_6
A 1404.34 How do you call it ? ami_da_5
A 1404.34 a little plan on on what we are going to do . ami_da_6
B 1418.07 Consensus on the , what we are going to do . ami_da_4
A 1422.23 So you do not come up with the user requirements who do not fit the the the the technical functions at all . ami_da_4
A 1431.04 Some basic things we co ami_da_6
A 1431.04 we want to going to do . ami_da_6
A 1434.33 I think that is well ami_da_3
A 1434.33 Yeah . ami_da_3
A 1437.64 Will come in handy . ami_da_9
D 1439.03 yeah . ami_da_2
D 1443.09 I do not know . ami_da_9
B 1443.35 Yeah . ami_da_1

A 1446.47 Yeah . ami_da_1

B 1453.01 Or will it be with with bluetooth or ami_da_11
B 1453.01 Okay . ami_da_12
A 1457.89 Well , ami_da_2
A 1457.89 th that is that is really a step further . ami_da_4
A 1460.27 But if you say is it one way or multi purpose , that is a ami_da_4
A 1460.27 Why ? ami_da_5
A 1460.27 Why ? ami_da_5
A 1460.27 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 1466.3 tha that is a same step further . ami_da_9
C 1468.6 Yeah , actually it is . ami_da_9
D 1469.62 Yeah . ami_da_16
C 1471.31 Then looking at individual components , so that is actually a f step further . ami_da_4
