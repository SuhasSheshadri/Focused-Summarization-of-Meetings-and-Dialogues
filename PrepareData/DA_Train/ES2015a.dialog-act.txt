A 332.97 Same with conceptual design and detailed design . ami_da_4
A 336.92 So , , ami_da_2
A 336.92 making sure that it , it is usable , ami_da_4

A 440.59 Yeah it is got like big antlers , ami_da_4
A 440.59 yeah . ami_da_9
A 460.32 Looks kind of like , like it has holly growing out of its head . ami_da_4

A 475.14 Okay , . ami_da_2
B 477.91 Sheep . ami_da_9
B 478.38 Yeah , ami_da_9
B 478.38 cows . ami_da_4
B 483.86 That is a great elk . ami_da_9
D 484.21 Uh oh , we have a good artist . ami_da_9
C 484.86 That is really good . ami_da_9
B 486.07 Yeah . ami_da_9
C 486.85 I am quite ami_da_3
C 486.85 Very good . ami_da_9
A 487.23 Thanks . ami_da_14
A 490.35 This is my ami_da_3
A 490.35 Okay . ami_da_2
D 492.87 Oh , ami_da_16
D 492.87 very shapely . ami_da_9
B 494.84 Brilliant . ami_da_9
A 495.68 That is a sketching of my my elk , and it , it is my favourite animal right now , because it is a large beautiful majestic creature , ami_da_4
A 495.68 that , that ami_da_3
A 495.68 In a way it looks kind of awkward , because it is on spindly legs ami_da_4
A 495.68 and it ami_da_3
A 495.68 But it can really overcome harsh terrain , and although it is gorgeous it is also very dangerous , because it has strong antlers , ami_da_4
A 495.68 and ami_da_2
A 495.68 it can really combat its enemies , even like it it is a it is an herbivore but , , it can really defend itself . ami_da_4
B 533.94 Very nice . ami_da_9
A 534.02 Yeah . ami_da_9
B 534.86 Okay . ami_da_2
A 535.56 Right . ami_da_2
A 550.35 Right , ami_da_2
A 550.35 I am going to take minutes ami_da_7
A 550.35 while , , you guys express your favourite animals . ami_da_6
B 553.25 Okay , I will go next . ami_da_7
B 557.54 I am a big animal lover . ami_da_4
B 559.47 like all sorts of animals , but for the moment I am going to draw a cat , in memory of my poor cat that died recently . ami_da_4
D 565.68 Oh . ami_da_16
A 566.02 Oh . ami_da_16
B 570.81 It is going to be a bit of a strange drawing , ami_da_4
B 570.81 but never mind . ami_da_9
B 591.47 Not as artistic as Heather is drawing . ami_da_9
B 593.3 Bit more cartoon style . ami_da_9
B 595.13 But I like cats because they are so independent , and they always seem to be doing what they want to be doing . ami_da_4
B 601.85 , but that does not mean they are completely not sociable , because they enjoy interacting with humans as well , and they seem to enjoy the good things like sunshine and , , running around outside as well as being inside , and enjoying their food , and generally just , they just seemed so cool and they just know what they are doing . ami_da_4
B 624.8 I reckon they are sort of , they got it sorted . ami_da_4
B 627.55 They know what they want . ami_da_4
B 629.41 Basically , that is why I like cats . ami_da_4
A 632.21 Great . ami_da_9
B 632.96 I will rub that out . ami_da_7
B 640.31 There you go . ami_da_16
C 642.49 Okay . ami_da_2
C 643.3 I think my favourite animal would be a dog , but I am not really sure how to draw one . ami_da_4
B 649.21 Ooh . ami_da_16
C 649.91 I , I have never drawn a dog , I do not think . ami_da_4
C 653.23 I am tempted to draw a snail because I draw them sometimes and they are really easy to draw . ami_da_4
C 659.14 , right ami_da_2
C 659.14 it is going to be a really funny dog , because I am not sure how to draw a dog . ami_da_4
A 660.96 I forget her name . ami_da_5
D 662.2 Tara or Tara . ami_da_4
B 667.34 Well there are loads of different types of dogs , so I am sure it will represent one kind of dog . ami_da_9
C 671.46 It is a cartoon dog I think . ami_da_4
C 674.44 A s I do not ev ami_da_3
C 674.44 Oh , oh well . ami_da_16
C 678.57 It is a scary cartoon dog . ami_da_4
C 684.11 That This , ami_da_2
C 684.11 that does not look like a dog . ami_da_9
A 687.74 It looks kind of like a person . ami_da_9
C 688.01 I am sorry . ami_da_14
B 688.35 We can pretend . ami_da_6
D 691.11 That is Pinocchio . ami_da_9
C 694.74 How do you draw a dog ? ami_da_5
C 694.74 I suppose it has a lon ami_da_3
C 694.74 Oh my god . ami_da_16
C 698.92 Right . ami_da_2
C 699.81 Yous know what it is supposed to be . ami_da_4
C 704.0 It is a dog . ami_da_4
B 707.3 Okay . ami_da_1
C 707.64 , I like dogs because , , they are so good to humans , like they can be trained to be police dogs and seeing eye dogs , and they are just such friendly animals . ami_da_4
C 719.75 And , like they are more of a companion than cats . ami_da_4
C 724.57 I have nothing against cats . ami_da_4
B 724.64 Yeah , that is true . ami_da_9
C 725.74 Cats do not really like me , so I ca not like them . ami_da_4
C 729.58 But they are just so friendly and warm and nice animals , that do not look like that . ami_da_4
D 745.9 Alrighty . ami_da_16
D 747.5 I feel like a robot . ami_da_4
D 750.03 Okay . ami_da_2
D 751.61 well I guess I had the most time to think about it . ami_da_4
D 753.82 I am going to draw a butterfly , ami_da_7
D 753.82 because I saw a butterfly yesterday , that seemed to be like the symbol of Spring arriving . ami_da_4
D 760.12 And it was actually the prettiest butterfly I have ever seen out in the wild , and I though that was pretty cool in Scotland . ami_da_4
D 763.62 It was like , well it was a little pointier than that . ami_da_4
D 770.77 At first I thought it was a dead leaf . ami_da_4
D 772.73 And then it landed on the wall next to me . ami_da_4
D 775.08 But this part was all brown and then it has these big blue dots like this . ami_da_4
D 780.22 And then it kind of ami_da_2
D 780.22 there was a green , I think it was a green ring , and there was like red going out like this . ami_da_4
A 785.27 It is kind of like a peacock . ami_da_9
D 787.07 Yeah , it kind of was actually , ami_da_9
D 787.07 because it was ami_da_2
D 787.07 This part of the body was really dull , and then it was the most colourful exotic butterfly ever , and I am like , wow this is the middle of Scotland in like March . ami_da_4
D 795.78 So I thought that was pretty cool . ami_da_4
D 796.89 And it landed by a wall and let me look at it for about two minutes . ami_da_4
D 799.18 I wish I would had my camera . ami_da_4
D 800.74 So that is going to be my favourite animal because after all the snow it seemed to say that like Spring is finally here . ami_da_4
D 806.64 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 807.08 There you go . ami_da_16
B 807.2 Very nice . ami_da_9
A 808.49 Great . ami_da_9
D 809.82 , what do we ami_da_3
D 809.82 Oh . ami_da_16
A 816.86 Do you hear the eraser buzzing while you do that ? ami_da_5
A 816.86 Yea ami_da_9
A 816.86 Right . ami_da_2
D 819.44 Yes I do . ami_da_5
A 826.78 So , now that we know how to use the whiteboard , ami_da_4
A 826.78 , the next , , thing we need to address is our financial department , to meet our our budget , ami_da_6
A 826.78 or not meet our budget but more , , like what kind of , , selling range we will be looking at , , want to make this selling price of twenty five Euros . ami_da_4
B 830.07 Okay . ami_da_1
A 854.49 And so we have to , , come up with a way to , to create a , a remote control , where we can like the price to create it will be significantly less . ami_da_6
A 868.47 , we would like to , to , , make fifty million Euro . ami_da_4
A 874.1 I am assuming that is what the M means . ami_da_4
A 876.18 , and make it for an international market . ami_da_4
A 880.41 , one thing we would have to think about internationally is in the design of , , like different kinds of , , VCRs . ami_da_6
A 887.66 Things like that , depending on which country you are . ami_da_4
A 890.1 Another thing for the design team to think about . ami_da_4
A 892.61 , we want it to cost , , absolute maximum of twelve Euro and fifty cents . ami_da_4
D 904.42 Okay , ami_da_9
D 904.42 so we will have a hundred percent profit then ? ami_da_5
D 904.42 Twelve fifty . ami_da_16
A 910.25 I am bad at math . ami_da_4
D 911.3 Okay . ami_da_9
A 911.86 Okay . ami_da_2
A 913.63 so now that , , that is underway , it is discussion time . ami_da_4
A 922.9 So this is time for us to bring our initial ideas , any suggestions that you may have so far , a your personal experiences with remote controls , and , , areas you see that , , could be improved in your experience with them . ami_da_4
A 942.51 Does anyone have any initial thoughts ? ami_da_8
D 945.66 I find that in the dark it is often hard to know what button you are pushing . ami_da_4
A 950.23 So what is something we could , , do to remedy that ? ami_da_8
A 950.23 Yeah . ami_da_9
B 953.97 Okay . ami_da_3
B 956.17 I always find that in our house the remote control always goes missing . ami_da_4
B 961.07 It is always , where is the remote control ? ami_da_4
B 961.07 So maybe if you could have some kind of tracking device for the remote control or some signal that you could find out where it was . ami_da_6
C 962.04 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 972.53 I dunno , ami_da_4
B 972.53 some kind of alarm . ami_da_6
B 974.59 You can press a button on your wall , signal , ami_da_6
B 974.59 because it always gets lost . ami_da_4
A 976.75 It is a great idea . ami_da_9
A 977.9 It is a great idea . ami_da_9
C 981.38 Do yous not find that , , like , there is a lot of , , buttons on your remote control , and you do not know what half of them do . ami_da_5
B 987.57 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 988.84 Yeah , that you do not use half of them . ami_da_9
C 990.08 Yeah , I do not know what they do . ami_da_4
D 996.96 There is some remote controls where there is kind of a hidden panel , so all those buttons that you do not really use unless you are programming or something . ami_da_4
C 1000.87 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 1001.37 Yeah , ami_da_1
B 1001.37 that is , that is ami_da_3
B 1001.37 Yeah , it is . ami_da_9
D 1002.72 That is useful . ami_da_9
D 1004.26 So you just have like the number buttons , power button , TV video button . ami_da_4
B 1004.32 Yeah . ami_da_9
C 1006.94 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 1008.12 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 1010.23 Alright . ami_da_2
A 1010.81 Anything about , , the look of the , , remote control that you might have ideas about . ami_da_8
A 1017.39 Maybe it could be , instead of like a standard rectangular shape , it could be , , something more interesting like ami_da_6
A 1017.39 Any ideas will do that you have at this point . ami_da_4
D 1028.57 Could be shaped like a conch , ami_da_6
D 1028.57 you know . ami_da_16
D 1032.07 Be like a shell shaped remote . ami_da_6
A 1034.15 Can hold it . ami_da_9
B 1034.16 A novelty . ami_da_9
B 1035.34 Are we going into kind of novelty factors here . ami_da_11
A 1035.62 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 1037.67 Like , I have seen phones like a ami_da_3
B 1037.67 Okay . ami_da_9
A 1038.47 Well if it is a trendy original , , aspect we are going for . ami_da_9
A 1042.05 I mean , you are the designers , ami_da_6
A 1042.05 you c , you can decide what kind of , , direction you want to go in , ami_da_6
A 1042.05 but at this point in the , in the first meeting it can be any ideas that we just throw out there . ami_da_4
B 1043.23 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 1044.99 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 1050.27 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 1052.32 I suppose , if we are he heading to have it , like make a huge profit out of this , it needs to be quite a universally accepted thing . ami_da_6
B 1060.25 Like , a novelty thing might only sell a few things rather than , like , a general kind of more acceptable ami_da_4
B 1060.25 But we do not want to go towards boring , because that would not sell either . ami_da_6
B 1071.29 So , . ami_da_2
A 1071.35 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 1072.7 And the key issue here is , is being trendy and original . ami_da_4
B 1075.68 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 1075.84 , that does not necessarily mean it needs to be outrageous . ami_da_4
B 1079.24 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 1080.39 Right . ami_da_2
A 1081.01 Okay we have five minutes left . ami_da_4
A 1083.21 So , just to cover ami_da_3
A 1083.21 We have one more thing . ami_da_4
A 1089.28 , like you can go over your ideas , of course , in your own personal times . ami_da_6
B 1092.94 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 1092.95 , our next meeting will be in half an hour . ami_da_4
A 1095.76 So you have half an hour to , , think about what you want to present . ami_da_6
A 1099.87 Or not present but bring to the meeting . ami_da_4
A 1102.67 , ID , whatever that stands for . ami_da_5
D 1106.35 Interface ? ami_da_5
D 1106.35 Oh , industrial . ami_da_12
B 1106.42 Industrial Designer . ami_da_4
A 1107.36 Industrial Designer . ami_da_12
B 1107.53 That is me . ami_da_4
A 1108.22 I have to remember these things . ami_da_7
A 1111.67 You will be beginning your , your working design . ami_da_6
A 1114.43 , UID the technical functions design will , will be worked on the next thirty minutes . ami_da_6
A 1119.66 , maybe how this can be achieved , and , , we need the user requirements from the manag ami_da_4
A 1119.66 Marketing Expert . ami_da_12
A 1131.17 , you will get specific instructions , , of what to do in the next half an hour . ami_da_4
A 1136.51 And I will see you in half an hour , ami_da_4
A 1136.51 okay ? ami_da_11
B 1138.77 Okay . ami_da_9
