A 211.0 Okay , ami_da_2
A 211.0 welcome everyone to our next meeting . ami_da_14
A 213.98 I am busy writing and busy leading the meeting , but I have prepared a little presentation once again or at least an agenda ami_da_4
A 213.98 I think the biggest part of the presentation will be on your side . ami_da_4
A 231.73 we are here at the conceptual design meeting , which is hereby opened . ami_da_4
A 236.96 once again I will try to write some minutes ami_da_4
A 236.96 which I just from the previous meeting placed inside our project folder , which was quite some typing . ami_da_4
A 247.56 today we once again have three presentations , if I am right , and after that we will take a decision on the remote control concepts . ami_da_4
A 257.06 And just as the last time we have forty minutes to accomplish that . ami_da_4
A 262.18 Okay , well ami_da_2
A 262.18 I would say let is start with the first presentation . ami_da_6
D 266.98 Okay . ami_da_1
A 268.32 in the same order as last time ? ami_da_11
A 268.32 Okay . ami_da_9
C 270.15 W ami_da_3
C 270.15 sure . ami_da_9
B 271.4 Alright . ami_da_9
A 272.83 Well , ami_da_2
A 272.83 take it away . ami_da_6
C 281.68 Okay ami_da_2
C 281.68 welcome you all . ami_da_14
C 284.3 Components design , first of all I would like to accommodate some of those things I elaborate some of the things I did . ami_da_7
C 294.55 I I elaborated on the concept . ami_da_4
C 296.38 What should be said about the components , its properties and what kind of materials should we use to to make one of those r remote controls . ami_da_4
C 310.24 well ami_da_2
C 310.24 first of all I have d subtracted some of the components that is that are used are w w you know from what the remote control is formed . ami_da_4
C 321.53 first of all , the case , the case , the surrounding of the of the the remote control . ami_da_7
C 327.45 I would like to give you an idea of how I thought about . ami_da_7
D 332.4 Do not destroy my giraffe . ami_da_6
C 334.15 Giraffe is gone now . ami_da_4
C 335.74 Okay ami_da_2
C 335.74 the case was is made from rubber , I suppose . ami_da_6
C 338.77 There is one of the because when you use a remote control a lot of people will will drop their remote control and they break ami_da_4
C 338.77 becau ami_da_3
C 338.77 the titanium was also an option . ami_da_4
D 346.73 Drop it . ami_da_4
C 352.48 But it is a very expensive material . ami_da_9
C 354.87 rubber is , I think , the best suitable material to use for our for our remote control . ami_da_9
C 364.05 it is poss it is also possible to create fancy colours with rubber . ami_da_4
C 369.86 rubber l makes it easy to to to it lets lets itself colour . ami_da_4
C 374.8 titanium you have to paint it and with that it is possible to scratch it ami_da_4
C 374.8 or ami_da_4
C 374.8 yeah make it ugly . ami_da_4
C 383.76 rubber the total piece of rubber that is sor that is that is used to make the case is the same colour , so if you scratch it it is still the same colour , perhaps it is a little bit damaged . ami_da_4
C 396.36 But it is a very strong material . ami_da_9
C 398.38 I h I had an idea single covered curved , sorry , single curved . ami_da_6
C 404.51 so ami_da_2
C 404.51 it is t two dimensional . ami_da_4
C 407.17 I think it is it is best to draw ami_da_7
C 407.17 oh ami_da_16
C 407.17 green . ami_da_9
B 411.71 It is a colour . ami_da_9
D 412.81 Bright colour . ami_da_16
C 413.22 New . ami_da_16
D 413.53 Fancy colour . ami_da_16
D 415.01 Forward . ami_da_16
C 415.73 Blank . ami_da_16
C 417.27 Okay . ami_da_9
D 417.37 You have to go t ami_da_3
D 417.37 Oh ami_da_12
D 417.37 it is a side view . ami_da_4
C 420.76 Let is make it black . ami_da_7
C 423.3 Okay . ami_da_9
C 423.81 I thought of an idea like this . ami_da_4
C 426.93 Oh that . ami_da_16
C 429.08 delete . ami_da_16
C 432.73 Blank . ami_da_16
C 434.22 Okay . ami_da_16
C 440.93 So it also looks nice when it is on your table . ami_da_9
C 443.74 So you get ami_da_3
C 443.74 it does not lay flat down on the table , but it is c ami_da_6
C 443.74 it is stands . ami_da_6
C 449.56 Side view ami_da_9
C 449.56 yes it is side view ami_da_9
C 449.56 so ami_da_2
C 449.56 I ami_da_15
C 449.56 I am not technically good at th three D modelling , ami_da_15
C 449.56 but . ami_da_3
C 455.27 it is just an idea I had ami_da_4
C 455.27 so it is it is very ami_da_3
C 455.27 so its also looks nice when it is on the table . ami_da_9
C 462.27 the graphical user interface and the buttons , we also thought about that already . ami_da_4
C 467.76 I thought about the LCD touch screen , ami_da_6
C 467.76 which is is easy to clean too . ami_da_9
C 474.6 One of the great advantages of the LCD screen you just use some or another cleaning cl some cleaning stuff . ami_da_9
C 483.15 And it should be made of strong plastic and it should be bright . ami_da_6
C 488.4 Well ami_da_2
C 488.4 I already s explained some properties of that material ami_da_4
C 488.4 and I think ami_da_3
C 488.4 well ami_da_2
C 488.4 we also we almost concluded about that ami_da_4
C 488.4 this should be our button component . ami_da_6
D 500.1 True . ami_da_9
C 502.69 So ami_da_2
C 502.69 that is all about the buttons . ami_da_4
C 507.47 the batteries , we also thought about that already , ami_da_4
C 507.47 will be chargeable with an option for a mount station ami_da_6
C 507.47 so you can put the the remote control in a mount station so its charges itself up instead of plugging it in or something like that . ami_da_4
C 523.87 Questions , ? ami_da_5
D 524.84 No no no ami_da_4
D 524.84 no no . ami_da_4
B 525.15 No . ami_da_4
D 526.37 Just looking . ami_da_4
C 527.52 And they should be long lasting , not not be empty in about two minutes or thirty minutes or forty minutes of use . ami_da_6
C 535.71 And next step is the chip th the component that is makes or transmits the signal to the television . ami_da_4
C 544.46 there was an option to use s a rather simple chip ami_da_4
C 544.46 but I think because of our highly requiring requirements , there should be an advanced chip in it with also the ability to facilitate speaker speech recognition ami_da_6
C 544.46 which unfortunately is still in a test phase , ami_da_9
C 544.46 so ami_da_2
C 544.46 there should be some more investigation on that side . ami_da_6
C 572.82 my personal preferences ami_da_7
C 572.82 I also overheard in the last meeting that there shou we should use our own business colours . ami_da_4
C 582.2 That was correct , was not it ? ami_da_11
C 582.2 Okay . ami_da_12
C 584.46 I think they are rather boring for for use with rubber . ami_da_9
A 588.5 Well , ami_da_2
A 588.5 business colours I thought it was the the slogan and the corporate image , ami_da_4
A 588.5 so yeah , it needs colour , but I do not think you have to make the entire thing in the corporate colour . ami_da_9
C 594.12 Okay ami_da_2
C 594.12 they should be m sh they should be in mind , ami_da_4
C 594.12 was not it ? ami_da_11
C 594.12 Okay ami_da_12
C 594.12 so it d it does not says to have the slogan ? ami_da_5
C 594.12 Okay okay . ami_da_12
A 602.28 It must be recognisable . ami_da_4
C 604.59 Well ami_da_2
C 604.59 that is possible of course . ami_da_9
C 606.09 We could make a little R and R on the top of the machine . ami_da_6
B 606.55 You can put the R and R . ami_da_6
C 610.79 so ami_da_2
C 610.79 they are pretty boring , ami_da_9
C 610.79 I suggest , because just the availability with rubber to make fantastic colours and also in a lot of possible colours , so it is possible to make very fancy remote controls ami_da_6
C 610.79 which peopl who people in ami_da_3
C 610.79 which people will find they are interesting . ami_da_4
C 631.13 And will buy them faster when they look at the same old grey or black colours . ami_da_4
C 637.92 s as I said before rubber is is impossible to damage severely ami_da_4
C 637.92 imp instead of ami_da_3
C 637.92 of course you can break it when you you when you break it in s for example with a pair of scissors or something like that , but i if you drop it it is not broken right away s instead of using plastic , hard plastic or titanium . ami_da_4
C 660.64 And I personally liked the single curved remote control , ami_da_9
C 660.64 because it yeah ami_da_4
C 660.64 it makes sense . ami_da_4
C 669.14 Okay . ami_da_2
C 670.11 Well ami_da_2
C 670.11 that is all about my my findings . ami_da_4
B 673.55 Alright . ami_da_12
A 674.31 Okay , ami_da_12
A 674.31 thank you . ami_da_14
B 675.91 I will go next . ami_da_7
D 676.36 Next . ami_da_6
B 689.26 Alright ami_da_2
B 689.26 so ami_da_2
B 689.26 I thought a little bit about the interface . ami_da_4
B 691.8 how it should look . ami_da_4
B 694.05 And we determined that will not be no buttons , but only an LCD screen , so I had to look on that . ami_da_4
B 703.33 And the design is therefore based on what we just thought of . ami_da_4
B 709.87 first there are some new findings and new technology for speech recognition . ami_da_7
B 714.68 And this is that you you ask you give a question through through the device and it answers you . ami_da_4
B 722.87 And they already put this in an in a coffee maker . ami_da_4
B 726.43 And so that it you say good morning , coffee maker , and it says t says to you back good morning Joe or what is your name . ami_da_4
B 735.03 This and there is an easy way to program that you say record into the device into the speaker and then you say the question and ami_da_4
B 735.03 three seconds later you say the answer and then when you say the question it gives you the answer . ami_da_4
B 747.87 perhaps it is useful , ami_da_9
B 747.87 perhaps for because people lose the remote , they can yell remote where are you and calls or something . ami_da_4
D 757.01 It is true . ami_da_9
B 757.64 And perhaps we could implement that . ami_da_6
B 760.0 And then I have to go out of the presentation ami_da_7
B 760.0 because I tried to make some kind of a a idea of how it should look like ami_da_4
B 760.0 but I ca not draw , ami_da_15
B 760.0 so ami_da_2
B 760.0 do not make too much of it . ami_da_6
C 763.62 Oh my God . ami_da_16
B 774.12 I tried to the LCD screen I tried to sort of to draw . ami_da_4
B 778.86 I thought at least the icon for the volume . ami_da_4
B 782.43 I do not know if there is an icon for the program , ami_da_8
B 782.43 but ami_da_3
B 782.43 yeah . ami_da_9
C 785.2 Not just a P . ami_da_6
D 785.9 P ami_da_6
D 785.9 yeah , just a P . ami_da_9
B 786.87 So ami_da_2
B 786.87 and then the buttons above and below the and the and the mute button also recognisable as an icon . ami_da_4
D 796.2 Where is where is the button for two ? ami_da_5
D 796.2 Okay . ami_da_12
B 799.4 I forgot that one . ami_da_4
B 800.31 I thought I forgot something , ami_da_4
B 800.31 but . ami_da_3
B 803.7 And and the numbers , ami_da_4
B 803.7 that should be a bit larger ami_da_6
B 803.7 I think it is not really on scale and and so forth . ami_da_4
D 810.48 Does not matter . ami_da_14
B 811.23 an options button . ami_da_4
B 813.41 And I thought the the button for teletext apar apart ami_da_6
B 813.41 because it is not really options , I think . ami_da_4
B 820.13 It is options is the settings of the remote and of the TV and that kind of thing . ami_da_4
D 820.81 No . ami_da_9
C 823.87 Yep . ami_da_9
B 824.26 So could call it settings or something . ami_da_6
B 826.45 But this is a bit how I thought it . ami_da_4
B 829.78 And the LCD somewhere on the remote . ami_da_6
B 832.62 Perhaps we could be more curvy the remote perhaps should , ami_da_6
B 832.62 so that it is better in your hand or something . ami_da_9
C 839.44 Oh okay , ami_da_12
C 839.44 yeah . ami_da_9
B 840.44 But and and a microph microphone for the speech recognition if we want to implement that . ami_da_4
B 846.77 and then if you press the op options button , now we have an example of ami_da_4
B 846.77 and then you should get the other options with what what you could do ami_da_4
B 846.77 and that you could do with something like this this . ami_da_6
C 860.75 Oh yeah , . ami_da_12
B 861.93 And it is also ami_da_4
B 861.93 I thought think we discussed earlier that older people do not really want to use these extra settings . ami_da_4
B 871.32 And older people a also do not really want to use this th this kind of option menus . ami_da_4
B 877.13 So they want to u use one button and then something happens , and not choose with this kind of ami_da_4
B 877.13 And you could put in a an a really s little scrolling device on the side of your remote , ami_da_6
B 877.13 so you could scroll scroll across these things . ami_da_4
C 892.34 Okay . ami_da_12
B 893.2 That is an option . ami_da_4
B 894.8 And that was my finding ami_da_4
B 894.8 dinge . ami_da_3
A 900.77 Thanks . ami_da_14
B 901.71 Yeah . ami_da_16
D 903.25 Okay . ami_da_7
A 904.07 Now our third team member with his presentation . ami_da_4
C 905.71 Go Danny , go Danny . ami_da_16
D 922.9 Okay , ami_da_2
D 922.9 I am going to tell you something about a trend watching . ami_da_7
D 926.53 The trends from the past years , what the people like , what the youngsters like , what the elderly people liked about shapes , colours , material and stuff . ami_da_7
D 936.03 Okay . ami_da_12
D 937.01 The method I used was ami_da_3
D 937.01 Like I told I watched the trends from the past years about colours , shapes , material they wanted from elderly and young people . ami_da_4
D 947.98 So we can keep that in mind for designing f the device itself . ami_da_6
D 953.55 Findings I made . ami_da_7
D 955.7 The most important thing people liked last year was that the remote control should be look look fancy . ami_da_4
D 962.5 The second important thing that w should be if inv in innov innovative , ami_da_4
D 962.5 okay , ami_da_2
D 962.5 like the LCD screen that is quite innovative ami_da_4
D 962.5 so that should be great meeting for this . ami_da_9
D 973.54 And the third thing is it should be easy to use . ami_da_4
D 976.29 I think with only one menu , four button , channel , volume , it should also be enough for easy to use . ami_da_6
D 983.82 The personal preferences for the young people , they liked fruity colours like banana yellow , strawberry red and stuff . ami_da_4
C 988.08 Fruity ? ami_da_12
C 988.08 Fruity . ami_da_1
B 991.47 Grass green . ami_da_5
D 992.34 Yeah . ami_da_4
D 993.18 Like that . ami_da_4
D 994.55 The round shapes , and soft material m materials like the rubber . ami_da_4
D 999.34 It should be soft ami_da_6
D 999.34 i it should feeling spongy or s Sponge Bob like things . ami_da_6
C 999.6 Okay . ami_da_1
B 1005.27 Let is build it into a sponge . ami_da_14
D 1005.43 Th ami_da_3
D 1005.43 Elderly people like au colours which y are being seen in autumn like woods dark brown , red , deep reds and stuff . ami_da_4
D 1017.88 They liked square shapes with round edges . ami_da_4
D 1022.44 And hard materials like wood , titanium . ami_da_4
D 1026.08 They ami_da_3
D 1026.08 those kind of materials they liked . ami_da_4
D 1029.61 This is a bit like the young peoples like the fruity colours , innovative , all the colours you see , the blue , the red , the white , the yellow , that stuff . ami_da_4
D 1039.64 And then I th ami_da_6
D 1039.64 I ami_da_6
D 1039.64 I personally thought the front side of the shape should be something for the youngsters like like this or something . ami_da_6
A 1046.07 Oh ami_da_12
A 1046.07 y ami_da_3
A 1046.07 So for the older people , a more traditional form . ami_da_5
D 1052.04 It is it is a bit like a banana . ami_da_4
D 1054.44 And the colour should be yellow , or something . ami_da_6
D 1056.71 And for the elderly people just plain old . ami_da_6
D 1060.04 Because we decided to have two kind of remotes , two designs , ami_da_4
D 1060.04 or was it two colours ? ami_da_5
D 1060.04 Different colours , yeah . ami_da_12
B 1065.29 It was one remote , I think , ami_da_9
B 1065.29 different colours . ami_da_4
D 1067.15 We should decide whether it is going to be with round shapes . ami_da_6
D 1069.86 I think like my colleague , you said , is that is e better , or for the elderly people something like like the iPod or something , with round squares . ami_da_6
D 1081.37 Simple but easy to use . ami_da_9
D 1086.14 So that is it . ami_da_4
C 1087.25 Okay . ami_da_9
D 1087.54 That is my ami_da_3
D 1087.54 Yeah , ami_da_4
D 1087.54 like the older o older colours I can maybe ami_da_3
D 1087.54 Yeah . ami_da_9
B 1094.34 You could you could change the colours , that was also the idea . ami_da_6
B 1098.56 I do not know which shape you should should take , ami_da_9
B 1098.56 but . ami_da_3
D 1100.89 Colours th the elderly people ami_da_16
D 1100.89 Look something like that . ami_da_4
A 1102.21 Yeah , ami_da_2
A 1102.21 I guess changing colours will be easier than changing the shape of it . ami_da_9
B 1104.34 Yeah . ami_da_9
C 1104.44 Changing just the shape of the remote control ? ami_da_5
C 1104.44 Yeah , ami_da_9
C 1104.44 s ami_da_3
C 1104.44 round corners , but s but square , yeah . ami_da_9
B 1107.09 Perhaps you could find something in the middle . ami_da_6
B 1109.22 Round but square . ami_da_6
B 1112.41 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 1112.77 But maybe then both groups wo not buy it . ami_da_4
C 1114.8 Yeah . ami_da_16
B 1115.99 i i if you do it square , with round corners but a little in the middle of it ami_da_6
B 1115.99 i ami_da_3
B 1115.99 Do you know what I mean ? ami_da_13
B 1115.99 wait , like like this a bit . ami_da_6
C 1124.7 Yeah I know what you mean , ami_da_12
C 1124.7 kind of like a . ami_da_3
C 1135.86 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 1138.02 So it is a bit square , but it is also a bit round . ami_da_4
C 1141.49 Kinda like a beer glass . ami_da_4
B 1144.23 So ami_da_2
B 1144.23 but then Same sides . ami_da_6
C 1144.48 Yeah . ami_da_4
C 1145.89 I know what you mean . ami_da_12
C 1150.77 It is also easy to to have to to put in your hand . ami_da_9
B 1151.23 But that is ami_da_3
B 1151.23 Yeah ami_da_9
B 1151.23 but that is also how other remotes are shaped , ami_da_4
B 1151.23 so that is ami_da_3
B 1151.23 But perhaps that is a good thing , so that is easy to use . ami_da_9
C 1157.67 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 1160.0 People know the ami_da_4
B 1160.0 Yeah . ami_da_9
C 1160.8 Will recognise that is as a remote control . ami_da_4
C 1163.2 when I saw your d ami_da_3
C 1163.2 Oh . ami_da_16
D 1167.98 Autumn colours like red , brown . ami_da_4
D 1171.0 They liked the wood a lot . ami_da_4
C 1171.55 Huh . ami_da_1
D 1172.48 So maybe we could give it like wooden loo look look or something in that colour . ami_da_6
B 1172.89 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 1176.1 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 1176.3 Yeah , ami_da_2
C 1176.3 kind of like old cars , ami_da_4
C 1176.3 Let is put it all together . ami_da_6
D 1177.62 And a bit bit old school style renaissance , medieval kind of things . ami_da_6
B 1178.34 Yeah . ami_da_9
B 1184.94 Swords . ami_da_5
D 1185.11 Those kind of ami_da_3
D 1185.11 Yeah , those kind of things . ami_da_4
D 1187.75 So you see the big difference ami_da_5
D 1187.75 between the young people ? ami_da_9
D 1187.75 Fresh , exciting . ami_da_9
B 1189.81 Yeah . ami_da_4
D 1192.0 And the old people , old and boring . ami_da_9
B 1193.06 But that is easily to do with the colour , I think . ami_da_9
D 1195.42 So ami_da_2
D 1195.42 Sorry ? ami_da_12
D 1195.42 Yeah I think it is it is easier to do in colour than in shape . ami_da_9
B 1196.24 That is easy to do with the colours , I think . ami_da_4
B 1200.2 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 1200.78 Because otherwise we have to get different shapes , ami_da_4
D 1200.78 and colour way easier than yeah ami_da_9
D 1200.78 the shapes . ami_da_9
A 1200.99 Yeah we think so too . ami_da_9
D 1207.08 In material ami_da_3
D 1207.08 yeah ami_da_3
D 1207.08 rubber , rubber is , ami_da_3
D 1207.08 like I said , young people like more soft materials and spongy ones and the old people like plain wood . ami_da_4
B 1216.84 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 1216.93 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 1217.48 So we have to decide if we are going to use real hard rubber , or soft rubber . ami_da_8
B 1224.04 Yeah ami_da_2
B 1224.04 think ami_da_3
B 1224.04 Also in between . ami_da_6
D 1224.06 Or something something between that . ami_da_8
C 1226.5 Soft rubber . ami_da_12
D 1227.35 Yeah soft rubber which you can you can feel in it . ami_da_4
C 1231.01 Yeah I know what you . ami_da_12
B 1232.39 I do not think you should be able to mould it , ami_da_6
B 1232.39 but ami_da_3
B 1232.39 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 1233.21 Or ami_da_3
D 1233.21 No . ami_da_9
D 1234.77 Or or wh ami_da_3
D 1234.77 what is something harder . ami_da_5
C 1234.95 It should should not be . ami_da_3
D 1236.67 No no no ami_da_2
D 1236.67 but but you have to ami_da_3
D 1236.67 like like like a a eraser or something . ami_da_6
D 1242.56 That is the bit you can press it in , or something harder . ami_da_6
B 1247.68 Bit like this kind of rubber . ami_da_5
B 1249.35 This ami_da_3
B 1249.35 But it is quite hard , this . ami_da_4
D 1249.93 Yeah , something like this , yeah . ami_da_4
D 1253.6 Yeah it is quite hard ami_da_9
D 1253.6 but you can press it in . ami_da_4
B 1254.98 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 1255.02 It is feels kind s spongy . ami_da_4
C 1257.83 Spongy . ami_da_1
D 1260.64 Something . ami_da_3
B 1262.67 I do not think it is rubber . ami_da_4
D 1263.1 No . ami_da_9
D 1265.41 N n n ami_da_3
D 1265.41 Are you going to invite Sponge Bob , ami_da_14
D 1265.41 maybe he can ami_da_14
D 1265.41 Yeah I think that is the better thing to do . ami_da_9
A 1266.88 So we need a spongy feeling . ami_da_4
B 1269.07 did you have something about ami_da_3
B 1269.07 So we should first decide about shape , I think . ami_da_6
C 1270.93 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 1273.84 Ding ding . ami_da_16
B 1276.41 Which ami_da_3
B 1276.41 Then you can fit the LCD screen in it , and can decide . ami_da_6
C 1284.49 I also s ca not help but notice that you used an you had a remote control and the LCD screen was rather small . ami_da_4
D 1295.81 Yeah ami_da_9
D 1295.81 w I think that LCD screen should be like ami_da_3
D 1295.81 Yeah ami_da_9
D 1295.81 three quarter of the of the ami_da_6
D 1295.81 Yeah ami_da_2
D 1295.81 the buttons wo not get that small when the LCD screen is ami_da_4
B 1296.44 Yeah ami_da_9
B 1296.44 it it is supposed to be bit s bit s bit ami_da_3
B 1296.44 Yeah . ami_da_9
C 1299.32 This was your size , ami_da_4
C 1299.32 but I think it should be larger . ami_da_6
C 1303.44 Yeah , three quarters . ami_da_9
C 1304.69 So so you do not have to put your oh . ami_da_3
C 1309.11 new , blank . ami_da_16
C 1312.54 So ami_da_2
C 1312.54 when you get this ami_da_3
C 1312.54 kind of like this . ami_da_11
B 1321.87 Ooh ami_da_9
B 1321.87 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 1327.0 Or should it be larger ? ami_da_11
C 1327.0 Larger ? ami_da_11
C 1327.0 Because you want to put your hands ami_da_4
C 1327.0 You want ami_da_3
C 1327.0 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 1328.26 Larger I think . ami_da_9
B 1331.12 But if you pu ami_da_3
B 1331.12 Now you can put your hand there and then you wo not touch the screen . ami_da_4
D 1331.27 Yeah ami_da_2
D 1331.27 becau because you have ami_da_3
D 1331.27 Yeah okay , true , true , true true . ami_da_9
B 1335.56 Perhaps that is best . ami_da_9
C 1337.59 Your thumb here . ami_da_4
B 1339.57 But not on the screen because ami_da_3
B 1339.57 Yeah ami_da_9
B 1339.57 that is that is an idea . ami_da_4
C 1341.6 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 1342.82 Yeah . ami_da_9
B 1345.42 Looks a bit like a Game Boy now . ami_da_4
C 1345.64 Because when you put your f ami_da_3
C 1345.64 Yeah ami_da_2
C 1345.64 but if yo if you make the the LCD screen as large as the remote control itself , you will you will always get some ami_da_4
C 1345.64 You ami_da_3
C 1345.64 Yeah . ami_da_9
B 1354.14 You always touch it , ami_da_4
B 1354.14 yeah . ami_da_9
D 1354.98 Yeah ami_da_9
D 1354.98 yeah ami_da_9
D 1354.98 yeah ami_da_9
D 1354.98 yeah . ami_da_9
C 1355.66 Going to be very greasy and stuff . ami_da_9
D 1357.43 But it wo not get that small ami_da_6
D 1357.43 because you have how much ? ami_da_4
D 1357.43 Nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen buttons on the screen . ami_da_4
B 1363.04 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 1364.63 One to zero , the two digit , ami_da_4
D 1364.63 You have to you have to ami_da_3
D 1364.63 Because some fat people with d thick fingers will press three buttons at same time . ami_da_4
C 1365.55 Yeah you do not want it too small . ami_da_12
C 1366.7 How yeah how large ami_da_8
C 1366.7 Yeah they have thick fingers . ami_da_9
C 1374.55 But if you want to make it in international , ami_da_3
C 1374.55 Japanese people got rather small hands ami_da_4
C 1374.55 and we got these large ami_da_3
C 1374.55 Zoom opt ami_da_12
C 1374.55 yeah of course , ami_da_12
C 1374.55 yeah . ami_da_9
D 1378.44 Yeah true , ami_da_9
D 1378.44 but ami_da_3
D 1378.44 Yeah , ami_da_2
D 1378.44 we have we have the zoom option , ami_da_6
D 1378.44 right ? ami_da_11
D 1378.44 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 1383.67 You can make it larger to to to with accompanying greater fields to push the button . ami_da_6
A 1389.2 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 1389.54 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 1389.96 And we wo not include a a pen , or something to point , ami_da_6
A 1389.96 hey , ami_da_11
A 1389.96 we we want to do it with our fingers , ami_da_6
A 1389.96 right ? ami_da_11
A 1389.96 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 1392.59 No . ami_da_9
D 1394.23 Yeah . ami_da_9
C 1394.58 Your fingers , yeah . ami_da_9
D 1395.15 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 1395.4 You do not want ami_da_3
C 1395.4 Because if you lose the pen if you lose the pen you ca not use ami_da_4
C 1395.4 Yeah ami_da_2
C 1395.4 You can do whatever any cloth . ami_da_9
B 1395.85 Y you could include a pen ami_da_9
D 1396.49 Use a pen You you c ami_da_3
D 1396.49 you can lose the pen . ami_da_4
A 1398.15 Yeah ami_da_2
A 1398.15 but I think people want to use a remote with with their fingers because th they are used to that ami_da_4
A 1398.15 and ami_da_3
A 1398.15 And maybe we have to add a tissue to remove the grease from all the fingers , huh . ami_da_6
D 1400.39 Yeah ami_da_9
D 1400.39 the fingers , yeah . ami_da_9
B 1400.92 Yeah o ami_da_16
B 1400.92 yeah , if they think it is handy to use a pen . ami_da_16
B 1406.2 Yeah ami_da_2
B 1406.2 I think this this is a good size for the screen . ami_da_9
B 1408.96 I do not know how how large the actual remote should be ami_da_8
B 1408.96 but a little bit like this , or something . ami_da_6
B 1417.13 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 1417.68 Yeah ami_da_2
D 1417.68 but that that can be with plain soft tissue . ami_da_9
D 1421.08 Yeah , ami_da_9
D 1421.08 you can buy those at ami_da_3
D 1421.08 Maybe it is better to to include rechargeable batteries which you can recharge through the docking station . ami_da_6
A 1421.96 Okay well ami_da_2
A 1421.96 maybe , if I can interrupt you , ami_da_11
A 1421.96 maybe I should should show some points on which we should take a decision . ami_da_7
C 1429.94 Sure . ami_da_9
A 1430.63 So we can discuss these points . ami_da_6
A 1434.97 those points energy question mark . ami_da_4
A 1438.96 How how should we supply the thing with energy ami_da_8
A 1438.96 and how ami_da_3
A 1438.96 are we going to do it with separate docking station and then put in it . ami_da_11
A 1446.66 chip on print and case . ami_da_4
A 1448.47 Those are points my coach advised me to discuss here , ami_da_4
A 1448.47 but I hope you have ideas about them . ami_da_8
B 1455.92 I think energy were batteries ami_da_6
B 1455.92 and then and ami_da_3
B 1455.92 Yeah . ami_da_9
C 1458.77 The docking station . ami_da_9
A 1461.26 Yeah . ami_da_11
A 1461.56 So that is the the the first point . ami_da_4
A 1462.94 We already decided that on the previous meeting . ami_da_4
C 1463.93 W ami_da_3
C 1463.93 Yeah . ami_da_2
B 1465.54 Yeah . ami_da_9
B 1466.96 Yeah . ami_da_9
B 1468.76 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 1469.01 So ami_da_2
D 1469.01 if the badg the batteries are dead then you can re you can change them . ami_da_4
B 1469.51 Just like with the telephone . ami_da_4
C 1471.66 I kind of like your ami_da_3
C 1471.66 Yeah ami_da_2
C 1471.66 you got some some of those wireless mice ? ami_da_5
C 1471.66 Mouse . ami_da_5
D 1479.52 Yeah ami_da_4
D 1479.52 yeah ami_da_4
D 1479.52 yeah ami_da_4
D 1479.52 like those . ami_da_4
C 1480.48 Computer mouse . ami_da_5
C 1482.55 Kinda like those kind of batteries . ami_da_6
D 1483.98 Yep . ami_da_9
B 1485.23 but it should be th ami_da_6
B 1485.23 I think normal batteries , ami_da_6
B 1485.23 not not like two or two ami_da_3
B 1485.23 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 1487.08 Yeah , normal plain ami_da_9
D 1487.08 you ami_da_3
D 1487.08 No ami_da_2
D 1487.08 normal plain batteries you can buy at the supermarket or retail shop . ami_da_9
C 1491.8 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 1492.22 Simple rechargeable batteries . ami_da_9
D 1493.18 Yeah . ami_da_9
B 1493.49 Yeah . ami_da_9
B 1498.97 what was with the chip on print ? ami_da_5
B 1498.97 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 1501.88 The chip on print ? ami_da_12
C 1501.88 you gotta f ami_da_3
C 1501.88 Yeah . ami_da_2
C 1506.8 I think so . ami_da_16
C 1507.55 Chip on print with a with a simple a sim not a simple but a ami_da_3
C 1507.55 We also discussed that . ami_da_4
D 1510.06 Print plate . ami_da_4
C 1515.44 Did not we ? ami_da_5
C 1515.44 Beg your pardon ? ami_da_12
C 1515.44 Yeah sure , of course ami_da_9
C 1515.44 , yeah . ami_da_9
A 1516.9 Yeah ami_da_2
A 1516.9 but how did this how does that with a LCD screen ? ami_da_5
A 1516.9 You still have a print plate . ami_da_4
D 1524.34 Yeah ami_da_9
D 1524.34 yeah ami_da_9
D 1524.34 yeah . ami_da_9
D 1524.87 You always have a print plate . ami_da_4
D 1527.97 You always have a print plate , ami_da_4
D 1527.97 right ? ami_da_11
D 1527.97 Always , ami_da_4
D 1527.97 so ami_da_2
D 1527.97 I dunno what w what we have to decide about that . ami_da_5
A 1535.73 Yeah well ami_da_2
A 1535.73 it is a good question . ami_da_4
A 1537.59 It just was in there ami_da_4
A 1537.59 and I did not have any information about it , ami_da_4
A 1537.59 but ami_da_3
C 1538.77 Well ami_da_2
C 1538.77 chip on print , I think what they mean with the regular rubber buttons that you got , it is always clear for the remote control when you press a certain button . ami_da_4
C 1548.72 But when you got a LCD screen , with no with not the buttons are not always on the same place , for example if you enlarge a button , or if you got several options appearing on your screen , the co ordinations are not always the same . ami_da_4
D 1550.53 Yeah , okay . ami_da_1
D 1553.97 But ami_da_3
D 1553.97 Yeah okay , ami_da_9
D 1553.97 but the p print plate of L LCD screen is more advanced than a normal print plate , so that that is not of any discussion , I think . ami_da_4
C 1564.41 When you got a regular button , th the button of stand by is always on the same place ami_da_4
C 1564.41 and you got on the and on the ami_da_3
C 1564.41 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 1577.59 Well ami_da_2
A 1577.59 you need some kind of CPU , I guess . ami_da_9
C 1579.67 I suppose so . ami_da_9
D 1579.81 , I do not I dunno ami_da_9
D 1579.81 I do not think that is ami_da_9
D 1579.81 Yeah ami_da_9
D 1579.81 yeah ami_da_9
D 1579.81 okay ami_da_9
D 1579.81 but I d ami_da_3
D 1579.81 I ami_da_3
D 1579.81 I do not know if nor o s it is quite a simple LCD . ami_da_3
C 1582.64 It is a simple CPU ami_da_4
C 1582.64 but it does not ami_da_3
C 1582.64 Yeah ami_da_2
C 1582.64 because it has to b ami_da_3
C 1582.64 Yeah ami_da_2
C 1582.64 but it the the remote control has to know whether you are in a settings menu or just you just want to turn up the volume . ami_da_4
D 1589.8 Yeah , it is quite a simple LCD screen . ami_da_9
D 1591.76 I think they do not need that big of CPU . ami_da_4
D 1600.04 Yeah , okay , true true . ami_da_9
D 1603.19 True . ami_da_9
C 1605.39 So it has to have some kind of a calculation unit or CPU to know in which state you are and which button you are pressing in at the right moment . ami_da_4
A 1617.97 Because we are projecting projecting the buttons on the LCD screen . ami_da_4
C 1621.11 Yeah . ami_da_9
C 1624.15 And a touch screen makes it possible to to get the co ordination of your finger on the screen . ami_da_4
A 1629.07 Yeah . ami_da_9
C 1630.61 And the case , yeah we already discussed the case , we wanted to make it from rubber ami_da_4
C 1630.61 and ami_da_3
C 1630.61 hard rubber I think . ami_da_9
B 1631.82 It is rubber . ami_da_4
B 1633.51 Yeah ami_da_9
B 1633.51 but but a hard rubber like this ? ami_da_11
B 1633.51 Or softer rubber ami_da_11
B 1633.51 or ami_da_3
B 1633.51 Yeah . ami_da_9
C 1637.59 That is the easy to ha to to ami_da_3
C 1637.59 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 1639.36 Yeah . ami_da_9
B 1639.89 It bounces back from the floor where you throw it . ami_da_4
C 1642.29 Yeah sure , ami_da_9
C 1642.29 look . ami_da_16
D 1642.48 We have different colours . ami_da_4
B 1643.84 Yeah yeah ami_da_2
B 1643.84 this in different colours ? ami_da_12
B 1643.84 Yeah it is a bit . ami_da_9
D 1645.84 So ami_da_2
D 1645.84 the shapes is something between the square shapes with round colo corners and a round shapes ? ami_da_11
D 1645.84 No I do not think , ami_da_9
D 1645.84 I think it is more round than square . ami_da_4
C 1646.31 D ami_da_3
C 1646.31 It is our main target . ami_da_9
B 1659.97 But I think it should be a bit longer , perhaps . ami_da_6
D 1660.2 So it meets ami_da_3
D 1660.2 I think it meets more the young people than the older people . ami_da_4
B 1664.5 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 1664.72 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 1664.95 But that is what we want , . ami_da_5
B 1665.05 I think so too . ami_da_9
D 1666.37 Yeah , that is our target . ami_da_4
D 1667.93 Yeah . ami_da_4
B 1668.1 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 1669.3 Lower than forty years , I think it was . ami_da_4
C 1673.2 Well ami_da_2
C 1673.2 and how about my idea of making it with one single curve ? ami_da_11
C 1673.2 So i ami_da_3
C 1673.2 Because it is a gadget and you want to show it off , of course . ami_da_4
D 1680.39 Oh yeah ami_da_16
D 1680.39 that that I think ami_da_3
D 1680.39 I thought that was a quite good ami_da_9
D 1680.39 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 1682.31 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 1686.76 Yeah ami_da_9
A 1686.76 yeah you have a fancy design , then , right away . ami_da_9
B 1687.25 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 1689.12 You can put it on your table with the LCD screen , you do not have to put it get it in your hand , you can put it next to you and then dive it in ami_da_6
D 1689.12 and . ami_da_3
A 1689.31 So ami_da_3
A 1689.31 Okay so ami_da_2
A 1689.31 Yeah ami_da_9
A 1689.31 but I wrote it down . ami_da_4
C 1689.52 Because it ami_da_3
C 1689.52 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 1694.98 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 1696.25 Yeah , that is a good idea . ami_da_9
C 1697.51 It is a lot easier . ami_da_9
D 1698.16 Yeah . ami_da_3
B 1698.44 Yeah , alright . ami_da_9
D 1701.34 So ami_da_2
D 1701.34 You ca not you You ca not ami_da_3
D 1701.34 oh , ami_da_2
D 1701.34 you c you can draw it on your paper and then load it on the And load it on the the user the server . ami_da_6
C 1701.75 So , so ami_da_2
C 1701.75 you got ami_da_3
C 1701.75 Did you write that down ? ami_da_5
C 1701.75 got a single curved rubber f fancy coloured remote control . ami_da_4
B 1703.08 And then ami_da_3
B 1703.08 Yeah , you can It is pretty easy ami_da_9
B 1703.08 but And ami_da_3
B 1703.08 Yeah , ami_da_9
B 1703.08 I had what I just ami_da_3
B 1703.08 I should again . ami_da_7
C 1715.17 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 1726.62 What about the user interface , ami_da_8
A 1726.62 there are also some some questions about the concepts I think you have some ideas on that . ami_da_4
A 1733.49 You you showed your drawing . ami_da_4
B 1740.64 I miss a few buttons , ami_da_4
B 1740.64 but . ami_da_3
B 1744.89 Well . ami_da_2
B 1747.3 At least ami_da_3
B 1747.3 what we should also have on , I just remembered , a menu to go back through the first ami_da_6
B 1747.3 if if you touch options , you ca not go back to this right away now . ami_da_4
D 1756.81 Yeah , ami_da_12
D 1756.81 you have to go back . ami_da_4
D 1758.5 Yeah . ami_da_9
B 1759.87 This ami_da_3
B 1759.87 I do not know . ami_da_9
D 1760.87 Is not it better to have the sound and the general buttons horizontal ? ami_da_11
D 1760.87 With the minus and the plus . ami_da_11
B 1769.02 I think it is ami_da_3
B 1769.02 I do not know . ami_da_9
D 1769.42 I think it is easier than ami_da_9
D 1769.42 Yeah . ami_da_11
B 1772.95 I I thought it was easier to handle this way , ami_da_9
B 1772.95 but I do not know what they think . ami_da_11
C 1778.48 Sorry ? ami_da_12
C 1778.48 Depends on the screen . ami_da_9
B 1779.84 Would you like the the buttons horizontal or v vertical ? ami_da_11
B 1779.84 Th ami_da_3
B 1779.84 Right well ami_da_2
B 1779.84 if we make it like this , I think if you ami_da_3
B 1779.84 put it like this ami_da_6
B 1779.84 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 1783.94 For sound and channel . ami_da_11
C 1785.51 If you make the screen vertical it does not matter . ami_da_9
C 1787.86 If you make it in a rectangle ami_da_3
C 1787.86 I ami_da_3
C 1787.86 so it is it is ami_da_3
C 1787.86 it is ami_da_3
C 1787.86 it is ami_da_3
C 1787.86 Square . ami_da_4
D 1790.96 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 1798.79 I think it is it is easier to have it ami_da_9
D 1798.79 something like Oh a button minus here , plus over here . ami_da_9
D 1809.27 A minus here , plus over here . ami_da_9
C 1812.52 Oh , okay . ami_da_12
D 1813.17 And on here . ami_da_9
D 1815.67 The other buttons and on here the top . ami_da_6
D 1819.8 The options and then you have something like the P over here , and the sound . ami_da_6
B 1820.24 Yeah . ami_da_2
B 1821.01 But I think I wou ami_da_3
B 1821.01 I think that is a matter of what you are used to . ami_da_4
D 1833.61 Something ami_da_3
D 1833.61 Something like ami_da_6
D 1833.61 Sh ami_da_3
D 1833.61 Plus minus plus minus . ami_da_6
B 1835.1 I think I would put a plus and a min here . ami_da_9
B 1838.06 And then the P in the mid in the middle and the sound in the middle . ami_da_9
C 1850.89 Take your time . ami_da_14
B 1862.81 Almost . ami_da_4
B 1867.16 Yeah ami_da_2
B 1867.16 but I think when you are holding it , you could press the minus and the plus and with the other finger the minus and the plus . ami_da_9
D 1874.44 Yeah ami_da_12
D 1874.44 I think you are going to s ami_da_4
D 1874.44 you are going to use it with one thumb . ami_da_4
B 1877.46 Yeah ami_da_2
B 1877.46 but I think ami_da_3
B 1877.46 Yeah ami_da_2
B 1877.46 I do not know . ami_da_9
B 1880.14 Perhaps I have some examples . ami_da_4
C 1880.34 W ami_da_3
C 1880.34 We will leave that to the usability engineering then . ami_da_6
B 1882.03 I do not know ami_da_3
B 1882.03 That is me . ami_da_4
D 1884.69 Who is the usability engineering ? ami_da_5
D 1884.69 She is . ami_da_5
B 1887.64 But I am going to look if I have got some examples ami_da_7
B 1887.64 because perhaps you should choose what is most often used . ami_da_6
D 1892.33 Oh . ami_da_16
B 1893.7 The ami_da_3
B 1893.7 Because they can use that better . ami_da_4
C 1893.83 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 1894.15 Oh ami_da_2
D 1894.15 I have that those s numbers . ami_da_4
C 1895.54 Consistency . ami_da_4
B 1896.37 Yeah . ami_da_9
B 1898.52 I Here is our here are ami_da_3
B 1898.52 I do not really know . ami_da_9
D 1903.46 Or a good watch . ami_da_16
D 1905.49 B ami_da_3
D 1905.49 Channel selection . ami_da_4
A 1906.4 Everybody is searching in his data . ami_da_4
B 1908.58 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 1910.53 Per hour one hundred and sixty eight . ami_da_4
D 1913.49 Volume selection four times an hour ami_da_4
D 1913.49 Yeah , ami_da_12
D 1913.49 that depends on on on the remote . ami_da_4
B 1915.54 Yeah ami_da_12
B 1915.54 but But I mean if it is usually plus or min above each other or next to each other on a normal remote . ami_da_5
C 1920.02 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 1921.22 So not how much n not how often it is used , but ami_da_4
B 1924.29 W what is what is usual or normal . ami_da_5
B 1926.25 Yes ami_da_2
B 1926.25 I am looking here . ami_da_4
B 1927.75 But here is it is below , here also , and now here is here is next to each other . ami_da_4
B 1936.26 I think it is it is a ami_da_3
B 1936.26 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 1937.88 I think ami_da_3
D 1937.88 because I have two televisions at home . ami_da_4
D 1940.29 One is horizontal , one is vertical , so it depends . ami_da_4
C 1942.23 Yeah ami_da_9
C 1942.23 it does it does not really matter , ami_da_4
C 1942.23 but ami_da_3
D 1944.07 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 1945.24 Depends . ami_da_9
B 1951.41 I think the the the volume was usually above each other , because you go higher and down . ami_da_4
D 1957.08 Yeah , lower . ami_da_1
B 1957.88 And the the pay the the ami_da_3
B 1957.88 the program is next to each other , because you would go further and back . ami_da_4
D 1966.66 True . ami_da_9
B 1966.87 That is how it is is usually when I look here that is what I see . ami_da_4
C 1971.43 Okay , . ami_da_2
C 1974.62 Let is cut to the chase . ami_da_6
D 1976.36 It is got to change . ami_da_16
A 1978.58 Yeah well ami_da_2
A 1978.58 I think we have we do not have to decide about that now ami_da_6
A 1978.58 how ami_da_3
A 1978.58 where we will put the buttons ami_da_8
A 1978.58 just the ami_da_3
A 1978.58 concepts . ami_da_9
B 1983.16 I do not know . ami_da_6
D 1984.84 Yeah is it is user interface . ami_da_9
B 1987.32 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 1988.0 Component . ami_da_9
B 1989.39 This concept is in the actual design , ami_da_4
B 1989.39 but you should know where you would place a ami_da_6
B 1989.39 And the speech shall we implement that ? ami_da_11
B 1989.39 Or ami_da_3
B 1989.39 Yeah . ami_da_2
C 1992.87 Okay , well ami_da_2
C 1992.87 le ami_da_3
C 1992.87 Yeah . ami_da_9
C 1997.85 Interface , yeah . ami_da_9
A 2002.76 Yeah well ami_da_2
A 2002.76 we just heard about the new technology , huh ? ami_da_4
D 2004.92 Yeah I think it is it is easy for that , ami_da_9
D 2004.92 where are you , but then it says I am here . ami_da_4
C 2005.16 Technologies , . ami_da_4
C 2007.57 Yeah . ami_da_2
C 2008.88 Makes it possible to ami_da_3
B 2009.1 But then you should also find a place You could if you do it like this ami_da_6
B 2009.1 you could put it in a corner or something . ami_da_6
D 2009.5 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 2015.55 You can talk into the corner . ami_da_6
D 2016.69 Yeah , a microphone , yeah . ami_da_9
C 2018.29 Not even necessary , ami_da_9
C 2018.29 because a lotta ami_da_3
C 2018.29 you can make a very sensitive microphone , ami_da_6
C 2018.29 so it makes it possible to just put it arou underneath it or on the on the bottom of the remote . ami_da_4
B 2027.22 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 2027.46 Yeah ami_da_2
A 2027.46 maybe at the bottom where you can can hel hold it with you hand that there is also a microphone over there . ami_da_6
B 2028.18 But ami_da_3
B 2028.18 Yeah , that is also . ami_da_9
C 2030.69 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 2033.26 Right . ami_da_1
B 2034.28 So , ami_da_2
B 2034.28 in the middle or something . ami_da_11
C 2034.83 But that is not import ami_da_9
C 2034.83 I think that is not im very important ami_da_9
C 2034.83 because yeah , ami_da_9
C 2034.83 it does not matter where the microphone is . ami_da_9
A 2035.67 Yeah , ami_da_9
A 2035.67 yeah . ami_da_9
B 2040.31 but you should decide where you want to put it . ami_da_6
C 2042.1 okay , sure , okay , ami_da_12
C 2042.1 well ami_da_2
C 2042.1 tha ami_da_3
C 2042.1 Underneath ? ami_da_11
C 2042.1 Indeed . ami_da_9
B 2043.0 Right ? ami_da_11
B 2043.0 You could p you could put it in a logo of the company . ami_da_6
D 2044.9 I think where it is not seen the most . ami_da_6
C 2051.35 It should not be very visible . ami_da_9
D 2052.35 Inside . ami_da_6
A 2055.3 Yeah . ami_da_9
C 2055.46 Yeah sure ami_da_9
C 2055.46 , why no ami_da_9
C 2055.46 Yeah ami_da_9
C 2055.46 but it does not makes it any more fancy because you get to see ami_da_9
D 2055.67 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 2055.82 Well ami_da_2
A 2055.82 maybe just in the the spot you just pointed out ami_da_6
A 2055.82 because I think it should be in a in an important position where people can see it , ami_da_9
A 2055.82 because it is the the unique idea of our remote , huh , the the speech control . ami_da_4
D 2056.28 I i ami_da_3
D 2056.28 between the round of the R . ami_da_6
B 2058.78 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 2059.8 Yeah . ami_da_9
B 2067.09 Yeah . ami_da_12
D 2067.72 Yeah , okay . ami_da_9
B 2067.89 So ami_da_2
B 2067.89 where do you want to put it ? ami_da_8
B 2067.89 Yeah ami_da_2
B 2067.89 actually it does ami_da_9
B 2067.89 because it you can you can find it better if you use it . ami_da_4
A 2069.17 Well ami_da_2
A 2069.17 maybe where the one hand ami_da_9
A 2069.17 But are we talking about the button , or about the microphone ? ami_da_5
A 2069.17 Yeah ami_da_2
A 2069.17 because a microphone is very small thing , but you can make it look like it is big so as its its really an important function of the remote . ami_da_4
D 2073.31 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 2077.57 Yeah ami_da_2
D 2077.57 bu but ami_da_3
D 2077.57 I think the left s under corner should be the best . ami_da_6
B 2078.29 It is a way for you to ami_da_3
B 2078.29 So it makes more sense ami_da_9
B 2078.29 just because other remotes do not have that . ami_da_4
C 2083.67 Yeah , okay . ami_da_9
B 2087.12 About a microphone , there is no button . ami_da_4
B 2091.7 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 2104.13 Where is not i it is not most in sight . ami_da_6
B 2107.57 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 2109.37 Okay . ami_da_9
D 2109.72 I think . ami_da_4
C 2110.28 Well put it there . ami_da_9
C 2111.15 I do not mind . ami_da_9
C 2113.53 That does not does not really matter . ami_da_9
D 2115.48 No . ami_da_9
D 2116.8 Actually does not . ami_da_9
C 2118.6 Okay . ami_da_2
B 2119.37 Alright . ami_da_9
C 2119.97 So ? ami_da_2
C 2119.97 Interface type . ami_da_4
B 2120.77 Any more ami_da_5
B 2120.77 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 2121.83 So well ami_da_2
A 2121.83 type , supplements , anything . ami_da_4
A 2126.52 Yeah , well ami_da_2
A 2126.52 we already s discussed that , huh , the the LCD ami_da_4
A 2126.52 and ami_da_3
C 2128.69 The LCD ami_da_9
C 2128.69 yeah , ami_da_9
C 2128.69 supplements well the supplement is to ami_da_3
C 2128.69 yeah . ami_da_16
D 2130.7 I think I thought the , like you said , like scroll next to the remote is not that handy . ami_da_9
B 2135.31 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 2137.15 I think it is better to just up what you would like to do on the screen . ami_da_6
D 2141.19 If you want to go back you have to back button go back , ami_da_6
D 2141.19 if you want to choose audio settings you press audio settings ami_da_6
D 2141.19 and it goes to that ami_da_6
D 2141.19 s ami_da_6
D 2141.19 sub menu . ami_da_6
B 2143.13 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 2148.7 Hey , ami_da_2
B 2152.18 yeah . ami_da_2
B 2154.3 Yeah ami_da_2
B 2154.3 the the young people do like scroll ami_da_4
C 2156.39 Use the scroll . ami_da_4
D 2157.04 Yeah ? ami_da_11
D 2157.04 You do like it ? ami_da_11
D 2157.04 Yeah I think it is is faster . ami_da_9
C 2157.39 Yeah I think so too . ami_da_9
C 2159.48 So why not , on on side . ami_da_6
B 2161.68 Or at least ami_da_3
B 2161.68 Yeah ami_da_2
B 2161.68 I do not know if it is really the scroll , ami_da_9
B 2161.68 but the menu they like most , and I think you can never get through a menu great with a scroll ami_da_4
B 2161.68 But you have it is f ami_da_3
B 2161.68 we have five or four or something . ami_da_4
C 2169.16 Fast , ami_da_4
C 2169.16 yeah . ami_da_9
C 2171.58 So ami_da_2
C 2171.58 if you have got a settings , if you ami_da_3
C 2171.58 Yes . ami_da_9
D 2172.99 Becau ami_da_3
D 2172.99 I think the scroll is easier if you have a lot of options , but if you do not have a lot of option then ami_da_9
D 2172.99 Y ami_da_3
D 2172.99 Uh huh . ami_da_1
C 2177.49 You have a lot of options , ami_da_4
C 2177.49 because when you use ami_da_3
C 2177.49 Yeah ami_da_2
C 2177.49 you get w when you use the settings menu for example to look up some some channels on your on your television , you should scroll scroll down on a menu which probably does not fit on your screen . ami_da_4
D 2192.47 Yeah , okay , true . ami_da_9
B 2193.01 Yeah . ami_da_9
C 2193.39 So then it is very handy to to scroll down , ami_da_9
C 2193.39 you make just a rubber just like on your mouse or . ami_da_6
D 2196.38 Okay . ami_da_9
C 2200.5 Just put it on the side and it is very easy to use . ami_da_6
D 2202.83 Okay , no problem . ami_da_9
A 2204.04 And I think I would it would make even more fancy because you have another interesting thing on the side ami_da_9
A 2204.04 which you can touch ami_da_4
A 2204.04 and ami_da_3
A 2204.04 Yeah . ami_da_9
C 2208.66 Yeah , ami_da_9
C 2208.66 yeah . ami_da_9
B 2209.59 Yeah . ami_da_9
B 2211.3 It is also different . ami_da_4
C 2212.8 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 2213.72 Okay . ami_da_9
A 2214.4 Okay . ami_da_2
A 2215.61 Well ami_da_2
A 2215.61 there is our five minutes warning . ami_da_4
A 2218.72 any more questions about about the design or the user interface or different components , everyone ? ami_da_5
A 2218.72 Everybody think they can can work for that ? ami_da_11
A 2218.72 Is there a standard colour ? ami_da_5
A 2218.72 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 2224.79 No , colours are clear , shape is clear , material is clear . ami_da_4
C 2229.83 Okay , ami_da_2
C 2229.83 what is the standard colour ? ami_da_5
C 2229.83 I I ami_da_3
C 2229.83 You got you got different colours , ami_da_9
C 2229.83 but you should have a standard colour . ami_da_6
D 2231.7 And a standard , ami_da_3
D 2231.7 yeah ami_da_9
D 2231.7 we do not ami_da_3
D 2231.7 no we have different colour . ami_da_4
D 2234.19 How many colours are we going to ami_da_8
D 2234.19 Black . ami_da_9
B 2235.02 You should you should have a black one ami_da_6
B 2235.02 because I think black is standard . ami_da_4
D 2238.27 Yeah , black I think is is the standard . ami_da_9
C 2238.79 Black ? ami_da_12
C 2238.79 With the with the yellow ami_da_3
C 2238.79 Just a regular remote colour . ami_da_5
B 2240.47 But if you want to be different , then ami_da_3
B 2240.47 Silver . ami_da_1
D 2241.25 Dark grey , something like this this colour or something . ami_da_6
D 2244.92 Yeah like like ami_da_4
D 2244.92 yeah . ami_da_4
C 2246.25 And then have different covers to use . ami_da_11
D 2246.71 Or or silver . ami_da_6
D 2249.14 I think it is better to have silver nowadays . ami_da_9
C 2251.54 Silver , yeah . ami_da_9
D 2252.18 I think you see more silver than black . ami_da_4
C 2253.08 You see a lot of t silver televisions . ami_da_4
A 2253.77 But still silver and black are ami_da_3
A 2253.77 well ami_da_2
A 2253.77 silver is new but also traditional , ami_da_4
A 2253.77 so ami_da_3
A 2253.77 Yeah ami_da_2
A 2253.77 w what about a yellow thing , ami_da_11
A 2253.77 I mean it ami_da_3
A 2253.77 could be ugly , but it is definitely fancy . ami_da_9
B 2254.89 Silver rubber . ami_da_6
D 2255.25 Yeah the the silver black are our main colours . ami_da_9
D 2257.72 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 2258.65 I think we have silver , black ami_da_9
D 2258.65 and between those is like I ami_da_6
D 2258.65 dunno s five colours between them or something . ami_da_6
C 2267.11 Yeah ami_da_2
C 2267.11 y I think it is better to ami_da_3
C 2267.11 Yeah th ami_da_9
C 2267.11 yeah . ami_da_9
D 2267.48 Yeah ami_da_9
D 2267.48 yeah yeah ami_da_9

D 2270.5 R red . ami_da_6
B 2272.1 But ami_da_3
B 2272.1 yeah . ami_da_9
C 2272.46 That is right . ami_da_9
D 2273.07 Green , wood , brown . ami_da_6
C 2273.25 But if you use silver , rubber s silver rubber is not fancy . ami_da_9
D 2275.63 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 2280.52 True . ami_da_9
C 2281.2 When you use titanium , silver is fancy , but when you use silver rubber , it is not fancy . ami_da_9
B 2283.13 Yeah . ami_da_9
C 2285.97 Silver has to shine , and rubber does not shine . ami_da_4
C 2290.15 Especially when it is made of soft rubber like this . ami_da_4
B 2293.54 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 2295.58 You understand ? ami_da_13
C 2295.58 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 2296.72 Yeah , I understand . ami_da_12
A 2297.62 Yeah ami_da_2
