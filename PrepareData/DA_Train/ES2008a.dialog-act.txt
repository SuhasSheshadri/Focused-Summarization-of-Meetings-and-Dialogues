A 41.95 My name is Rose Lindgren . ami_da_4
A 43.03 I I will be the Project Manager . ami_da_4
A 46.13 our agenda today is we are going to do a little opening ami_da_4
A 46.13 and then I am going to talk a little bit about the project , then we will move into acquaintance such as getting to know each other a little bit , including a tool training exercise . ami_da_4
A 56.46 And then we will move into the project plan , do a little discussion and close , since we only have twenty five minutes . ami_da_4
A 63.86 First of all our project aim . ami_da_4
A 65.62 we are creating a new remote control which we have three goals about , it needs to be original , trendy and user friendly . ami_da_4
A 72.86 I am hoping that we can all work together to achieve all three of those . ami_da_14
A 77.13 so we are going to divide us up into three compa three parts . ami_da_4
A 82.14 First the functional design which will be first we will do individual work , come into a meeting , the conceptional design , individual work and a meeting , and then the detailed design , individual work and a meeting . ami_da_4
A 94.34 So that we will each be doing our own ideas and then coming together and collaborating . ami_da_4
A 101.16 Okay , ami_da_2
A 101.16 we are going to get to know each other a little bit . ami_da_6
A 103.78 So , ami_da_2

B 153.08 A L I M A . ami_da_4
B 155.82 Oh , ami_da_2
B 155.82 and I guess I am the Industrial Designer on this project . ami_da_4
B 160.4 So ami_da_2
B 160.4 let is see if I can get ami_da_3
B 160.4 here . ami_da_6
B 165.21 I will draw a little turtle for you all . ami_da_7
B 171.72 Not necessarily because it is my absolute favourite animal , but just that I think they are drawable . ami_da_4
B 180.36 And you have the pretty little shell going on . ami_da_4
B 185.05 Some little eyes . ami_da_4
B 186.79 Happy . ami_da_4
B 192.5 There you go . ami_da_6
B 193.48 That is a turtle . ami_da_4
D 195.19 Yes . ami_da_1
A 195.91 So what are your favourite characteristics ? ami_da_5
B 198.49 I I like the whole having a shell thing . ami_da_4
B 201.07 It is quite cool carry your home around where you go , ami_da_9
B 201.07 quite decorative little animals , they can swim , ami_da_4
B 201.07 they can , ami_da_3
B 201.07 they are very adaptable , they carry everything they need with them , and they are easy to draw . ami_da_4
A 217.04 Excellent . ami_da_9
A 218.4 Shall we just go around the table ? ami_da_11
C 220.07 Okay . ami_da_9
C 220.85 Well , ami_da_2
C 220.85 my name is Iain and I am the User Interface Designer for the project . ami_da_4
C 230.56 And I will try and draw my favourite animal . ami_da_7
C 239.09 I will ami_da_3
C 239.09 I should leave that one on there ami_da_7
C 239.09 should not I ami_da_11
C 239.09 before I callously rub it off . ami_da_15
B 240.19 No , ami_da_9
B 240.19 you can erase the turtle , ami_da_6
B 240.19 it is alright . ami_da_9
A 242.75 Might be nice to have them all up there at same time . ami_da_6
C 246.18 I am not going to draw it quite to scale . ami_da_7
C 275.17 Is that at least identifiable ? ami_da_5
C 275.17 It is a whale , yes . ami_da_4
B 278.14 Snake . ami_da_4
D 278.29 Well . ami_da_5
A 279.07 Em okay . ami_da_2
B 279.5 Well , ami_da_2
B 279.5 snake ? ami_da_5
B 279.5 It is w ami_da_3
B 279.5 Oh , ami_da_2
B 279.5 a cat . ami_da_5
C 281.05 Thanks . ami_da_14
D 281.21 Oh my god , it is better than what I am going to be able to do . ami_da_9
C 283.5 and , yeah , ami_da_2
C 283.5 the reason I like whales is because they are well , first of all they are quite intelligent and also they are they are kind of mysterious , ami_da_4
C 283.5 like we do not really know much about them or or understand how they work , how they form groups . ami_da_4
C 299.24 And I just find them interesting animals . ami_da_4
D 308.15 Take my contraptions with me . ami_da_16
D 312.1 Alright , ami_da_2
D 312.1 I am Jessy . ami_da_4
D 313.57 I am from around DC ish sort of in the US . ami_da_4
D 319.19 And we are going to keep the deep sea sort of theme going on , animal . ami_da_4
D 328.44 Do not really know how to draw this . ami_da_4
D 330.87 Just where can I ami_da_3
D 341.06 Maybe if I do the water , ami_da_7
D 341.06 but how ? ami_da_8
D 341.06 Sort of give an idea . ami_da_4
D 346.74 I have no idea how one would explain this . ami_da_4
D 350.7 maybe with some whiskers . ami_da_7
D 353.53 Briefly , it is supposed to be a seal . ami_da_4
D 356.66 You can imagine it in the water . ami_da_4
D 358.6 I like them , because they are like playful and silly sort of have a good time . ami_da_4
D 366.07 Not going to try and pretend like I can get any better than that . ami_da_7
A 375.64 okay ? ami_da_7
A 375.64 I am Rose and I am Project Manager , from California . ami_da_4
A 407.82 S ami_da_3
A 407.82 it is actually a coyote . ami_da_4
D 411.52 It is definitely significantly harder once you are doing it . ami_da_9
B 414.76 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 416.73 Let is see . ami_da_2
B 417.09 Right . ami_da_1
A 417.85 Let is see , ami_da_2
A 417.85 let is give it a little bit of a snout , I do not know , some teeth . ami_da_7
D 418.09 That is impressive . ami_da_9
B 420.78 That is ami_da_3
B 420.78 That is pretty impressive . ami_da_9
A 423.32 Yeah . ami_da_4
C 424.46 Cool . ami_da_9
A 427.44 Oh dear . ami_da_16
A 428.86 Yes . ami_da_16
A 429.42 I live I live right across the street from an open space in California . ami_da_4
A 433.23 We have coyotes howl all the time . ami_da_4
A 435.7 So I really enjoy their their singing , you they are really beautiful animals . ami_da_4
A 443.16 Okay , ami_da_2
A 443.16 moving on to slightly more serious stuff . ami_da_6
A 448.95 We are going to talk about project finances . ami_da_6
A 452.89 we have a couple ami_da_3
A 452.89 we would like to sell it for about twenty five Euro with the profit aim of fifteen million Euro from our sales and because this is such this is for television it is a we have a market range of Internet , like it is an international market range , we do not have to worry about specifics . ami_da_4
A 471.89 in order to make a profit of this magnitude , we need to be able to produce each one at a maximum of twelve fifty Euro . ami_da_4
A 482.36 So we are selling it for twice what we would like to produce it for . ami_da_4
A 490.42 Okay , ami_da_2
A 490.42 just to generate a little bit of discussion about the project , I could I would like to hear about your experiences using ro remote controls , your first ideas about creating a new r remote control , ami_da_6
A 490.42 what would be the best like you what are the features that you really like what are the features that you do not like , etcetera , ami_da_5
A 490.42 so ami_da_3
D 513.36 I hate when there is like four different buttons and you have to press to actually turn on the TV ami_da_9
D 513.36 like you have to do one for the power of the TV and then like another one to get the actual screen on and something else to get it all going , I do not know . ami_da_4
D 525.95 Now they keep combining all different remotes together , ami_da_4
D 525.95 and I do not know if I necessarily like that ami_da_9
D 525.95 because I feel like you end up with multimedia overload . ami_da_4
D 535.45 I just want to watch the TV . ami_da_4
D 541.43 Always gets lost . ami_da_4
D 542.8 Some sort of like device to help you find it . ami_da_6
C 551.1 I have used , I have used remote controls , for things like TV and the CD player and video recorder ami_da_4
C 551.1 and I ami_da_9
C 551.1 I guess they are ami_da_9
C 551.1 they are pretty neat ami_da_9
C 551.1 neat little tools . ami_da_9
C 563.39 You do not have to get up and walk across the room to change a channel . ami_da_4
C 567.06 So especially if you are someone really lazy like me ami_da_9
C 567.06 they they are pretty nice . ami_da_9
C 573.0 I find them ami_da_3
C 573.0 they can be a bit annoying , ami_da_9
C 573.0 especially , like you know if I am watching TV ami_da_4
C 573.0 I have have to have three separate remote controls of in front of me , you know , one for the TV , one for the digital box , one for m the video recorder as well . ami_da_4
C 588.15 And also they tend to they tend to be a bit confusing , they have got too many buttons on them too too sort of too sort of complicated ami_da_9
C 588.15 when all I really want to do is switch on and off , change the channel , change the volume . ami_da_4
B 603.44 Yeah . ami_da_2
B 605.81 I agree with having too many remotes around . ami_da_9
B 608.91 My dad has a whole drawer at home of remotes for various things , and I do not know how to work half of them . ami_da_4
B 617.43 What is important for me , I guess , is that it is easy to use and that there is not too many buttons , they are not too small , ami_da_4
B 617.43 you know you know you need to n to know what you are doing . ami_da_4
B 630.21 And one thing I particularly like is if you are not sort of moving it around to get it to work with the infra red . ami_da_9
D 637.59 Yeah . ami_da_9
C 638.12 Yeah . ami_da_9
B 638.34 , I think there is a way around that , but I know in my residence right now the the television you sort of have to walk all around the room to get it to turn on , so i it is just simpler just to just turn around the TV itself , ami_da_4
B 638.34 and I think that is if we are going to make a remote control , it should actually work for what it is doing . ami_da_6
B 657.32 So ami_da_3
B 657.32 I know . ami_da_1
D 657.92 What about like batteries and things like that , like are there some remotes that don do not require like batteries or do all remotes require batteries ? ami_da_5
A 666.65 I would imagine all of them , ami_da_4
A 666.65 but we could ami_da_3
A 666.65 but it is possible we could use like a lithium battery ami_da_6
A 666.65 that would last a lot longer than like double As . ami_da_4
B 671.94 Yeah , ami_da_9
B 671.94 something that does not ami_da_3
A 674.81 like tho those are the batteries that are used in a lot of MP three players now and that kind of thing . ami_da_4
A 687.94 Okay , ami_da_2
A 687.94 it seems we have a little bit of a conflict over to combining all the remotes cont together versus having f five different remotes . ami_da_4
A 697.8 So ami_da_2
A 697.8 like you said you do not like having all the buttons on one on one remote , and yet you do not want to have five remotes . ami_da_4
A 705.75 So how do we work with that ? ami_da_8
B 706.24 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 707.48 Could we get something that just has ami_da_6
B 707.48 No ami_da_9
B 707.48 does not have all the buttons that you need to program the video recorder or program s other things that I am not very coherent about , but that just has your major buttons for that work for everything , you know volume control , on , off , channel changing . ami_da_6
D 730.72 And maybe that spatially divides it , so it is like if you are looki if you are trying to get the TV on that is , you know , like the top thing on the remote , I dunno if d be vertical or horizontal in terms of how we are going to make it , but ami_da_6
D 730.72 if it is like all the TV stuff was here , then all the VCR stuff was here , all the whatever else we have programmed into it ami_da_6
D 730.72 it is all just in its separate place and not like all the on buttons together , ami_da_6
D 730.72 because then you like , I do not even know what I am turning on . ami_da_4
B 739.5 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 745.88 N that way ami_da_3
B 745.88 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 751.98 Yeah , ami_da_2
B 751.98 and if if you would save the more complicated functions maybe for separate remotes that you would not need to use every day . ami_da_6
A 761.29 Okay , ami_da_2
A 761.29 so maybe have like one remote that has the main functions on , off , channel changing , volume , and another rote remote with all the special things . ami_da_6
A 768.66 Because that is one thing that remotes tend to have buttons that the TVs no longer have as well . ami_da_4
B 768.8 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 774.54 So like you have to have them somewhere , because you are going to m need those special functions occasionally . ami_da_4
C 774.57 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 778.8 Right . ami_da_9
A 778.92 but not necessarily on the m the normal remote . ami_da_6
C 783.99 Can I ask , ami_da_7
C 783.99 are we designing a remote control for a television only , and if if this device is just to be used for the television would we even technically be possible to include video recorder functions on it ? ami_da_5
C 783.99 or should we just stick to just stick to having television television related buttons on it ? ami_da_11
C 783.99 So we should maybe we should assume that i t it is just a television that we are wanting to control . ami_da_6
A 789.11 Good question . ami_da_9
A 801.3 I do not know that yet . ami_da_4
A 810.4 It is a good question . ami_da_9
A 814.17 I will look into that . ami_da_7
A 815.99 If I can . ami_da_7
D 816.24 I think it is just TV , ami_da_4
D 816.24 I mean , if it if we are taking it just new product a new television remote control that is not like does not say . ami_da_3
B 827.41 yeah . ami_da_1
D 828.63 You know , things might be more advanced than that . ami_da_4
C 839.03 Well , ami_da_2
C 839.03 I mean I suppose it would be nice to have playing and record and stop buttons on it for the video recorder as well ami_da_9
C 839.03 I I do not know if that works technologically or not . ami_da_4
B 850.31 Yes . ami_da_2
B 850.6 I guess we have to define what what we are aiming for . ami_da_6
B 854.42 If it is just a television then that it is a bit simpler , because there is less buttons that would even need to be on it . ami_da_4
C 860.47 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 861.52 It is an idea with the buttons being really . ami_da_9
B 864.42 Large . ami_da_4
D 865.28 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 865.41 If you have older people or people like me that are not very co ordinated hand eye , it is really quite important that you are not pressing a small like teeny mobiles phone size buttons , if we can help it . ami_da_6
C 874.76 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 878.47 Okay . ami_da_2
A 879.36 Okay ami_da_2
A 879.36 sounds like we have had a good little discussion for our first ideas . ami_da_9
A 882.79 Mind if we move on ? ami_da_6
A 882.79 Ps ami_da_3
A 882.79 okay . ami_da_12
C 884.19 Okay . ami_da_9
A 886.71 now our next meeting starts in thirty minutes . ami_da_4
A 891.62 I believe we have actually been only working on this this one for about twenty , ami_da_4
A 891.62 so we can continue discussing more new ideas if you would like , ami_da_6
A 891.62 but this is just a breakdown of what we will be doing individually . ami_da_4
A 903.23 the industrial design , Alima will be doing the working design . ami_da_4
B 905.59 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 908.75 the User Interface Designer , that is for . ami_da_4
A 913.11 Technical functions , I guess like keeping in mind the buttons thing , the size of the buttons . ami_da_4
A 918.09 user requirements , so you will be hearing about different trends , about different things that people need , I guess kind of the same discussion that we have been having , we will get from the actual consum s consumers . ami_da_4
A 932.89 okay . ami_da_2
A 935.78 And you will get specific instructions sent by your personal coach . ami_da_4
A 938.78 I realised in this past one we we did not have much , we just wanted to get a little brain storming done . ami_da_4
A 943.31 so very exited to see all your animals ami_da_4
A 943.31 and how what wonderful artists we all are . ami_da_9
A 958.66 Any questions ? ami_da_13
A 958.66 I have not gotten an agenda yet , ami_da_4
A 958.66 I will put that together . ami_da_7
C 972.63 What we are going to be discussing at the next meeting ? ami_da_5
C 972.63 Do we know that ? ami_da_5
C 972.63 Right . ami_da_1
A 979.07 I am sure as we will each get our own instruction and then because what we going to do is first our individual actions ami_da_4
A 979.07 and then we will come back together . ami_da_4
C 986.13 Yep . ami_da_1
A 986.5 So I am sure we will all have more concrete things to contribute next time ami_da_4
A 986.5 okay ami_da_2
A 986.5 I will type up mi minutes and probably email those out to all of you . ami_da_7
B 988.8 Okay . ami_da_1
C 991.82 Yep . ami_da_9
B 992.5 I am sure we will be busy . ami_da_4
C 1002.35 Okay . ami_da_1
A 1002.47 just including all the things that we talked about . ami_da_7
C 1005.96 Can you e mail your slides as well ? ami_da_6
C 1005.96 Is that possible ? ami_da_5
C 1005.96 Cool ami_da_9
A 1009.26 Yes , I yes , I think I can . ami_da_9
A 1012.03 I will just attach it to an email . ami_da_7
