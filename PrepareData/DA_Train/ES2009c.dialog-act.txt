D 6.78 That went well , ami_da_15
D 6.78 thank you . ami_da_14
A 11.94 That is great . ami_da_9
D 13.67 Perfect . ami_da_9
B 14.36 Okay . ami_da_9
A 14.49 Alright , ami_da_2
A 14.49 let me just PowerPoint this up . ami_da_7
A 31.16 Right so ami_da_2
A 31.16 this meeting will be about the conceptual design , ami_da_4
A 31.16 do not ask me s precisely what conceptual design is , ami_da_6
A 31.16 it is just something important that we need to do . ami_da_4
A 40.14 , think of it is kind of turning the abstract into slightly more concrete . ami_da_4
A 44.82 In this meeting ideally we will come to some final decisions on what we are going to do for the prototype . ami_da_4
A 51.32 Right so , ami_da_2
A 51.32 apologies for the last meeting , ami_da_14
A 51.32 it was brought to my attention that I did not make the roles clear enough , ami_da_4
A 51.32 , so I will attempt to do so more accurately in this particular meeting . ami_da_7
A 61.36 , fair enough , ami_da_9
A 61.36 thanks for the input , ami_da_14
A 61.36 is always good . ami_da_9
A 67.23 So , ami_da_2
A 67.23 basically all we are going to do is have some presentations again much like last time , , and going to go through you , ami_da_4
A 67.23 whoever wants to go first is f fine by me ami_da_8
A 67.23 and we will collate what we know about what we discussed in the last meeting , possible directions . ami_da_4
A 82.61 And then we will make some more decisions on basic firm up our idea on how we want this remote control to look and work . ami_da_4
A 91.6 So , ami_da_2
A 91.6 perfect . ami_da_9
A 93.92 So , ami_da_2
A 93.92 without th further ado , whoever wants to go first is free to . ami_da_8
B 98.74 I will go first . ami_da_7
D 99.28 Go ahead . ami_da_6
A 99.4 Alright Nathan , ami_da_9
A 99.4 take it away . ami_da_6
A 108.03 It is Nathan right ? ami_da_5
A 108.03 I am not calling you the wrong name over and over again ? ami_da_5
A 108.03 Good . ami_da_9
B 109.92 No Nathan is fine . ami_da_4
B 111.84 It is either Nathan or participant two . ami_da_4
C 116.48 Mister participant two that is . ami_da_14
D 118.24 Nice . ami_da_9
B 119.15 Okay . ami_da_2
A 120.0 Nice . ami_da_9
B 122.13 basically what I am going to have to talk to you about today is component design ami_da_4
B 122.13 and it is been brought to my attention that we may be somewhat limited as to what we can do because of what our manufacturer offers , ami_da_4
B 122.13 so ami_da_3
B 122.13 Basically what I am going to be doing is talking to you about that . ami_da_4
B 139.16 , components of a remote control , okay . ami_da_4
B 142.04 We have already kind of gone over this ami_da_4
B 142.04 but we are going to have to get into more detail and probably have to reach some conclusions some time soon . ami_da_6
B 148.9 Energy source , , our manufacturer offers a variety of energy sources , your standard battery , solar cells . ami_da_4
B 157.37 Our manufacturer did not say anything about lithium ami_da_4
B 157.37 so we might have to look ami_da_3
B 157.37 if we do go that route , we might have to look elsewhere . ami_da_4
B 163.75 , and also there is a kinetic energy possibility . ami_da_4
B 167.08 Basically , it is like a the idea of moving the remote would create enough energy to keep it running . ami_da_4
B 173.4 So that is one possibility ami_da_4
B 173.4 but I do not know whether that would be powerful enough to illuminate a touch screen . ami_da_9
B 180.03 So we will have to look into that . ami_da_6
B 182.01 , the case , we have a few options , plastic , rubber or wood . ami_da_4
B 189.42 and then as far as the way it is shaped , we can do standard boring flat , ami_da_6
B 189.42 which we probably do not want to do , ami_da_9
B 189.42 curved or very sexy double curved . ami_da_6
A 199.72 What kind of th thickness are we looking at ? ami_da_8
A 199.72 Okay , ami_da_12
A 199.72 brilliant . ami_da_9
B 201.64 , I imagine that we could specify . ami_da_6
B 204.93 , I do not see any reason to go outside of the convention of three or four millimetres . ami_da_6
B 212.73 Yeah . ami_da_6
B 214.07 , the buttons , there are multiple scroll buttons available from our manufacturer , but to use those we would have to use more chips , and that would cost us more . ami_da_4
B 227.04 And if we do go with the rubber doubled curved case we will have to use rubber push buttons because the other buttons are not compatible with that . ami_da_4
D 236.42 Right . ami_da_1
B 236.86 and just a little note there , touch screen equals many chips which equals many Euro . ami_da_4
D 244.13 Right . ami_da_12
D 244.49 Nice . ami_da_9
B 245.78 , one thing that I noticed was that most remotes operate on a infrare on the infrared part of the spectrum . ami_da_4
B 254.94 So you notice when you push a button on a remote you ca not see anything coming out of it but in fact there is light coming out of the remote ami_da_4
B 254.94 and you know the television can detect that . ami_da_4
B 263.84 And if you were to record ami_da_3
B 263.84 if you were to make a video recording you could actually see the light . ami_da_4
B 268.54 one thing that I thought might be interesting ami_da_9
B 268.54 was to use part use visible light coming out of the remote , just kind of as a fun gimmick . ami_da_6
B 277.8 So you could actually see something coming out of the remote when you pushed it . ami_da_4
D 277.94 Interesting . ami_da_9
B 281.03 Course it would have to be a part of the spectrum that would not damage the human eye or anything like that . ami_da_6
D 285.46 Good call . ami_da_9
A 285.77 M ami_da_3
A 285.77 Maybe ami_da_3
A 285.77 is there an option that we can have that off or on ami_da_6
A 285.77 so a person can select like ami_da_4
A 285.77 Yeah I like the idea ami_da_9
A 285.77 , it is a good idea . ami_da_9
D 289.86 Choose it . ami_da_4
B 290.03 Yeah . ami_da_2
B 291.23 I am sure that we could do that . ami_da_9
B 293.37 , of course ami_da_3
B 293.37 Yeah , ami_da_9
B 293.37 just as a fun gimmick . ami_da_4
A 298.93 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 300.42 Just to set us apart a little bit . ami_da_4
B 302.21 , and then on to the circuit board that we are going to use , also known as the chip . ami_da_4
B 307.47 , we really do not have any way around the TA ami_da_4
B 307.47 one one eight three five . ami_da_4
B 313.36 findings , ami_da_4
B 313.36 okay , ami_da_2
B 313.36 we are very limited by what our current manufacturers can offer , ami_da_4
B 313.36 and my question to all of you is , should we look to other manufacturies or should we just make do with what we have available ? ami_da_11
B 313.36 Is a bit of a challenge question . ami_da_9
C 327.71 Interesting question . ami_da_9
D 329.89 Well ami_da_2
D 329.89 I would say shop around ami_da_6
D 329.89 but with our time constraints , is that really a feasible option ? ami_da_11
D 329.89 Right . ami_da_1
C 329.97 Yes . ami_da_9
B 334.45 Right , that is my concern too . ami_da_9
B 337.73 , if we do go the lithium battery route then we will have to go outside our current manufacturer . ami_da_4
B 343.79 My personal preference is ami_da_3
B 343.79 I will just throw my cards on the table , ami_da_7
B 343.79 I think we should probably go the solar battery route , ami_da_6
B 343.79 just to kind of keep with the environmentally friendly theme that we have going on . ami_da_4
B 355.99 , I like the idea of the visible light signalling , ami_da_9
B 355.99 that is something to set us apart ami_da_4
B 355.99 and I was thinking about I was thinking of ways that we could produce the remote in a variety of different case materials to suit different tastes . ami_da_6
B 370.07 So we are not so confined by one style ami_da_4
B 370.07 and say some you know , say our the one ami_da_3
B 370.07 if we just go with one and it does not go over well then we are in a bad situation . ami_da_4
D 381.43 Right . ami_da_1
A 382.26 Can we do marketing piloting too ? ami_da_11
A 382.26 Try to see what kind before we launch can we see how they are received ? ami_da_4
A 382.26 Okay . ami_da_1
D 388.36 It is an option , ami_da_9
D 388.36 but actually there is I have got some research already on like what we are looking at and trends in casing right now which actually might even come into play beforehand ami_da_4
D 388.36 , it may help us decide for now . ami_da_4
A 396.99 Okay . ami_da_1
A 399.78 Okay , ami_da_2
A 399.78 perfect . ami_da_9
A 401.43 Great , ami_da_9
A 401.43 thank you very much Nathan . ami_da_14
D 401.66 Temporarily anyway . ami_da_4
B 402.17 Oh yeah , you are welcome . ami_da_14
A 402.7 That is perfect , ami_da_9
A 402.7 so I guess that makes sense for you to take it from here . ami_da_6
D 405.21 I guess so , ami_da_9
D 405.21 because I found some interesting things . ami_da_4
D 411.67 You waiting for me ? ami_da_5
D 411.67 I know , ami_da_9
D 411.67 what a teaser ai not it . ami_da_14
A 412.21 Fascinating , compelling even . ami_da_14
C 412.76 Did you ? ami_da_14
C 412.76 I like it , I like it . ami_da_9
D 417.33 Right . ami_da_2
D 420.2 So ami_da_2
D 420.2 current market trends . ami_da_4
D 423.24 Screen . ami_da_16
D 424.7 , basically I was looking at what is going on in the remote control market right now ami_da_4
D 424.7 and what is going on in other design fields , to see sort of what is what is trendy , what is new , what is happening . ami_da_4
D 434.65 , remote control right now basically everybody says they want newer , fancier , more exciting they are sick of this boring , normal , functional , that we need innovative design options and there needs to be an easy user interface . ami_da_4
D 449.99 the challenge is that current trends right now , across the board in fashion , in furniture , in technology , is a very organic fruit and vegetable kind of thing . ami_da_4
D 462.13 Now I am not saying we should have , you know , tomato shaped remote controls or anything , but I think it is possible maybe to use natural colours , like if wood is an option , that whole organic , sleek , clean , v line thing may be something we can look into . ami_da_6
D 479.31 Different skin options , or if we ca not afford this touch plate thing , or touch face screen interface , maybe having the b images be specific , like you could choose your menu bullets to be a different shape ami_da_6
D 479.31 or okay , ami_da_12
D 479.31 not the example I would choose , but you know what I mean to t sort of and th apparently the feel of the next couple of years is spongy , ami_da_4
D 479.31 not something ami_da_3
D 479.31 I I have come up with a ami_da_3
D 479.31 though if we can get around to getting piloting , I thought maybe a casing option like not like a skin , but like a holder almost if you could do like , leather options or wood options or something ami_da_6
A 495.81 Tomatoes . ami_da_14
B 524.61 I should have mentioned this . ami_da_7
B 526.6 As far as the rubber that we can use we can use a rubber as part of the case , ami_da_6
B 526.6 it has a consistency of those stress balls . ami_da_4
C 533.96 Yes . ami_da_9
D 535.22 Might be an interesting way to go . ami_da_9
C 535.63 Fabulous . ami_da_9
A 535.73 Slick , slick . ami_da_9
D 537.99 , yeah so ami_da_2
D 537.99 something to sit on for now . ami_da_9
D 542.18 So ami_da_2
D 542.18 overall I think we should stick with what we are finding , ami_da_6
D 542.18 everyone is looking for easy to use , technologically innovative and this fancy new ami_da_4
D 542.18 I think perhaps the double curve thing and maybe this rubber option is our best way to go for right now . ami_da_9
A 556.99 Interface , oh the interface graphics for the ami_da_3
A 556.99 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 558.8 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 561.08 Well ami_da_2
D 561.08 I d ami_da_3
D 561.08 but then if the touch screen thing is not going to work out for us that is really a non issue . ami_da_9
B 566.91 I like the idea of of rubber too ami_da_9
B 566.91 because it is tends to be associated with being durable , something that you can drop and it does not matter . ami_da_4
D 573.6 True . ami_da_9
B 573.98 Because so many ami_da_3
B 573.98 you go to so many houses these days ami_da_4
B 573.98 and you see broken remote controls . ami_da_4
D 577.96 Very true . ami_da_9
A 578.8 Yeah , it is like , yep ami_da_9
A 578.8 it is ubiquitous ami_da_4
A 578.8 is not it ? ami_da_11
A 578.8 Great , ami_da_9
A 578.8 thanks for that Sarah . ami_da_14
D 578.93 Very true . ami_da_9
B 578.95 Taped with duck tape and what have you , you would not have that problem if you used rubber . ami_da_4
D 580.11 Very much so . ami_da_9
D 581.58 We could . ami_da_9
C 582.13 We can have a duck tape casing . ami_da_6
D 585.85 I think that goes against the whole fancy something , a new line , but worth a shot . ami_da_9
C 590.6 It could go with the granola crowd . ami_da_14
D 592.74 it could be , it could be , ami_da_9
D 596.16 Yeah ami_da_2
D 596.16 that is what I know . ami_da_4
D 599.77 No problem . ami_da_14
A 600.64 Ron ? ami_da_6
A 600.64 Yeah ami_da_9
C 602.4 Phew . ami_da_16
C 614.56 Computer is adjusting . ami_da_4
C 617.6 One moment please . ami_da_6
C 619.29 So ami_da_2
C 619.29 interme ami_da_3
C 619.29 interface concept by your faithful user interface designer . ami_da_4
C 626.26 So yur user interface , guys , is basically aspects of a computer system that we can see or hear , or otherwise perceive . ami_da_4
C 637.1 , commands and mechanisms , that basically user uses to control the operator operating system . ami_da_4
C 643.18 Here is a d series of different remote controls that are out on the market today . ami_da_4
C 647.46 I think we are definitely trying to get away from this kind of a look . ami_da_6
C 650.96 , so ami_da_2
C 650.96 the following are a bunch of different interface concepts . ami_da_4
C 658.51 voice recognition , we we actually have some new information from our research design team ami_da_4
C 658.51 but I will get to that in a moment . ami_da_7
C 669.03 , so ami_da_2
C 669.03 current voice recognition starts up to about eighty speech samples , and basically you record your own verbal labels c and connect them to the remote control . ami_da_4
C 678.69 Now ami_da_2
C 678.69 our design team , research team , has been able to set up a system in which you can teach the remote control voice c recognition system to respond to with standard responses . ami_da_4
C 694.89 Like you could say good morning remote control and it will say in a sexy female voice , Good morning Joe . ami_da_4
C 704.4 In fact we already have this for a coffee maker line On the remote control ami_da_4
C 704.4 right . ami_da_9
A 708.03 Lot of single people on the on the re on the remote control research team ami_da_14
A 708.03 at the ami_da_3
D 711.97 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 712.44 Very true , very true . ami_da_9
C 714.15 , another concept is what Apple has come up with , the spinning wheel with LC display like on the iPod which I am sure most of you know about . ami_da_4
C 724.28 and then we have the scroll button with integrated push button , kind of like a modern a bit bulky , a bit crazy , ami_da_4
C 724.28 I do not think that is we are necessarily going for . ami_da_6
B 734.17 No . ami_da_9
C 735.45 And some special components , ideas like blocking , having the ability to block channels from your for your children and dedicated buttons for for commonly used channels and even ideas like secured or hidden programming ami_da_4
C 735.45 but I again if we go with touch screen I do not think that is a big issue . ami_da_9
C 759.24 and this is kind of the the big daddy of remote controls here . ami_da_4
C 766.11 the jumbo universal remote control is almost impossible to misplace or lose . ami_da_4
A 770.72 Yeah , ami_da_9
A 770.72 I can see . ami_da_12
C 772.68 , again probably not what we are going for ami_da_6
C 772.68 so I ami_da_6
C 772.68 I mean my ideas here and ami_da_6
C 772.68 kind of where I think we are heading is something slightly larger than a regular iPod with a hard cla c plastic casing ami_da_6
C 772.68 although I think some of the suggestions we have come up with are definitely very good ideas . ami_da_9
D 782.83 Okay . ami_da_1
C 789.12 changeable casings our design team was possibly talking about including one extra face plate with the package ami_da_6
C 789.12 to kind of set the idea that you can change it and you can try changing it and kind of get used to thinking about maybe buying another one which can add value to our bottom line . ami_da_4
D 799.01 , right . ami_da_9
C 808.52 touch screen interface , possibly having go to buttons being stuck into the system ami_da_6
C 808.52 so those do not move away from the screen , , the important ones like power , volume and jump between channels . ami_da_4
C 821.51 , and of course our voice command system which I have talked a little bit about already and the use of recognisable colours and shapes to aid recognition of the features that are around ami_da_6
C 821.51 so ami_da_2
C 821.51 red for power , arrows for different volume ups and downs and channels ups and downs and what not . ami_da_6
C 843.11 And perhaps even adding in some stupid little jokes with the voice recognition idea ami_da_6
C 843.11 like perh for instance my toastie maker that I got from my bank has jokes when it is ready . ami_da_4
D 856.3 Nice . ami_da_9
A 857.92 Great . ami_da_9
C 858.26 And that is about it . ami_da_4
A 861.24 Great , wonderful Ron , cool . ami_da_9
A 864.56 Lot of good ideas , good facts to have . ami_da_9
A 875.46 That is what they need , it is like a little dongle it just sticks up this further ami_da_6
A 875.46 so you do not have to stand up every time , just connect it , my kingdom . ami_da_4
B 879.78 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 882.54 Right so , ami_da_2
A 882.54 good to know all that stuff , ami_da_9
A 882.54 thanks guys , . ami_da_14
A 887.95 Now we kind of have to come to some decisions , , I figure we can just go down the line and all three of us can have a chat about it . ami_da_6
A 896.97 Based on what Nathan presented as far as the various costs and benefits I think , I dunno , what do you guys think about the touch screen at this point ? ami_da_11
A 896.97 Okay . ami_da_1
D 913.19 I think it is our most marketable feature ami_da_9
D 913.19 just because it is so new and it is something that is showing up in other places . ami_da_4
A 920.05 Okay . ami_da_1
D 920.11 But can we really afford it ami_da_5
D 920.11 because it looks like they would be , that would be a really main cost source then ami_da_4
D 920.11 right ? ami_da_11
D 920.11 Per ? ami_da_5
D 920.11 Piece . ami_da_4
B 930.4 My estimate is that in order to incorporate touch screen technology it is going to cost us upwards of seventeen fifty Euro per remote , yeah that is just an estimate though . ami_da_4
A 939.61 To produce each one . ami_da_5
C 942.35 Oh you guys are always the dampers on these projects . ami_da_15
D 944.31 I know ami_da_9
D 944.31 And our goal was to be under twelve fifty or we have to be under twelve fifty ? ami_da_5
D 944.31 Do we remember ? ami_da_5
D 944.31 Okay . ami_da_12
C 946.34 You industrial designers . ami_da_15
B 947.52 I know . ami_da_9
B 949.06 It is fun . ami_da_9
A 953.99 Well . ami_da_2
B 955.03 I thought there was some flexibility with that . ami_da_4
A 957.24 There is , ami_da_9
A 957.24 it is just , it is a question of and ami_da_4
A 957.24 how much ami_da_4
A 957.24 ca o ami_da_4
A 957.24 does that mean we are going to have to increase the price to make money . ami_da_4
D 959.75 Can we justify it ? ami_da_11
D 959.75 Right . ami_da_1
A 965.0 , from twelve fifty if we d want to get our fift hundred per cent profit margin that would mean selling it from twenty five . ami_da_4
A 972.64 If you multiply seventeen fifty by two that is thirty five . ami_da_4
A 976.8 So ami_da_2
A 976.8 From the board , ami_da_4
A 976.8 , well ami_da_2
A 976.8 That is true , ami_da_9
A 976.8 I mean And that is to be fair the the per cent of the market ami_da_3
A 976.8 we are not going for mass any you know , mass sales anyway , ami_da_4
A 976.8 we are going to make ami_da_3
A 976.8 I mean we we are not talking about selling eight zillion of these things ami_da_4
A 976.8 , we just could not , not for twenty five Euros , ami_da_4
A 976.8 so ami_da_2
A 976.8 we could probably maybe shrink the profit margins rather than selling for twenty five , sell them for thirty , but that is something that we can have finance deal with . ami_da_6
C 979.81 Where do you guys come up with these numbers ? ami_da_5
C 979.81 I am thinking that is definitely a good idea ami_da_9
C 979.81 and I also think that we could probably come up with some sort of a cheaper means to to go about this kind of production , ami_da_6
C 979.81 my my team in the on the third floor suggested that ami_da_3
C 979.81 Yeah . ami_da_9
B 982.2 That is just off the top of my head , it is pending further emails . ami_da_4
B 988.69 Right . ami_da_9
D 991.53 Though I think that is what people would pay for , I mean if you are going to pay for an expensive high class remote , you are going to expect it to do something ami_da_4
D 991.53 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 999.28 It is the new ami_da_3
B 999.28 it would be in a class of its own . ami_da_4
D 1019.24 Right . ami_da_1
D 1031.09 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 1031.24 , I say that we provisionally go with the touch screen ami_da_6
A 1031.24 or wh y wh what was your thought on the matter Ron ? ami_da_11
D 1046.95 See if we can cut some corners . ami_da_6
D 1051.2 Right . ami_da_2
D 1051.73 Well ami_da_2
D 1051.73 and we can look into this other manufacturing option , ami_da_6
D 1051.73 and maybe we can get them somewhere else cheaper . ami_da_4
B 1055.87 It is true . ami_da_9
B 1057.43 We could initially go with what we have and if we can find them cheaper later on ami_da_6
B 1057.43 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 1060.66 Right . ami_da_1
D 1061.32 It is a starting point anyway , ami_da_4
D 1061.32 so . ami_da_3
A 1063.07 No ami_da_2
A 1063.07 we could have a s very simple touch screen , you know , ami_da_6
A 1063.07 there is always the opportunity , ami_da_4
A 1063.07 if it is going to be about the size of the iPod or whatever ami_da_6
A 1063.07 , you know , w we ami_da_6
A 1063.07 yeah , ami_da_6
A 1063.07 I guess we can play around with it a bit . ami_da_6
A 1071.73 Alright , ami_da_2
A 1071.73 let is let is say that okay so the touch screen will be our our main selling point here . ami_da_6
C 1081.08 I mean I think that we really have two main selling points ami_da_4
C 1081.08 , I think that our casing and the voice recognition To be honest , we have the capa we have the design in house ami_da_4
C 1081.08 , I mean we have we have come up with this , with this new voice we are using it for our coffee machines already . ami_da_4
A 1081.17 So ami_da_2
A 1081.17 The voice rec thing , ami_da_3
A 1081.17 I mean , if if we are looking at bottom line , now we are looking at upping the cost to seventeen to get the touch screen on , ami_da_4
A 1081.17 I think we might have to drop the voice rec . ami_da_6
D 1083.6 Yeah ami_da_9
D 1083.6 because with voice recognition ami_da_4
D 1083.6 I mean really this is pretty bells and whistles kind of remote . ami_da_9
D 1099.91 I think we would have to decide between them definitely . ami_da_6
A 1102.11 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 1103.16 Price wise . ami_da_6
D 1108.41 True . ami_da_9
D 1109.39 We have already got it . ami_da_4
C 1112.96 I can pass you on that email from my guy in guy down the hall . ami_da_7
C 1119.33 Sounds good . ami_da_9
A 1125.76 What do you think on it Nathan ? ami_da_11
A 1125.76 About the voice rec ? ami_da_11
B 1128.25 I think if we we do both the obviously production costs are going to go way up but it does put it into it would become the Rolls Royce of remote controls basically . ami_da_4
D 1139.86 Pretty much . ami_da_9
B 1140.27 It would be very nice . ami_da_9
C 1142.61 I mean we we have ami_da_6
C 1142.61 to r reflect back on what our market research did say . ami_da_6
D 1146.79 Right ami_da_9
D 1146.79 and they said they wanted voice recognition . ami_da_4
D 1149.37 Course , maybe they had not thought of this whole touch screen option , but definitely we know the market is there for voice recognition ami_da_4
D 1149.37 so to say we have the technology ami_da_9
D 1149.37 and we are not going to use it even though we know it will sell ami_da_9
D 1149.37 is a call I do not think I can give the highs ups . ami_da_9
D 1162.81 Like really I ca not go in and say no we are going to just ignore everything we know . ami_da_7
A 1166.97 Yeah . ami_da_12
C 1169.46 Does having both really up our costs ? ami_da_5
C 1169.46 Well my p is ami_da_3
C 1169.46 , I definitely have to agree with that last comment . ami_da_9
A 1173.5 I ca not see how it would not , I mean , there is you know the old aphorism , you can have it fast , you can have it cheap or you can have it quality , ami_da_4
A 1173.5 pick two of three . ami_da_6
A 1182.07 You know , you ca not you ca not have all three . ami_da_4
D 1182.71 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 1183.57 Yeah , ami_da_2
B 1183.57 because you you just upping the number of chips that you need to deal with each different function . ami_da_4
A 1184.81 It is just impossible . ami_da_4
D 1188.46 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 1191.16 Well ami_da_2
A 1191.16 if we are going to pick betwe e ami_da_3
A 1191.16 alright ami_da_2
A 1191.16 so we have to pick between one of the two . ami_da_6
A 1197.97 Otherwise , yeah , we just it just becomes cost prohibitive . ami_da_4
A 1200.91 What ami_da_3
A 1200.91 which , which do we suspect we should hold o we should hold on to ? ami_da_8
A 1200.91 Okay . ami_da_1
D 1205.6 Well , ami_da_2
D 1205.6 we already have research backing voice recognition as you know fiscally solvent . ami_da_4
D 1213.24 But I I I personally would tend to another direction but if that is what is going to sell I think that is what we need to go with and maybe we can table this touch screen for our next model . ami_da_6
B 1228.24 I would have to side with that , I think the voice recognition is simpler , ami_da_9
B 1228.24 we already have the all the technology in house , it is ready to go , it is packaged , ami_da_4
B 1228.24 it is ami_da_3
B 1228.24 , this is just off the top of my head keep in mind , ami_da_4
B 1228.24 but I think the voice recognition would ami_da_3
B 1228.24 they are both they are both going to push the costs up , but , since we already have the technology in house for the voice recognition we are not going to have to do as much design work and sometimes the design work is what push the costs up , if you know what I mean . ami_da_4
A 1238.0 What does the cost look like Ron ? ami_da_5
A 1238.0 Is it cheaper to do the VR or to do the touch screen ? ami_da_5
A 1238.0 Nathan ? ami_da_5
D 1264.89 Right . ami_da_1
A 1268.54 Right . ami_da_1
D 1269.86 Right . ami_da_1
D 1274.32 And we are still not ami_da_3
D 1274.32 then we do not have to deal with this battery issue nearly as much either , we can stick with what we have already got . ami_da_6
D 1280.48 In a lot other ways too . ami_da_6
A 1282.09 Okay . ami_da_2
A 1282.44 So ami_da_2
A 1282.44 I am getting ami_da_3
A 1282.44 alright so ami_da_2
A 1282.44 more or less you guys think that o o of the two of them , the voice recognition will be better . ami_da_4
A 1288.25 Okay . ami_da_12
D 1288.27 I think it is our lower risk option which for right now we can have it on the market sooner ami_da_4
D 1288.27 which is all in all our best option . ami_da_9
A 1290.1 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 1294.15 Okay . ami_da_12
A 1294.87 Sorted . ami_da_4
A 1296.99 We will omit the touch screen in favour of voice recognition . ami_da_4
C 1300.32 It is you and me outside a little here . ami_da_14
D 1302.58 So ami_da_2
D 1302.58 and when are we going to have basic prototypes coming up next that is you guys is next step ami_da_5
D 1302.58 right ? ami_da_5
D 1302.58 Right . ami_da_1
A 1308.6 Yeah , ami_da_4
A 1308.6 well ami_da_2
A 1308.6 we will we will sic we will sort out what it what f what else we are going to talk about for the prototype ami_da_6
A 1308.6 but yeah that is our next step , it will be a developing of prototype . ami_da_4
B 1312.74 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 1314.78 Okay . ami_da_1
B 1315.48 Are we going to talk now about the materials that we are going to use for the case and all those things ? ami_da_5
B 1315.48 Okay . ami_da_12
A 1318.99 Yes . ami_da_4
A 1320.26 We will just run through it ami_da_4
A 1320.26 yeah , ami_da_4
A 1320.26 yeah , . ami_da_4
A 1323.4 You discussed either a lithium or a solar power . ami_da_4
A 1326.49 Would the solar power be enough to fuel a voice recognition ? ami_da_5
A 1326.49 Or this kinesthetic one , would that be enough to fuel a voice recognition remote control ? ami_da_5
B 1334.5 , the solar power definitely would be but I think just to keep people from getting annoyed , because sometimes solar power fails and there is no way round that , ami_da_4
B 1334.5 we should install a small backup battery . ami_da_6
D 1346.89 Yeah . ami_da_9
B 1347.62 Just to cover those moments when for whatever reason , the remote has not been exposed to ami_da_4
B 1347.62 It is true . ami_da_9
D 1350.71 Well ami_da_2
D 1350.71 what of people with like the TV in their basement , ami_da_8
D 1350.71 like what if wha ami_da_3
D 1350.71 we ca not guarantee sunlight everywhere ami_da_4
D 1350.71 so having a secondary source is probably Yeah . ami_da_9
A 1353.94 Yep . ami_da_1
B 1358.17 Yeah , ami_da_2
B 1358.17 it works about the same as a solar powered calculator , and you know how those those do not really require that much light , , but obviously a little more light than a calculator , but we are not talking about a lot of light . ami_da_4
C 1361.04 Calculator . ami_da_12
D 1362.82 True . ami_da_9
D 1364.36 True . ami_da_9
B 1369.39 Does not have to be out taking a sunbath for a few hours a day or anything . ami_da_4
D 1372.27 Right . ami_da_1
A 1373.02 Right . ami_da_1
D 1374.5 Okay . ami_da_12
A 1374.71 Okay . ami_da_12
A 1375.7 What do you think Ron ? ami_da_11
A 1375.7 Okay . ami_da_1
C 1376.88 I am willing to agree with everything that is been said . ami_da_9
C 1379.86 I have to say though that another idea is come up in my head . ami_da_4
C 1384.28 If we are really not handling the remote control to a great extent we could possibly get away from the idea of having a hand held remote control and maybe kind of have a round remote control that kind of looks like a paperweight or something like that , ami_da_6
C 1384.28 kind of a sleek little neat thing that sits on your table or something . ami_da_6
D 1400.82 Interesting . ami_da_9
B 1407.35 Why , why moving away from hand held , why ? ami_da_5
B 1407.35 What is the idea ? ami_da_5
C 1407.43 Just a thought . ami_da_4
A 1408.65 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 1412.29 Well ami_da_2
C 1412.29 if you do not need to pick it up it could kind of be a selling point . ami_da_4
D 1414.82 I ami_da_3
D 1414.82 if it is got voice recognition it can be technically anywhere in your room and still do its job . ami_da_4
B 1419.94 Do you think people that are people that buy a remote , are they always going to want to use the voice recognition or is it just something that they do sometimes . ami_da_5
D 1426.37 True , ami_da_4
D 1426.37 and i probabl ami_da_3
D 1426.37 I think we are banking on selling it to more than just voice recognition people , like we want it to work fundamentally as a basic manual too , ami_da_6
D 1426.37 right . ami_da_9
A 1434.63 Well ami_da_2
A 1434.63 we have to have buttons on it too as well . ami_da_6
A 1436.91 But that is done , that is no bother ami_da_9
A 1436.91 I mean if you look at the catalogue from places like with sharper image or whatever you know they might have ami_da_4
A 1436.91 or like who is it , ami_da_5
A 1436.91 Apple makes these really pretentious speakers with the th sub woofers you know like clear and glass ami_da_4
A 1436.91 and you know ami_da_2
A 1436.91 and then they got these little pyramidal type of speakers . ami_da_4
B 1452.0 Right . ami_da_1
D 1452.52 Yep . ami_da_1
D 1454.9 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 1455.33 I mean , why not have a little rounded kind of thing , it could still have the basic buttons on it . ami_da_6
A 1460.37 , because we are going for basic functionality primarily as well . ami_da_6
D 1464.24 With the bu yeah . ami_da_1
A 1465.19 And maybe a menu button and so forth , ami_da_6
A 1465.19 you know ami_da_2
A 1465.19 use a channel button to scroll through the menu ami_da_6
A 1465.19 d if they want to record programmes or whatever ami_da_6
A 1465.19 you know ami_da_2
A 1465.19 I mean we can sort that out . ami_da_6
B 1472.15 I think , I think you are on to something ami_da_9
B 1472.15 because we need to escape the traditional shape of a remote . ami_da_6
A 1473.81 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 1479.39 Maybe something that looks nice on a table is would be good , even though and hand held the same time . ami_da_6
D 1479.83 True . ami_da_9
D 1482.26 Way to go . ami_da_4
C 1484.49 I think it is all about following Apple is lead on a lot of these things . ami_da_4
D 1488.31 Yeah ami_da_2
D 1488.31 I am thinking of the airport portal , ami_da_4
D 1488.31 you know like that little pod looking thing ? ami_da_13
D 1488.31 Right . ami_da_1
B 1492.63 Yeah , ami_da_12
B 1492.63 those are nice . ami_da_9
C 1492.87 Exactly . ami_da_12
A 1493.83 Yeah , ami_da_2
A 1493.83 I mean a nice although we do wh is ami_da_3
A 1493.83 I am recalling that she mentioned that we n need to get away from the surgical white kind of brushed aluminium thing and get back to it ami_da_4
A 1493.83 but you could have a very tasteful wood coloured or earth tone kind of ami_da_6
A 1493.83 Still , I mean , yeah , along those lines . ami_da_9
D 1507.51 That would be kind of neat . ami_da_9
D 1509.88 Terracotta bowl or something . ami_da_6
A 1514.97 Yeah I like that , ami_da_9
A 1514.97 I like that idea a lot . ami_da_9
A 1516.77 , let is see what we can do as far as that goes . ami_da_6
B 1519.69 Okay . ami_da_9
A 1519.93 And the the material like the plastics and so forth , we were discussing that being using like a rubber kind of softer feel , ami_da_4
A 1519.93 you know ami_da_2
A 1519.93 li lik ami_da_3
A 1519.93 if you feel the the tip on this pen it is a bit gives just a bit . ami_da_4
D 1533.96 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 1534.25 You know ami_da_2
A 1534.25 something where it is a a more advanced f form of plastic that has some kind of a tactile response to it . ami_da_6
B 1541.18 Right . ami_da_12
B 1543.7 Just kind of the squishy feel . ami_da_6
D 1545.73 Yeah , ami_da_9
D 1545.73 which is the next big thing , so that is not going to hurt us either . ami_da_4
A 1549.53 okay . ami_da_9
A 1550.78 Yeah ami_da_2
A 1550.78 let is see if we can do a squishy non remote control looking remote control . ami_da_6
A 1556.31 But to be fair , yeah , ami_da_4
A 1556.31 I mean , you just c you could just put it ami_da_4
A 1556.31 literally put it on the the ni the coffee table next to the telly and say volume up . ami_da_4
D 1562.58 Right . ami_da_1
A 1565.4 Yeah I like it , ami_da_9
A 1565.4 I like the idea , ami_da_9
A 1565.4 that is good . ami_da_9
D 1565.54 Handy . ami_da_9
A 1568.14 and we have sorted of discussed costs , ami_da_4
A 1571.86 I guess we will a that is going to be a thing , if we run a bit over budget , that might be okay , . ami_da_9
B 1578.13 Sorry about the lack of information on cost , ami_da_14
B 1578.13 I just have not been provided that information by our manufacturers and I am just having to guess . ami_da_4
D 1583.26 Okay . ami_da_9
A 1584.38 We will have more of an idea when the prototype have more of a ami_da_3
A 1584.38 we will have more of an idea later on . ami_da_4
A 1591.79 And we just yeah go from there . ami_da_6
A 1594.12 , so ami_da_2
A 1594.12 we have revisited the touch screen and more or less ruled that out , ami_da_4
A 1594.12 , I think so we are more or less con ami_da_3
A 1594.12 we wh wh ami_da_3
A 1594.12 we are more or less in agreement that we want to have a a simple kind of function , you know , not too complex . ami_da_4
D 1611.35 Right . ami_da_2
D 1612.17 Well ami_da_2
D 1612.17 when the majority of people are only using the most primary functions on a daily basis , ami_da_4
D 1612.17 although I am not saying we should completely rule out major functions , they should be secondary , at least if not functionally then visually , like those should not be Take precedence , ami_da_6
D 1612.17 yeah . ami_da_9
B 1627.26 Right . ami_da_1
A 1627.97 Like maybe have menu things . ami_da_6
B 1629.6 If , if we are not going the touch screen route then we can just incorporate maybe something that folds out ami_da_6
B 1629.6 like what you often see on these kinds of remotes is the most basic functions up here and something that slides down to reveal the you know more complicated things . ami_da_4
D 1636.54 Right . ami_da_1
D 1640.59 And they slide . ami_da_4
A 1644.94 Yes . ami_da_1
D 1645.3 Well ami_da_2
D 1645.3 and do we want to consider like an iPod screen ami_da_11
D 1645.3 which is not a touch screen but you are still scrolling through menu options , ami_da_4
D 1645.3 in p ami_da_3
D 1645.3 True , ami_da_9
D 1645.3 we are still not making it easier then . ami_da_4
C 1652.77 Think then we are hitting our cost issue again . ami_da_9
A 1655.23 Yeah ami_da_2
A 1655.23 we have also got the the me the thing of , ami_da_3
A 1655.23 if we are going to have a non remote looking remote ami_da_9
A 1655.23 , how do we yeah . ami_da_9
B 1655.48 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 1659.6 True . ami_da_1
D 1661.3 Fair enough . ami_da_9
A 1661.43 B ami_da_2
A 1661.43 But no ami_da_2
A 1661.43 I mean ami_da_2
A 1661.43 we could do a slide or a compartment , ami_da_6
A 1661.43 you know , ami_da_2
A 1661.43 like if it say it is a lit little vaguely ovoidal type of thing , it would be easy to have a compartment in there . ami_da_4
D 1664.68 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 1669.54 Or you know , a b a b a a series of you know three or four buttons with a menu button and then a side an s up and down type of thing , like on like on a DVD player . ami_da_6
A 1678.05 You know ami_da_2
A 1678.05 you see the modern DVD players will just have a menu button on the side and then four buttons around them and you can just kind of manoeuvre through the menu like that . ami_da_4
D 1682.82 Yeah ami_da_9
D 1682.82 it is just a scroll . ami_da_4
B 1684.26 Right . ami_da_1
D 1685.48 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 1687.19 So ami_da_2
B 1687.19 are we going to are we talking ami_da_3
B 1687.19 we need to figure out what kind of buttons we are going to use , ami_da_8
B 1687.19 are we going to use scroll buttons ? ami_da_11
B 1687.19 Rubber buttons ? ami_da_11
B 1687.19 Right . ami_da_9
A 1696.33 Well ami_da_2
A 1696.33 it seems like ami_da_3
A 1696.33 I dunno ami_da_2
A 1696.33 it seems to me that we could just do the stick with the rubber ami_da_6
A 1696.33 because since we are probably going to be using some kind of rubber for the outside case ami_da_4
A 1696.33 we might as well stick with that . ami_da_6
D 1703.04 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 1708.26 Probably . ami_da_9
C 1711.89 I think to a certain extent we have to stick with kind of a little bit traditional in terms of the buttons and then and then make our unique feature our casing and what not and our voice command . ami_da_6
D 1718.9 Right . ami_da_1
D 1723.22 Well no ami_da_2
D 1723.22 it is basic just like four directions that are that can use as menu or channel and volume or however you want to do it , are really versatile ami_da_4
D 1723.22 and everybody is already got them to some extent on the remotes they already own ami_da_4
D 1723.22 so it is not like we are dealing with everybody relearning things because that is not something anybody is going to want to buy a new for . ami_da_4
B 1741.12 Right . ami_da_1
A 1743.7 okay , . ami_da_2
A 1748.62 We have already kind of covered this as well . ami_da_4
A 1751.45 That seems to be selling and we we have more or less agreed that we want to kar target this youth market , . ami_da_4
A 1760.85 Especially now with eighteen to thirty five year olds being such a large quantity of the population . ami_da_4
D 1764.75 Right , ami_da_9
D 1764.75 particularly in technological fields , so that is exactly where we are headed . ami_da_4
A 1768.92 Okay . ami_da_1
A 1773.81 Yeah alright , well , ami_da_2
A 1773.81 more or less covered what we need to cover I think ami_da_4
A 1773.81 fi an an ami_da_3
A 1773.81 any final thoughts before we think about doing the protot moving on to the prototype . ami_da_8
C 1781.66 Well what are we actually doing ? ami_da_5
C 1781.66 What were ami_da_3
C 1781.66 Sure . ami_da_9
A 1783.82 Right . ami_da_2
A 1784.3 I was just going to step on to ami_da_7
A 1784.3 I was not ? ami_da_5
A 1784.3 Oh , ami_da_12
A 1784.3 my bad ami_da_15
A 1784.3 sorry . ami_da_14
D 1789.32 Oh ami_da_2
D 1789.32 it was not in the way ami_da_4
D 1789.32 but yeah , whatever . ami_da_4
D 1793.85 No , do not worry about it . ami_da_14
A 1795.55 The ami_da_3
A 1795.55 , yeah okay ami_da_2
A 1795.55 I was just going to assign tasks in the next ami_da_7
A 1795.55 b anyth any oth ami_da_3
A 1795.55 any other final thoughts before we go ahead and ami_da_8
A 1795.55 cool ? ami_da_11
D 1800.74 Okay . ami_da_9
B 1804.73 So ami_da_2
B 1804.73 have we decided that we are going to go with different style cases for different people ? ami_da_5
B 1804.73 Or are we just going to go with one ? ami_da_5
B 1804.73 .It is very , it is very hard thing to predict ami_da_9
B 1804.73 because you have different cases and that might open up your market a little bit obviously , but if you have just one case and it does not go very well . ami_da_4
D 1804.84 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 1820.08 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 1828.29 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 1828.44 Right . ami_da_1
B 1828.64 It is a tough situation , ami_da_9
B 1828.64 but obviously having more cases also costs more ami_da_4
B 1828.64 so ami_da_3
B 1828.64 There is an idea . ami_da_9
A 1832.17 Well ami_da_2
A 1832.17 then again colours would not be so hard to do , ami_da_9
A 1832.17 you could have a , you know , a kind of a natural wood colour , like a stained wood and , I do not know , olive green or something . ami_da_6
D 1844.69 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 1845.24 That would not be so much of a problem to incorporate into the colour of the thing . ami_da_9
C 1849.36 And again copying iMac is kind of for iPod Mac Apple is colour scheme . ami_da_6
D 1852.95 Yeah , ami_da_9
D 1852.95 get in there . ami_da_6
D 1855.52 Yeah , totally . ami_da_9
A 1857.19 Yeah , I think that is probably a good ami_da_9
A 1857.19 id ami_da_9
A 1857.19 okay ami_da_2
A 1857.19 so ami_da_2
A 1857.19 let is work on multiple case colours . ami_da_6
A 1867.12 But yeah , ami_da_2
A 1867.12 stick with the same kind of kind of ami_da_6
A 1867.12 yeah , the same basic non remote kind of remote design . ami_da_6
A 1875.83 Cool . ami_da_9
A 1878.02 Alright , so ami_da_2
A 1878.02 we will have the next meeting about half an hour , . ami_da_4
A 1882.43 I want the I would like ami_da_3
A 1882.43 Nathan , I would like you to work on just the basic look and feel , what can we accomplish , , given these parameters that we are just going to sort of have this kind of non remote remote . ami_da_6
A 1896.37 , what are our broad constraints before we deve design a prototype . ami_da_6
B 1896.4 Right . ami_da_9
A 1902.78 And Ron if you can figure out how probably best to lay out this idea of this simple design with the voice recognition built in and also this kind of drop down or s on the side kind of menu options simple . ami_da_6
A 1920.16 Somehow work out how we can get this all s in the same place . ami_da_6
A 1925.33 , and if you can check product evaluation with m some pilots and stuff . ami_da_6
A 1929.67 I need you guys to work together on making a prototype , using prototype building materials . ami_da_6
A 1940.49 And also specific instructions will be sent to you by your coaches as well . ami_da_4
B 1943.65 Oh excellent ami_da_9
B 1943.65 yeah . ami_da_9
A 1944.39 So that is what to start with for now , ami_da_4
A 1944.39 is that alright , ami_da_11
A 1944.39 you guys feel clear about this ? ami_da_13
A 1944.39 Alright . ami_da_2
D 1946.04 Cool . ami_da_9
A 1949.38 I guess we will just hit the bricks . ami_da_6
