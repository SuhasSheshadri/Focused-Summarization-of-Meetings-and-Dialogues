C 32.23 we are ami_da_3
C 32.23 So the meeting will have about the same format as the last time . ami_da_4
C 37.02 So switching over I have just left my first two screens . ami_da_4
C 41.86 mailed you the minutes of the last meeting just to save time . ami_da_4
D 51.36 Okay . ami_da_9
D 51.97 Cool . ami_da_9
C 52.97 and is there any questions you have that arised from last meeting that are particularly bothering you ? ami_da_11
C 52.97 N ami_da_3
C 52.97 No ? ami_da_9
C 52.97 Okay , cool . ami_da_9
D 65.05 No , I do not think so . ami_da_9
A 67.54 No . ami_da_1
C 67.78 Then we shall start with a presentation from Raj . ami_da_6
B 71.64 Yeah . ami_da_7
B 76.94 Hi , me Raj , again . ami_da_14
B 78.7 in this meeting I I am going to discuss about the trend watching , ami_da_7
B 78.7 how these trends is going to affect our market potential and how important is this . ami_da_4
B 89.49 So we have to look on this . ami_da_6
B 92.92 First of all methodology . ami_da_4
B 94.67 The met methodology to find out the trend was incl was done in a way ami_da_3
B 94.67 We have done a rec not only a recent remote control market survey , but we also considered the latest fre fashion trends of the market , because we think that this is also a factor which will affect our sales and profit . ami_da_4
B 115.25 So what are our findings ? ami_da_4
B 115.25 In our in our findings we have seen that ami_da_2
B 115.25 when we did our remote control market survey we found that people l people do have preference for tho fancy mobi f remote controls which look and feel very good , rather than having a functional look and feel good . ami_da_4
B 138.23 So this sh this clearly indicates their preference for the design their outlook of the remote controls . ami_da_4
B 144.46 So we should take into ami_da_2
B 144.46 we should consider this factor as the most important factor , ami_da_6
B 144.46 because this factor is twice as important , the second factor which is further ti twice the as important as the sec as the third factor . ami_da_4
B 158.91 So this factor becomes the most important factor in our surv in our mark means in take in designing our rem remote controls . ami_da_4
D 169.43 The last one is the most important one , is it ? ami_da_5
D 169.43 Oh , sorry . ami_da_14
B 171.16 No the first one is the the outlook of the mobile , the it should have a fancy outlook , the fancy design rather than just having a functional look and feel good , it should have a fancy look and foo feel good . ami_da_4
D 177.27 Okay . ami_da_1
D 179.2 Okay . ami_da_1
B 186.85 The second most important aspect is that remote control should be a technologically innovative . ami_da_4
B 192.71 We must have some technological advancement in the remote control tha rather than just putting it as it is as the other remo remote controls are . ami_da_4
B 201.36 So it should be technologically innovative like glow in the dark or speech recognition , something like that . ami_da_6
B 208.55 So that indicates our technological advancement . ami_da_4
B 212.63 And the third most important aspect in the ta to take into consideration is that it should be easy to use , like it should not be too much co complicated , there should not be too many buttons on this mobi remote control , it should not be too complicated like this way . ami_da_4
B 231.04 And it should be ami_da_2
B 231.04 and customers should be provided with manuals that is easy to understand in their local language , something . ami_da_6
B 238.57 So that they could know how to use these remote controls . ami_da_4
B 245.07 When we did f fashions , recent fashion our recent fashion update shows that ami_da_3
B 245.07 yeah ? ami_da_11
B 245.07 Y ami_da_9
B 245.07 yeah ami_da_9
B 245.07 yeah , ami_da_9
B 245.07 we have to , ami_da_6
B 245.07 because d you can see how people have related their clothes , shoes , and everything with fruits and vegetables , because the g world is now changing it is trend towards organic , becoming more and more organic , ami_da_4
B 245.07 becoming ami_da_3
B 245.07 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 253.46 Sorry . ami_da_14
D 254.52 I was just reading fruit and vegetables . ami_da_4
D 257.29 Hard to know how we are going to incorporate that . ami_da_9
D 273.6 Okay . ami_da_1
D 274.51 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 275.82 We should make a big sponge lemon , ami_da_14
A 275.82 and then it would be it would be yellow . ami_da_4
D 277.57 Yeah . ami_da_14
B 279.46 So ami_da_2
B 279.46 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 279.72 Th that is very good . ami_da_14
A 279.78 It is ami_da_3
A 279.78 Yeah . ami_da_9
B 282.71 So something like that we we should do . ami_da_6
D 283.15 Glow in the dark . ami_da_14
D 286.1 Okay . ami_da_9
B 287.01 And people ami_da_2
B 287.01 the f feel of the material is expected to be spongy rather than just having a plastic look , hard look . ami_da_4
D 294.83 Well , that is good . ami_da_9
D 295.49 That is what we kind of predicted anyway . ami_da_9
B 295.7 Yeah . ami_da_9
B 296.62 Yeah . ami_da_9
B 297.73 So so that they could play with it while handi while handling it . ami_da_4
D 302.38 Okay . ami_da_1
B 302.7 So that should also be taken into consideration . ami_da_6
D 304.45 Okay . ami_da_1
B 306.39 So these are my views . ami_da_4
D 306.47 Okay . ami_da_1
D 308.21 Okay , the spongy , not real spongy , ami_da_9
D 308.21 you can ami_da_2
D 308.21 Do you think like rubber would be good or does it really want to be like gel kind of stuff ? ami_da_11
D 308.21 Okay . ami_da_9
B 308.31 So No it ca y a ami_da_3
B 308.31 The rubber which is good for health and which is quite disposable that we can take into co ami_da_6
B 308.31 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 320.34 Quite disposable . ami_da_12
D 321.73 Okay . ami_da_9
B 321.94 Because we It should not be have any harm to the environment also , because our company is very well for taking all these concerns into consideration , so we do not want to have any harm to the society , ami_da_4
B 321.94 so ami_da_2
B 321.94 So that is all . ami_da_4
D 325.09 Oh okay . ami_da_1
C 325.43 Alright , okay . ami_da_1
D 330.54 Uh huh . ami_da_1
D 333.92 Okay . ami_da_9
C 336.05 Fashion . ami_da_3
D 339.16 Cool . ami_da_9
C 339.52 okay . ami_da_2
C 342.29 Fruit and veg , well there you go . ami_da_16
C 345.14 Just what I think of when I think of a remote control . ami_da_14
D 347.07 A remote control ? ami_da_9
D 347.07 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 355.27 And were there any factors that were not important in the survey , that they said we do not want ? ami_da_5
D 355.27 Or was it just ami_da_3
D 355.27 Okay . ami_da_9
B 361.08 S we did not find out any such point . ami_da_4
B 365.69 yes , there could be , but we could not find out any , so ami_da_4
B 365.69 Yeah . ami_da_9
C 366.27 Mm mm mm mm . ami_da_1
D 369.75 Cool . ami_da_9
C 375.14 Mm mm mm mm mm . ami_da_1
D 376.8 F , what is it ? . ami_da_5
C 379.7 Function F eight . ami_da_4
D 384.44 yeah . ami_da_11
D 386.88 Okay . ami_da_9
D 393.47 No signal . ami_da_4
B 393.76 Oh no , . ami_da_9
D 398.63 Is that ? ami_da_5
D 398.63 Okay , ami_da_9
D 398.63 and then F five , right ? ami_da_5
D 398.63 Okay . ami_da_9
A 399.82 No , it is got it is got it . ami_da_4
B 399.97 Yeah , ami_da_4
B 399.97 yeah , ami_da_4
B 399.97 yeah . ami_da_4
B 404.15 Yeah . ami_da_9
C 405.63 Excuse me . ami_da_14
C 408.16 , yeah . ami_da_4
D 410.32 okay , so the interface concept . ami_da_4
D 417.74 Yeah . ami_da_4
D 418.69 The interface specification , ami_da_4
D 418.69 what people ami_da_2
D 418.69 how they interact with it basically , I think . ami_da_4
D 425.85 so the method , we looked at existing designs , ami_da_4
D 425.85 what are the ami_da_2
D 425.85 what is good about them , what is bad about them , I looked at their flaws , ami_da_4
D 425.85 so we are going to look at their flaws , everything . ami_da_6
D 436.31 and what the survey told us and what we think would be good , so a bit of imagination . ami_da_4
C 444.62 okay . ami_da_1
D 445.48 the findings , I have got some pictures to show you as well . ami_da_4
C 448.66 either . ami_da_14
D 449.43 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 451.03 Okay , so most remote controls use graphical interface , where you have got s buttons and you point it rather than having the output as a a stream of text or something . ami_da_4
C 462.03 okay . ami_da_1
D 462.87 and we also found that there is inconsistent layout , which makes it confusing . ami_da_4
D 467.64 So I think for our remote control There is some inconsistency already in ec existing in between remote controls , but I think standard kind of shape and play and those kind of but buttons like the the top right for on and off or something , I think , people find that important,because then it is easy to use . ami_da_4
C 483.73 Right , okay . ami_da_9
C 484.51 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 487.43 And we have got some pictures of some new remote controls to show you . ami_da_7
D 491.78 Do I press Escape F five ? ami_da_5
D 491.78 Or just ami_da_5
D 491.78 Escape , okay . ami_da_9
C 491.81 Excellent . ami_da_1
C 494.1 no just escape ami_da_4
C 494.1 should ami_da_3
C 494.1 Okay . ami_da_1
D 497.8 , oh I still have not got my glasses on . ami_da_4
D 501.35 Yeah , okay . ami_da_9
D 502.46 So these are the some of the pictures of existing ones . ami_da_4
A 507.83 Wow . ami_da_16
D 508.08 I will just walk you through them . ami_da_7
D 509.83 This one is a voice recognition . ami_da_4
D 513.59 And that is the kind of idea we are going for . ami_da_4
C 515.4 Looks pretty complicated . ami_da_9
D 516.78 There is an LCD thing , ami_da_4
D 516.78 which we thought could ami_da_2
D 516.78 I thought could get a bit confusing and a bit expensive as well for us . ami_da_9
C 524.76 Right , okay . ami_da_1
D 526.22 This one is got a kind of scroll like a mouse , ami_da_4
D 526.22 which ami_da_3
D 526.22 Yeah . ami_da_9
C 530.55 , like the middle button . ami_da_9
C 533.4 Okay . ami_da_9
D 533.98 and But I am not exactly sure how you would use that , ami_da_4
D 533.98 like would the computer come ami_da_3
D 533.98 Uh huh , that is like the LCD one , ami_da_4
D 533.98 is it ? ami_da_5
D 533.98 But the one below that has got like a little scroll function on the side . ami_da_4
C 538.45 it is kind of like scrolling ami_da_4
C 538.45 right , well , ami_da_2
C 538.45 if I s if I am thinking of the right one , I have got the same thing in front of my monitor , you scroll it and the when you reach the sort of menu item that you require , you press the middle of the scroll . ami_da_4
C 552.46 Right , okay . ami_da_9
D 557.1 But I presume that the functions must come up on the TV screen . ami_da_4
C 561.32 Yeah , presumably . ami_da_9
D 561.96 I think that is what that is . ami_da_4
B 562.1 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 563.48 So these are just a few ideas . ami_da_4
D 564.99 Again that is just quite boring shape , grey , looks quite space agey , but too many buttons , I think on that one . ami_da_9
C 569.72 Yeah , looks like looks like something out of a jet . ami_da_9
A 569.9 it looks threatening . ami_da_9
D 571.48 Yeah , it does look kind of dangerous . ami_da_9
A 573.77 It looks like ami_da_3
A 573.77 yeah . ami_da_1
D 574.63 this one I thought was really cool . ami_da_9
D 576.55 It is w it is got the programmability function that we talked about . ami_da_4
D 579.62 You can put it in there , it is for your kids , and it is quite an organic shape ami_da_4
D 579.62 and the little circle around there is pretty cool . ami_da_9
C 587.12 Okay . ami_da_1
D 587.43 And that is really easy to use , bright , ami_da_4
D 587.43 so I like this one lot for our design . ami_da_9
D 592.78 I think something like that would be good . ami_da_9
A 594.84 Wow . ami_da_1
C 594.89 Yeah , I m I mean the one thing I think about about these ones is these kl secured areas , I have seen a lot of them with the the cover missing . ami_da_9
D 595.18 Of course yellow . ami_da_9
D 608.0 Right ami_da_9
D 608.0 , yeah . ami_da_9
C 608.22 So like have it hinge rather than sort of clip on or whatever . ami_da_6
D 610.12 Yeah , that is true . ami_da_9
D 611.28 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 612.58 so maybe that could be built into one of the things and it comes up on the TV or something . ami_da_6
D 618.57 And this one , the over sized one , ami_da_4
D 618.57 I do not know about you , but I think it is a bit too gimmicky . ami_da_9
D 624.04 I do not think that will sell very well . ami_da_9
C 624.57 Yeah . ami_da_9
C 625.73 I mean is that not sort of to assist the blind or something , is it ? ami_da_5
C 625.73 Strange . ami_da_9
D 629.8 I guess so . ami_da_4
D 630.81 I do not know . ami_da_4
D 631.91 I think that is a bit ami_da_3
D 631.91 Yeah exactly . ami_da_9
A 632.25 Then d blind do not watch TV . ami_da_4
C 635.31 No they do , they do . ami_da_4
C 636.42 They listen to it . ami_da_4
A 636.62 They do ? ami_da_5
A 636.62 The LCD and the other stuff ami_da_5
A 636.62 , I think . ami_da_3
C 637.35 Yeah . ami_da_4
D 637.47 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 638.72 And this one is just pointing out . ami_da_2
D 643.12 I like some of these things the the raised symbols and everything , ami_da_9
D 643.12 but pointing out that this one the volume it is kind of pressing down , but it would actually go up , because of the shape . ami_da_4
C 654.37 Right , okay . ami_da_1
D 654.92 So that could ami_da_2
D 654.92 that is a bit confusing . ami_da_4
D 657.31 but the buttons on this I think are ami_da_2
D 657.31 it is just showing you how you can have different different buttons . ami_da_4
D 665.23 They do not have to be all the same . ami_da_4
D 667.18 So that is quite cool . ami_da_9
C 668.57 Okay ami_da_1
C 668.57 but people tend to recognise certain shapes to do certain things anyway , do not they ? ami_da_9
C 668.57 Brilliant . ami_da_9
D 672.68 Yeah , exactly . ami_da_9
D 674.17 F five . ami_da_16
D 676.3 Yes . ami_da_9
D 678.04 So there are some of the findings . ami_da_4
D 679.16 So we need to combine those ones ami_da_6
D 679.16 and I have just got an e mail from our technical department saying that they have broken through with some new speech recognition software that you can program in . ami_da_4
C 694.16 That is handy . ami_da_9
D 694.5 yeah it is , just in time , very handy . ami_da_9
D 697.46 so ami_da_2
D 697.46 I think maybe incorporating that in our design would be good . ami_da_6
D 702.54 It is ami_da_2
D 702.54 you program it like you say , record , and then , play , and then , record , play machine , and stuff like that , ami_da_4
D 702.54 so that is ami_da_3
D 702.54 And it is much ami_da_3
D 702.54 Yeah . ami_da_9
C 702.91 Okay . ami_da_1
D 714.69 So that is quite cool . ami_da_9
D 716.68 personal preferences just some imagination , the raised symbols I thought were good , the LCD ami_da_9
D 716.68 , it does look smart , but I think maybe for our budget , ami_da_9
D 716.68 do you think that would be a bit too expensive to have the ami_da_5
D 716.68 Yeah . ami_da_4
D 734.21 And the speech recognition , because I think we are definitely going for the speech recognition , ami_da_4
D 734.21 are we ? ami_da_5
D 734.21 Uh huh . ami_da_1
B 737.64 But in our market survey we have seen that people are willing to pay more , but they want the quality , they want f fancy look , they want some new design , something new . ami_da_4
C 746.4 Okay . ami_da_1
D 746.74 Uh huh . ami_da_9
B 747.19 yeah . ami_da_9
D 747.23 But our budget , we have ami_da_9
D 747.23 Yeah . ami_da_9
C 747.7 It is still it is still got to get within our twelve fifty , you know . ami_da_9
B 748.93 Yeah . ami_da_9
B 749.64 So even if we increase our cost little bit , within some limits , and we give something new technological advancement as well as new design with fancy outlook , I think we will meet the requirements and we will be able to have a good sales in the market . ami_da_9
D 761.01 Uh huh . ami_da_1
D 766.18 Okay . ami_da_9
D 767.89 I am not sure if the if for twenty five Euros per twelve Euros fifty m manufacturing cost , . ami_da_9
C 768.05 Okay . ami_da_1
A 768.56 Ben bana ami_da_3
C 773.28 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 775.46 I ca not see tha ami_da_9
C 775.46 Although , th I mean to be to be sure they have got ami_da_9
C 775.46 I mean they are going crazy with the LCD technology now , ami_da_9
C 775.46 so that you have got your LCD TVs and everything ami_da_4
C 775.46 so maybe the small ami_da_3
C 775.46 But I mean like I I the black and white , I guess , it just does not look funky enough . ami_da_9
D 777.08 The LCD . ami_da_3
D 786.36 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 791.32 No . ami_da_1
C 791.44 but , I mean , like even mobile phones or whatever have now have colour LCD screens , ami_da_4
C 791.44 w I ju ami_da_2
C 791.44 I mean ami_da_2
C 791.44 I would not know about the costs of them . ami_da_4
D 797.41 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 797.88 S ami_da_1
D 797.88 Uh huh . ami_da_1
A 801.89 But price price not withstanding , is it too complicated , is it going to be too much just overload ? ami_da_11
A 801.89 But but the thing is when you use a remote control , you never look at it , ami_da_9
A 801.89 right ? ami_da_11
A 801.89 You are looking at the TV ami_da_9
A 801.89 and and it is ami_da_2
A 801.89 It just seems kind of like a a needless th ami_da_9
A 801.89 So which vegetable ? ami_da_8
A 801.89 Okay . ami_da_1
C 802.05 Twelve fifty . ami_da_16
B 802.22 And the ami_da_3
B 802.22 i it will be easy because there will be , on LCD s screen , there will be different frent icons , they can just click ok ami_da_9
B 802.22 okay , ami_da_9
B 802.22 whatever they wa ami_da_9
B 802.22 yeah . ami_da_1
D 808.48 Yeah , that is the thing , ami_da_9
D 808.48 because ami_da_3
D 808.48 Yeah . ami_da_9
C 809.55 Possibly . ami_da_9
C 820.0 Yeah . ami_da_9
C 821.85 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 821.91 That is true , yeah . ami_da_9
D 825.7 And one of the survey findings was that they want it easy to use , so I think I am not sure about the LCD . ami_da_9
C 829.36 Right . ami_da_1
D 831.44 It is a it is great , it is a good idea , but for our budget and for the thing we are trying to go for eas easy to use , it is not the thing we should go for , I think . ami_da_9
D 840.29 Child friendly ami_da_9
D 840.29 , I thought this was good , ami_da_9
D 840.29 as you pointed out the the bit , it often goes missing especially with children , ami_da_4
D 840.29 but it is a good shape ami_da_9
D 840.29 and the organic is kind of ami_da_3
D 840.29 we could make a vegetabley kind of round shape , I think . ami_da_6
C 856.39 Yeah . ami_da_9
C 856.59 Well I mean we could make a ami_da_3
C 856.59 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 857.13 Yeah , I know , carrot . ami_da_6
C 858.6 Well , si since we are going for the the k the sort of company colours , I think your lemon was not that far ami_da_9
C 858.6 s ami_da_9
C 858.6 And if it does not work you know , we have just made a lemon . ami_da_9
A 863.32 The the lemon . ami_da_9
D 863.97 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 864.45 Well what are the options ? ami_da_8
A 864.45 Oh . ami_da_16
D 866.23 But we do not want it to be ami_da_3
D 866.23 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 868.49 the child friendly , yeah . ami_da_4
D 870.32 Easy to use , it seems quite easy to use . ami_da_9
D 871.86 I like the d the different shapes of the buttons and stuff . ami_da_9
D 874.49 I think that is a good idea to go for . ami_da_9
C 874.74 I like I like the colourful buttons as well . ami_da_9
D 876.92 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 877.49 And the mouse one , I thought it was a good idea , ami_da_9
D 877.49 because people use mo mice mouses now with the scrolling thing . ami_da_4
C 884.12 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 885.48 I mean we are marketing to ami_da_4
C 885.48 sort of twenty five to thirty five , so most people will have come in contact with that kind of use . ami_da_4
D 888.63 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 892.94 S ami_da_9
D 892.94 yeah . ami_da_9
D 894.55 So they would be able to use that , ami_da_9
D 894.55 as I said I think i I would presume it would come up on the screen . ami_da_4
C 898.71 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 899.18 so there you go . ami_da_4
C 900.75 And that means tha that means you get to bump that bit to the TV maker , so ami_da_4
C 900.75 Okay . ami_da_1
D 904.7 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 906.98 So that is the user interface design . ami_da_4
D 914.67 So okay , I will take this out now then . ami_da_7
A 914.68 Okay . ami_da_1
A 925.63 so ami_da_2
A 925.63 I guess there are a lot of options that we are going to have to choose from among , ami_da_4
A 925.63 and I will I will give you the , I guess , technical considerations for those . ami_da_7
D 926.53 There you go . ami_da_16
C 933.54 Yeah , looks like it . ami_da_9
C 943.64 Yeah , I was just thinking the self same thing . ami_da_9
A 949.19 And I am going to use the whiteboard , ami_da_7
A 949.19 just because we have not used it . ami_da_4
A 953.33 Right . ami_da_2
A 953.81 So , ami_da_2
A 953.81 the way I am going to do this is we are going to take a look at some old remote controls , see how they work , reuse the the vital kind of essential pieces of it , and then we will throw in our new innovations and keep it all within budget . ami_da_6
A 973.91 So yeah , looking inside a a very simple remote control . ami_da_4
C 974.63 Magic man . ami_da_14
A 979.43 this is what they sent me . ami_da_4
A 982.4 Okay . ami_da_4
A 982.55 Here is the competition , I suppose . ami_da_4
A 986.0 you open it up , there is a circuit board inside , and there is a a chip , a processor , the TA one one eight three five , which receives input from the buttons , ami_da_4
A 986.0 and ch ami_da_3
A 986.0 Right , ami_da_4
A 986.0 it is very ami_da_2
A 986.0 they are very cheap remote . ami_da_4
C 998.74 So this is a standard off the shelf kind of a chip , is it ? ami_da_5
C 998.74 Right . ami_da_1
A 1003.0 This remote costs nothing , you know . ami_da_4
A 1005.63 so that takes a signals from the buttons and translates it into a sequence of pulses that it then sends to the to the amplifier , which is made of some transistors and amplifiers , op amps , and then that gets sent to the to the LED light , which I can kind of see is that little red light bulb at the end , and that sends out the infrared light signal to the television . ami_da_4
A 1034.59 Oh here it is . ami_da_4
A 1036.61 so this is kind of the the bear essentials that we need to have in our remote control , ami_da_4
A 1036.61 because it it defines the ami_da_3
A 1036.61 R ami_da_4
A 1036.61 no ami_da_4
A 1036.61 , I mean this is a very old one , so now with the new technology ami_da_4
A 1036.61 this is a a minimally small and cheap thing to make . ami_da_4
C 1040.98 Okay . ami_da_9
C 1042.46 So can we make them to pretty much any size we like or is there a minimum or ? ami_da_5
C 1042.46 They gotta be ami_da_3
C 1042.46 Almost a key ring . ami_da_9
A 1055.11 Right . ami_da_2
A 1055.59 So this is what we need to have for certain . ami_da_4
C 1059.32 Okay . ami_da_1
A 1060.31 So you know , as we said , we got the outer casing , ami_da_4
A 1060.31 which we have to decide , you know , what is it going to be , ami_da_6
A 1060.31 the board we have to use basically the same set up , processor , we will probably use the more advanced processor than they had , amplifier and transmitter are all standard . ami_da_4
A 1077.73 so for the casing , this an e mail I got from our manufacturing team , you know , we have a bunch of options from wood , titanium , rubber , plastic , whatnot , latex , double curved , curved . ami_da_4
A 1095.89 So lots of choices , ami_da_4
A 1095.89 what do we think ? ami_da_8
A 1095.89 or sponge , I guess , is not on there , right . ami_da_4
C 1096.18 Okay . ami_da_1
C 1099.32 Well . ami_da_2
A 1101.56 Organic sponge . ami_da_4
C 1101.57 Well , I mean like la latex has a kind of spongy feeling to it , ami_da_9
C 1101.57 does not it . ami_da_11
D 1102.14 I am not sure about the sponge . ami_da_9
C 1105.61 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 1105.7 yeah , it is very elasticy for sure . ami_da_9
D 1108.0 Yeah . ami_da_9
C 1108.31 And that would k also give it kind of durability ami_da_9
C 1108.31 and ami_da_3
C 1108.31 and ther that is also f sorta relatively cheap to cast . ami_da_9
D 1111.48 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 1115.32 Yeah ami_da_9
A 1115.32 so ami_da_3
A 1115.32 Okay so , here are a a plastic , latex ami_da_4
A 1115.32 Oh right . ami_da_9
C 1115.9 so maybe s a sort of plastic initial plastic with a a latex kind of sheath ? ami_da_6
C 1115.9 Oh right ami_da_9
C 1115.9 , okay . ami_da_9
D 1129.01 I like the rubber ami_da_9
D 1129.01 , the stress balls , I think , you know , that could be a bit of a gimmick like it is good to hold ami_da_9
D 1129.01 and ami_da_9
D 1129.01 Yeah . ami_da_9
C 1134.68 I do not know what that stuff is . ami_da_4
A 1137.03 So something with give to it . ami_da_9
C 1138.63 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 1139.77 Okay . ami_da_9
D 1140.56 And that might be quite durable and easy to chuck around . ami_da_4
A 1140.63 And ami_da_3
A 1140.63 and the colour is yellow , right ? ami_da_5
A 1140.63 Yellow , okay . ami_da_9
D 1144.36 Yeah , ami_da_4
D 1144.36 y yellow incorporated , yeah . ami_da_9
C 1144.99 Or at least incorporating , yeah . ami_da_4
C 1149.92 I mean I forgot ami_da_3
C 1149.92 i ami_da_3
C 1149.92 we are sort of ami_da_3
C 1149.92 I do not know what other standard silver kind of Other parts or ami_da_4
D 1154.93 I think ami_da_3
D 1160.26 Yeah , the buttons w like , because there is going to be the the cover the the rubber or the plastic casing and then the buttons in probably two different colours ami_da_4
D 1160.26 or i if we are having buttons actually , ami_da_9
D 1160.26 I don ami_da_3
D 1160.26 Yeah . ami_da_11
A 1170.24 Mm' kay . ami_da_1
A 1172.08 So yellow for the body , ami_da_9
A 1172.08 and then what colour for the buttons ? ami_da_8
A 1172.08 So multi coloured buttons . ami_da_9
C 1177.9 I quite like the multi coloured buttons myself . ami_da_6
D 1182.84 You do have ones like play could be green or on and off is red , and stuff like that , ami_da_4
D 1182.84 yeah . ami_da_4
C 1188.32 Yeah ami_da_9
C 1188.32 or yeah a limit maybe even just a limited multi colour ami_da_6
C 1188.32 so it it does not look too childish , perhaps . ami_da_6
D 1189.72 Makes it easy to use . ami_da_4
D 1193.76 Yeah , that is true , because that blue one did look quite hardish . ami_da_9
C 1197.03 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 1198.6 Okay . ami_da_1
C 1198.75 Although I mean this also comes to shape as well . ami_da_9
C 1201.48 I mean if we are going to make it a novel ami_da_9
C 1201.48 I mean double curved sounds good to me if we are talking about sorta ergonomic and easy use , a bit comfier , you know . ami_da_9
A 1206.34 Okay . ami_da_1
D 1208.84 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 1210.88 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 1211.51 okay ami_da_8
A 1211.51 so the shape we want to go how exactly ? ami_da_8
A 1211.51 Maybe double What about a banana ? ami_da_6
A 1211.51 Yeah ? ami_da_1
A 1211.51 Okay , like we could have a big banana shaped remote control , ami_da_6
A 1211.51 because it is yellow fruit , ami_da_4
A 1211.51 right ? ami_da_11
A 1211.51 Oh i it does not matter which end you point , I guess . ami_da_4
D 1219.72 Like an hour glass kind of figure , ami_da_6
D 1219.72 is that what you are thinking of , ami_da_11
D 1219.72 or just like a It is not ami_da_3
D 1219.72 Yeah . ami_da_9
C 1223.61 Yeah it is , yeah , that that would be that is sort of comfortable to hold , easy to hold ami_da_9
C 1223.61 so you do not drop it . ami_da_9
D 1232.29 We could make novelty remote controls . ami_da_6
C 1234.4 Well , yeah , ami_da_9
C 1234.4 I mean like ami_da_3
C 1234.4 Yeah , ami_da_9
C 1234.4 yeah . ami_da_9
C 1240.78 and a lemon might be a little hard to grip . ami_da_9
D 1241.01 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 1242.54 But then how would you point it ? ami_da_5
D 1242.54 How would you point it ? ami_da_5
D 1242.54 What ami_da_3
D 1242.54 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 1244.15 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 1249.56 We could have a little LEDs on each end . ami_da_6
C 1251.99 They only cost pennies . ami_da_4
B 1253.59 Yeah , I appreciate this idea , because then this this will help us in our advertisement also and we can relate with fruits and vegetables , the people is choices . ami_da_9
B 1264.21 That what our data shows that , ami_da_4
B 1264.21 so this w this w ami_da_3
B 1264.21 the fashion trend shows that fruits and vegetables , ami_da_4
B 1264.21 like people now ami_da_3
B 1264.21 Spongy . ami_da_9
C 1267.93 Huh ? ami_da_16
D 1268.13 y I am ami_da_9
D 1268.13 I am not sure about the banana idea . ami_da_9
A 1272.07 So a spongy banana re Yeah . ami_da_9
D 1273.89 Rubber banana . ami_da_9
C 1275.04 I mean that that th ami_da_3
C 1275.04 does ami_da_2
C 1275.04 it does seem a bit again childish maybe . ami_da_9
D 1278.36 Okay . ami_da_9
D 1281.89 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 1282.48 Okay , okay . ami_da_9
D 1283.14 I think maybe just draw on the kind of fruit and vegetable shape . ami_da_6
D 1288.18 And what else did you say about fashions ? ami_da_5
D 1288.18 What was trendy ? ami_da_5
D 1288.18 And spongy , yeah . ami_da_9
C 1292.55 S ami_da_3
C 1292.55 And sponginess . ami_da_4
A 1294.71 See ami_da_3
A 1294.71 So maybe an an unidentifiable fruit or fiable fruit or vegetable like so it would have a stem perhaps ami_da_6
A 1294.71 and a ami_da_3
A 1294.71 maybe a it would be s axially symmetric . ami_da_6
D 1299.3 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 1300.52 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 1304.21 Maybe , yeah . ami_da_9
C 1306.69 Huh . ami_da_1
D 1307.52 Like what is what is that , ami_da_5
D 1307.52 I do not even know the name of it , some kind of , you know where it is like looks like a little snowman kind of thing . ami_da_4
D 1314.48 I do not know the name of that . ami_da_4
A 1315.87 So it would look like this kind of . ami_da_11
D 1317.36 Yeah , that is what I was thinking . ami_da_9
A 1318.63 Like a gourd almost , or a squash of some sort ? ami_da_5
A 1318.63 Yeah , ami_da_9
A 1318.63 and it has a a clear top and bottom ami_da_4
A 1318.63 so y ami_da_4
A 1318.63 so you could say , you know , it transmits from this end . ami_da_4
D 1319.84 Yeah , maybe that is what they are . ami_da_4
D 1323.17 Because that you can hold it in like the bottom bit ami_da_4
D 1323.17 and ami_da_3
D 1323.17 Yeah . ami_da_9
C 1331.49 Yeah , why the hell not . ami_da_9
C 1333.01 Let is ami_da_3
C 1333.01 that will make us fifty million Euros . ami_da_9
D 1333.88 I do not know . ami_da_9
D 1334.83 What do you guy ami_da_11
D 1334.83 What do you think ? ami_da_11
D 1334.83 No . ami_da_9
C 1338.07 Well , ami_da_2
C 1338.07 I guess it is kind of dra ami_da_3
C 1338.07 you do not necessarily have to have it sort of clearly identified as a fruit just to have that kind of fruitish shape , ami_da_6
C 1338.07 yeah ? ami_da_11
C 1338.07 Yeah , we can relate it by advertising or ami_da_6
C 1338.07 Yeah . ami_da_2
A 1346.04 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 1346.31 Yeah . ami_da_9
B 1347.36 Yeah , then only we can relate it with something . ami_da_9
B 1351.29 Yeah . ami_da_9
B 1352.42 Exactly . ami_da_9
A 1352.5 Okay , so double curved , single curved , what do we feel ? ami_da_11
A 1352.5 Okay . ami_da_1
B 1357.69 Or we can do something , we can design two three shapes and we can have a public survey , let the public choose what they want . ami_da_6
D 1363.78 Uh huh . ami_da_1
C 1364.71 There is a good man . ami_da_9
C 1365.61 There is a good idea . ami_da_9
D 1366.4 Okay . ami_da_9
A 1367.01 Okay , I guess , since you are the marketing guy . ami_da_6
B 1369.66 Yeah , sure . ami_da_7
A 1370.72 We will ami_da_3
A 1370.72 Okay , we could do that . ami_da_9
B 1370.73 I will be happy to do that . ami_da_7
D 1374.45 Okay . ami_da_1
D 1375.7 And buttons would , did we say ? ami_da_8
D 1375.7 different shapes of buttons ? ami_da_8
C 1381.35 I l ami_da_2
C 1381.35 I su ami_da_2
C 1381.35 I mean for the specific functions , you know , up and down , play , stop . ami_da_6
A 1389.28 Okay , so ami_da_2
A 1389.28 so buttons . ami_da_9
C 1389.61 They have got , I mean , they have got standard sort of intuitive things that are always used . ami_da_4
A 1397.12 Okay , just like that . ami_da_11
D 1400.05 Yeah . ami_da_9
C 1400.5 That is cool . ami_da_9
C 1401.05 I like it . ami_da_9
A 1403.51 Okay . ami_da_1
A 1404.85 With the scroll wheel or no ? ami_da_11
A 1404.85 Okay ami_da_9
A 1404.85 I could put the microphone here . ami_da_7
D 1406.37 Yeah , what about the scroll wheel and speech recognition ? ami_da_11
C 1409.09 speech recognition , I think , ami_da_9
C 1409.09 so we need a microphone presumably . ami_da_4
A 1419.25 Okay there is the microphone . ami_da_4
C 1420.39 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 1421.97 Where should I put the microphone ? ami_da_8
A 1421.97 Okay , well we can do some user test with scroll wheels , right ? ami_da_6
A 1421.97 Okay . ami_da_1
C 1422.29 I mean ho h h wel ami_da_2
C 1422.29 are we sure that scroll wheel does give ease of use ? ami_da_11
C 1422.29 Glad , we are not doing this for real . ami_da_9
D 1426.48 Yeah , I am not sure . ami_da_9
D 1428.36 I mean those ideas I saw were just for inspiration , I think . ami_da_4
D 1433.43 yeah , ami_da_2
D 1433.43 I can ami_da_2
D 1433.43 no I am not sure . ami_da_9
D 1437.57 I couldn ami_da_3
D 1437.57 Yeah . ami_da_9
C 1441.03 Yeah . ami_da_9
C 1442.74 And I think if this this new software for the sound recognition is the microphone ami_da_4
C 1442.74 I would put it sort of sub centrally , so it is ami_da_6
C 1442.74 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 1446.9 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 1447.12 Okay . ami_da_9
A 1447.89 So should the microphone be just anywhere on it or ami_da_8
A 1447.89 Okay there is the mic . ami_da_9
D 1454.98 Yeah . ami_da_9
C 1456.52 So it can be sort of held and w ami_da_4
C 1456.52 We really need really going to need to hold it , if it is going to be voice recognition . ami_da_4
D 1457.15 That is cool . ami_da_9
A 1465.43 n well we can ami_da_3
A 1465.43 Whoops . ami_da_16
C 1469.43 Oops . ami_da_16
D 1476.82 So let is not use the whiteboard any more . ami_da_6
A 1479.41 Yeah . ami_da_9
C 1487.57 Upsidaisy . ami_da_16
A 1489.98 Oops , sorry . ami_da_14
A 1491.56 Okay . ami_da_9
D 1492.2 And so what else was there ? ami_da_5
D 1492.2 the ami_da_2
D 1492.2 What about the glow in the dark thing , the strip around it ? ami_da_11
D 1492.2 Are we just going to leave that ? ami_da_8
D 1492.2 You still like it . ami_da_9
C 1499.5 I s I still like it . ami_da_9
C 1501.27 but that is me . ami_da_9
D 1503.8 Because we have got the technological innovation with the speech recognition system . ami_da_4
A 1508.32 Right . ami_da_1
C 1509.36 Yes , or maybe it is just going a bit too far . ami_da_9
C 1511.69 I mean we are pushing it probably with funny fruit shapes . ami_da_9
D 1513.33 Because it could ami_da_3
D 1513.33 Yeah . ami_da_9
C 1516.02 do not want to sort of overkill . ami_da_9
D 1517.71 Especially with yellow . ami_da_9
D 1520.62 I dunno . ami_da_9
C 1521.92 Because I mean like if we ami_da_2
C 1521.92 I mean how good is the speech recognition thing ? ami_da_5
C 1521.92 Do we want to go for buttons at all , ami_da_11
C 1521.92 do we want to just have a device that maybe sits and pretends it is a fruit ? ami_da_6
C 1521.92 Yeah , ami_da_9
C 1521.92 you know , and then you just tal ami_da_2
C 1521.92 I mean like everybody is got fruit bowl in front of the telly . ami_da_4
D 1532.94 Then you put it in the fruit bowl ? ami_da_11
A 1535.63 They can work from a ami_da_2
A 1535.63 You do not have to hold it . ami_da_4
A 1538.63 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 1543.42 I it could even encourage healthier habits for television watchers , ami_da_9
A 1543.42 you know they have fruits all round them . ami_da_4
D 1546.74 Yeah . ami_da_9
C 1547.25 Yeah . ami_da_9
C 1548.17 Make them make them think of fruit , yeah . ami_da_9
A 1549.5 Now just make sure they do not eat the remote . ami_da_14
B 1550.68 Yeah . ami_da_9
C 1552.6 I mean some ami_da_2
C 1552.6 I ami_da_2
C 1552.6 l like think of a fruit that could sit sort of independently on its own like , I dunno , an apple . ami_da_6
D 1554.42 Yeah , do we need buttons ? ami_da_11
C 1561.62 Then it is just apple so sort of ami_da_3
C 1561.62 , yellow apples though . ami_da_9
A 1563.96 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 1565.62 I quite like the shape . ami_da_9
D 1566.9 I quite like the design of that , ami_da_9
D 1566.9 because that could sit on its own and it is quite got a quite steady base . ami_da_4
C 1571.72 Yeah . ami_da_9
C 1572.72 Okay , ami_da_9
C 1572.72 yeah , that is good . ami_da_9
C 1575.47 Groovy . ami_da_9
A 1575.7 Okay . ami_da_3
D 1575.8 and as we say we n we do not want to be too ridiculous with the fruit things you know . ami_da_9
A 1576.78 But yeah ami_da_3
A 1576.78 But yeah , about the speech thing , it does not have to be hand held or close . ami_da_4
C 1580.65 Yeah , . ami_da_9
A 1585.15 It can sit at a distance and pick it up still . ami_da_4
C 1586.85 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 1586.88 Okay . ami_da_1
C 1587.13 So I mean like you could actually ami_da_3
C 1587.13 Yeah , gives you the options . ami_da_9
B 1591.38 Or we can ami_da_2
B 1591.38 we can do one thing , we can just have a remote control and casings of different different shapes , different fruit shapes in such a way that a any casing can be could be fit into this mobile general piece . ami_da_6
B 1606.94 So whatever people want , like if somebody want it in banana shape , we will put that casing onto that mobile phone , okay , ami_da_6
B 1606.94 it will look l ami_da_3
B 1606.94 yeah . ami_da_9
C 1613.33 So a selection of casings . ami_da_9
D 1616.84 Yeah , ami_da_9
D 1616.84 because you said about disposable , ami_da_4
D 1616.84 did not you ? ami_da_5
D 1616.84 You said about disposable earli people want disposable things ami_da_4
D 1616.84 so we could do that , like have a choice . ami_da_6
B 1616.87 In that w ami_da_3
B 1616.87 S s sorry ? ami_da_12
B 1616.87 like if this is a like if this is a mobile phone we will design casing in such a way like half of , we need not to have a full cover , we will just have a half of cover , ami_da_4
B 1616.87 okay ? ami_da_12
B 1616.87 If somebody wants it i in banana shape , we will fit banana shape casing onto that , so it will give a banana shape look . ami_da_4
C 1616.89 It kind of fi it fits with f fits with marketing ami_da_9
C 1616.89 Like like mobiles , ami_da_9
C 1616.89 yeah . ami_da_9
D 1633.09 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 1636.48 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 1642.47 If somebody wanted in apple shape we will design that , we will put we will put apple shape casing on that . ami_da_4
B 1649.06 It will give apple shape look . ami_da_4
D 1650.81 Okay . ami_da_1
B 1650.82 So in that way you can have any , that means whatever you want , ami_da_4
B 1650.82 without yeah . ami_da_3
D 1654.47 Okay . ami_da_9
D 1655.22 We still need the buttons in the same places thought , ami_da_4
D 1655.22 do not we ? ami_da_5
D 1655.22 Oh , that is the other side . ami_da_9
B 1658.22 Yeah , ami_da_9
B 1658.22 button will be on the upper side , buttons will be the on the upper side . ami_da_4
C 1659.06 You can standardise those , ami_da_4
C 1659.06 I mean . ami_da_3
B 1662.43 Yeah , buttons will be on the upper side , lower side we will just put the casing , so half of that will be look the Yeah , not not the upper side . ami_da_4
D 1662.99 Oh , okay . ami_da_9
D 1667.97 Oh , half a fruit . ami_da_9
D 1669.17 Oh , okay , okay . ami_da_9
B 1670.83 So from lower you can , ami_da_2
B 1670.83 it means while you are holding of from this side ami_da_4
B 1670.83 you c ami_da_4
B 1670.83 you can have banana look or apple look , whatever . ami_da_4
D 1677.1 Okay , okay . ami_da_9
B 1678.35 So in that way we need not to d have different different shape mobiles everything , we will just design casings fruit shape . ami_da_4
D 1685.96 Okay . ami_da_9
A 1686.07 Yeah yeah . ami_da_9
C 1686.23 I think tho I think if you are going to have a facia then you would want to have it so that it does go over the buttons , ami_da_9
C 1686.23 because when ami_da_2
C 1686.23 if you think about it if they are wanting it , because they want to look at it , if they are using it , and what they want to look at is facing away from them . ami_da_9
B 1686.33 And ami_da_3
B 1686.33 Yeah , . ami_da_9
C 1699.37 It does not really ami_da_9
C 1699.37 You know because that would be in the palm of their hand and they would not be able to see it , ami_da_4
C 1699.37 unless you have sort of you got the buttons options on one side , and you get the facia on the other side with a microphone so that you can place it face down . ami_da_6
D 1705.08 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 1714.85 And you have got the facia , and you can just talk at the ami_da_6
C 1714.85 Maybe . ami_da_9
A 1724.13 Okay , so ami_da_2
A 1724.13 Yeah , ami_da_9
A 1724.13 s I guess we decided on material , ami_da_4
A 1724.13 right ? ami_da_5
A 1724.13 So that that spongy latex rubber everything feel , and the colours we got down , ami_da_4
A 1724.13 and the shape , maybe we will just make it kind of mix and match type of shape or ami_da_6
A 1724.13 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 1727.48 So you have narrowed it down to half a dozen options . ami_da_9
D 1736.5 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 1737.97 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 1740.21 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 1740.56 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 1744.24 Well , because ami_da_2
D 1744.24 Well , I I am not sure if we should go so far in the whole fruit thing , ami_da_9
D 1744.24 because I think we should maybe just take the inspiration from the fruit ami_da_6
D 1744.24 and because what ami_da_3
D 1744.24 Yeah , ami_da_9
D 1744.24 w I think wh wha would ami_da_2
D 1744.24 we are trying to get to twenty five , thirty five year olds who want it quite trendy as well they said . ami_da_4
C 1753.46 Okay , ami_da_9
C 1753.46 so we stick with what we have got there . ami_da_6
D 1761.74 They wanted something that looks fancy ami_da_4
D 1761.74 and I think maybe fruit could be a bit of a too much of a gimmick , ami_da_9
D 1761.74 but something ergonomically shaped and organic , like good to hold , based on fruits and natural things like that , ami_da_6
D 1761.74 because al already we are going a bit gaudy with the yellow , you know . ami_da_9
C 1775.79 okay . ami_da_9
D 1781.6 I mean we could make it nice pale yellow . ami_da_6
C 1783.95 Well , it is kind of gotta be our company is yellow . ami_da_4
D 1786.0 Okay . ami_da_9
A 1787.8 Okay . ami_da_1
D 1788.15 Okay . ami_da_1
C 1788.17 So again I mean like we could have , I mean , we could quite easily have the the main body be a different ami_da_6
C 1788.17 colour , but have ami_da_3
C 1788.17 kind of going round , yeah . ami_da_9
D 1793.68 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 1794.32 Maybe we could have that pale yellow and then an outside bit bright yellow with , you said , the logan the slogan . ami_da_6
D 1802.64 Because ami_da_3
D 1802.64 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 1802.92 I mean e even if ami_da_2
C 1802.92 I mean not necessarily that the the whole body has to be of the company colour , ami_da_4
C 1802.92 so you know blue and yellow tend to go to we well together . ami_da_9
C 1813.63 So you have the main body blue with the yellow logo and slogan running up one side of it kind of thing . ami_da_6
D 1818.56 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 1819.53 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 1821.19 Uh huh . ami_da_1
C 1821.87 W sort of ami_da_3
C 1821.87 It is I think it is basically the more you move ami_da_4
C 1821.87 i ami_da_4
C 1821.87 it , it is got a wee thing inside that just kind of powers it . ami_da_4
A 1823.78 Great . ami_da_9
A 1825.01 as for the energy source , you know , almost every remote control uses just batteries , but we do not have to be limited by that . ami_da_4
A 1833.27 We can use a hand dynamo . ami_da_4
A 1835.81 I do not know what that means , ami_da_4
A 1835.81 we crank it ? ami_da_5
A 1835.81 Right , it is like those watches that you c ami_da_9
A 1835.81 So , this might be an idea for something that people really want to grab , you can shake it if it is out of power . ami_da_9
C 1843.48 yeah . ami_da_9
D 1844.77 Oh , a d a dynamo ? ami_da_5
D 1844.77 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 1850.56 Yeah , like with those watches that you kind of twist . ami_da_9
C 1850.86 Yeah , I like that , ami_da_9
C 1850.86 yeah . ami_da_9
C 1852.72 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 1853.3 Yeah that is quite cool . ami_da_9
A 1853.82 Okay . ami_da_4
A 1854.24 So if it if it is not working , I guess people is natural reaction anyway is to just shake the thing . ami_da_4
C 1854.28 Okay . ami_da_1
B 1854.37 But ami_da_3
B 1854.37 But but do you think that it will be a good idea to use dynamo , tha these type of cells ? ami_da_11
B 1854.37 Because then people have to , well like if the cell is out of bat ami_da_4
B 1854.37 Yeah , to ami_da_9
B 1854.37 mo ami_da_1
B 1854.37 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 1856.16 You shake it and scream at it . ami_da_4
C 1858.25 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 1859.08 Yeah , it is , yeah . ami_da_9
C 1867.42 It does leave them with an obligation to Especially if they want to use it sp specifically as voice activated . ami_da_4
B 1874.67 Yeah , ami_da_9
B 1874.67 because most of the people ami_da_3
B 1874.67 Yeah . ami_da_9
C 1875.05 Then if it is just sitting on the ami_da_3
C 1875.05 Okay , okay . ami_da_9
A 1875.3 Right . ami_da_1
D 1875.38 Yeah , then they have to pick it up and then activate it ami_da_9
D 1875.38 and then ami_da_9
D 1875.38 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 1880.23 That is true . ami_da_9
A 1880.64 Okay . ami_da_1
C 1880.95 Right what are the other options ? ami_da_5
C 1880.95 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 1883.32 there is solar power . ami_da_4
B 1885.11 , solar power will w also not be a good idea , ami_da_9
B 1885.11 because then they have to keep m their mobiles outside in solar energy , and the days when there is no sola sunlight ami_da_4
B 1885.11 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 1891.55 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 1894.11 I am I am with Raj on that , ami_da_9
C 1894.11 I think , you know , ami_da_2
C 1894.11 I have got I have got no ami_da_4
C 1894.11 I have got a north facing house , there is not really ever sun coming in my window . ami_da_4
A 1895.8 Okay , so probably just ami_da_3
B 1896.32 Yeah . ami_da_9
B 1897.4 What we w ami_da_3
B 1897.4 yeah . ami_da_1
D 1899.78 But w like just normal light ? ami_da_5
D 1899.78 And we are a very environmentally friendly company , are not we as well ? ami_da_9
D 1899.78 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 1899.9 I think we should a rechargeable battery will be a good idea . ami_da_6
C 1902.28 Oh that is true . ami_da_9
B 1903.87 They can they can recharge it . ami_da_4
C 1905.17 I mean I w ami_da_2
C 1905.17 I w ami_da_2
C 1905.17 that idea that I thought just on the basis of like ridding them of batteries and that kind of bother ami_da_4
C 1905.17 is having a , ami_da_6
C 1905.17 yeah , ami_da_9
C 1905.17 having a rechargeable stand , so that not only it doubles as a stand , but for using it as recharging it , but also for using it as sound recognition . ami_da_6
B 1916.17 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 1919.3 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 1925.67 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 1927.46 Okay . ami_da_1
D 1927.8 Like like a hand ami_da_2
D 1927.8 like one of those portable phones kind of thing . ami_da_9
C 1930.6 Yeah that kind of thing . ami_da_9
B 1930.93 Yeah , that is ami_da_9
B 1930.93 Yeah , exactly . ami_da_9
A 1931.6 Okay . ami_da_1
A 1933.25 So a rechargeable battery . ami_da_6
C 1935.47 Yeah . ami_da_9
B 1935.59 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 1936.32 Okay . ami_da_9
C 1937.39 Rechargeable . ami_da_16
A 1937.45 the user interface , the buttons , I guess we talked about this already . ami_da_4
C 1943.36 What is chip on print ? ami_da_5
C 1943.36 What is ami_da_3
C 1943.36 Sorry , never mind . ami_da_9
A 1945.51 th the ami_da_2
A 1945.51 the electronics , basically the more features we add ami_da_4
A 1945.51 Oops , this one . ami_da_16
A 1956.82 So the more features we add the fancier chips we need to buy and put in , which adds to the cost as you can expect . ami_da_4
A 1968.16 But I think we can keep it all under budget . ami_da_4
A 1972.41 So yes , ami_da_2
A 1972.41 so the speech thing you said our our techno our research and development department came up with some break through . ami_da_4
A 1980.99 So just in time . ami_da_9
C 1981.48 Yeah , ami_da_1
C 1981.48 and if we if we are just having buttons and the speech then we are getting our cheapest option of chipping . ami_da_4
D 1981.59 Just in time . ami_da_9
A 1989.41 Right , right . ami_da_9
C 1990.49 That is good . ami_da_9
