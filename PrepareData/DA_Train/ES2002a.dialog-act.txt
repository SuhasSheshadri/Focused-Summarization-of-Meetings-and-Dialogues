B 151.79 and at this point we get try out the whiteboard over there . ami_da_4
B 159.59 So you get to draw your favourite animal and sum up your favourite characteristics of it . ami_da_4

D 176.12 Okay . ami_da_16
D 185.34 Very nice . ami_da_16
D 186.46 Alright . ami_da_2
D 187.46 My favourite animal is like A beagle . ami_da_4
D 211.97 charac favourite characteristics of it ? ami_da_5
D 211.97 Is that right ? ami_da_5
D 211.97 , right , well basically high priority for any animal for me is that they be willing to take a lot of physical affection from their family . ami_da_4
B 215.95 Yeah . ami_da_4
B 216.6 Yeah . ami_da_4
D 229.16 And , yeah that they have lots of personality and be fit and in robust good health . ami_da_4
D 237.96 So this is blue . ami_da_4
D 239.85 Blue beagle . ami_da_4
D 241.42 My family is beagle . ami_da_4
B 243.4 Right . ami_da_9
B 244.71 Lovely . ami_da_14
C 255.07 Well , my favourite animal would be a monkey . ami_da_4
C 268.0 Then they are small cute and furry , and when planet of the apes becomes real , I am going to be up there with them . ami_da_4
B 275.67 Right . ami_da_1
A 280.75 There is too much gear . ami_da_9
B 285.96 You can take as long over this as you like , ami_da_6
B 285.96 because we have not got an awful lot to discuss . ami_da_4
B 290.31 Ok oh ami_da_9
B 290.31 we do we do ami_da_4
B 291.76 Do not feel like you are in a rush , anyway . ami_da_6
A 293.26 Okay . ami_da_9
D 296.02 I coulda told you a whole lot more about beagles . ami_da_7
B 297.94 Ach why not ami_da_9
B 297.94 We might have to get you up again then . ami_da_6
D 298.03 Boy , let me tell you . ami_da_16
B 301.14 I do not know what mine is . ami_da_4
B 302.11 I am going to have to think on the spot now . ami_da_7
D 307.06 Impressionist . ami_da_4
A 309.38 Ca not draw . ami_da_9
B 312.05 Is that a whale ? ami_da_5
A 313.09 Yeah . ami_da_4
A 318.58 , well anyway , ami_da_2
A 318.58 I do not know , it is just the first animal I can think off the top of my head . ami_da_4
A 325.0 Yes . ami_da_4
A 325.43 Big reason is because I am allergic to most animals . ami_da_4
A 327.86 Allergic to animal fur , so fish was a natural choice . ami_da_4
A 332.03 , yeah , ami_da_2
A 332.03 and I kind of like whales . ami_da_4
A 334.32 They come in and go eat everything in sight . ami_da_4
A 338.22 And they are quite harmless and mild and interesting . ami_da_4
D 338.48 Alright . ami_da_1
B 342.42 Okay . ami_da_9
B 343.63 God , I still do not know what I am going to write about . ami_da_4
D 349.66 Superb sketch , by the way . ami_da_14
A 353.86 Tail is a bit big , I think . ami_da_9
B 354.91 I was going to choose a dog as well . ami_da_4
B 357.54 But I will just draw a different kind of dog . ami_da_7
D 359.62 Yep . ami_da_1
B 360.21 M my favourite animal is my own dog at home . ami_da_4
B 364.23 That does not really look like him , actually . ami_da_9
B 373.3 He looks more like a pig , actually . ami_da_4
B 375.84 well . ami_da_9
D 378.46 I see a dog in there . ami_da_9
B 379.52 Do you ? ami_da_5
B 379.52 Oh that is very good of you . ami_da_14
D 379.99 Yep . ami_da_4
D 382.82 Now I see a rooster . ami_da_14
D 393.42 What kind is it ? ami_da_5
D 393.42 Is he aware that th it is his own cha tail he is chasing ? ami_da_5
B 394.87 he is a mixture of various things . ami_da_4
B 398.71 and what do I like about him , ami_da_16
B 398.71 That is just to suggest that his tail wags . ami_da_4
B 405.71 he is very friendly and cheery and always pleased to see you , and very kind of affectionate ami_da_4
B 405.71 and ami_da_2
B 405.71 and he is quite quite wee as well ami_da_4
B 405.71 so you know he can does not take up too much space . ami_da_4
B 421.48 and And he does a funny thing where he chases his tail as well , ami_da_4
B 421.48 which is quite amusing , so ami_da_9
B 421.48 It is . ami_da_4
B 434.2 I think it is . ami_da_4
B 434.67 He only does it after he is had his dinner and he will just all of a sudden just get up and start chasing his tail around the living room . ami_da_4
A 442.02 It is an after dinner dog then . ami_da_4
B 443.59 Yeah , ami_da_9
B 443.59 so ami_da_2
B 443.59 Yeah , maybe . ami_da_9
D 444.05 Probably when he was little he got lots of attention for doing it and has forever been conditioned . ami_da_4
B 449.0 Maybe . ami_da_9
B 450.7 Right , where did you find this ? ami_da_5
B 450.7 Just down here ? ami_da_5
B 450.7 Yeah . ami_da_5
B 455.51 Okay . ami_da_2
B 458.92 what are we doing next ? . ami_da_16
B 465.51 Okay , we now need to discuss the project finance . ami_da_6
B 470.01 so according to the brief we are going to be selling this remote control for twenty five Euro , and we are aiming to make fifty million Euro . ami_da_4
B 482.77 so we are going to be selling this on an international scale . ami_da_4
B 487.21 And we do not want it to cost any more than twelve fifty Euros , so fifty percent of the selling price . ami_da_4
D 488.56 Okay . ami_da_1
D 496.02 , can we just go over that again ? ami_da_6
D 496.02 , so bas at twel ami_da_12
D 496.02 Alright , yeah . ami_da_9
B 497.99 Sure . ami_da_9
D 503.79 Okay . ami_da_9
D 505.28 So cost like production cost is twelve fifty , ami_da_4
D 505.28 but selling price is is that wholesale or retail ? ami_da_5
D 505.28 Like on the shelf . ami_da_5
B 508.17 All together . ami_da_4
B 515.16 I dunno . ami_da_4
B 516.78 I imagine ami_da_3
B 516.78 That is a good question . ami_da_9
D 518.31 Our sale our sale anyway . ami_da_9
B 519.67 I imagine it probably is our sale actually because it is probably up to the the the retailer to sell it for whatever price they want . ami_da_9
D 520.65 Yeah , okay okay . ami_da_1
D 526.79 Okay . ami_da_1
D 531.58 Alright . ami_da_1
B 531.83 But I I do not know , ami_da_9
B 531.83 I mean do you think the fact that it is going to be sold internationally will have a bearing on how we design it at all ? ami_da_11
B 531.83 Think it will ? ami_da_12
D 538.77 Yes . ami_da_9
D 548.28 Well right away I am wondering if there is th th , like with DVD players , if there are zones . ami_da_4
B 553.78 Oh yeah , regions and stuff , ami_da_9
B 553.78 yeah . ami_da_9
D 554.28 f frequencies or something as well as characters , different keypad styles and s symbols . ami_da_4
B 556.62 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 557.56 Okay . ami_da_1
B 565.13 Yeah . ami_da_9
B 565.93 Well for a remote control , do you think that will be ami_da_3
B 565.93 I suppose it is depends on how complicated our remote control is . ami_da_4
D 568.46 I do not know . ami_da_4
D 571.22 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 571.74 It does make sense from maybe the design point of view because you have more complicated characters like European languages , then you need more buttons . ami_da_4
B 580.42 Yeah , ami_da_9
B 580.42 yeah . ami_da_9
D 580.66 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 581.3 So , possibly . ami_da_9
D 582.33 Yeah . ami_da_2
B 583.04 Okay . ami_da_9
D 583.5 And then a and then al the other thing international is on top of the price . ami_da_4
D 587.78 I am thinking the price might might appeal to a certain market in one region , whereas in another it will be different , so ami_da_4
D 587.78 Just a chara just a characteristic of the Just ami_da_3
D 587.78 Or just like , basic product podi positioning , the twenty five Euro remote control might be a big hit in London , might not be such a big hit in Greece , ami_da_4
D 587.78 who knows , something like that , yeah . ami_da_16
B 597.79 What , just like in terms of like the wealth of the country ? ami_da_5
B 597.79 Like how much money people have to spend on things like ? ami_da_5
B 597.79 Aye , I see what you mean , yeah . ami_da_9
B 619.01 Marketing . ami_da_4
B 620.06 Good marketing thoughts . ami_da_9
D 620.48 Yep . ami_da_9
B 621.09 Oh gosh , ami_da_16
B 621.09 I should be writing all this down . ami_da_7
D 655.45 Right away I am making some kind of assumptions about what what information we are given here , thinking , okay trendy probably means something other than just basic , something other than just standard . ami_da_4
B 665.36 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 668.59 so I am wondering right away , ami_da_4
D 668.59 is selling twenty five Euros , is that sort of the ami_da_3
D 668.59 thi is this going to to be like the premium product kind of thing or ami_da_5
D 668.59 Uh huh . ami_da_1
B 677.15 Yeah , ami_da_9
B 677.15 yeah . ami_da_9
B 677.66 Like how much does , you know , a remote control cost . ami_da_5
B 681.66 Well twenty five Euro , ami_da_4
B 681.66 I mean that is that is about like eighteen pounds or something , ami_da_4
B 681.66 is not it ? ami_da_5
B 681.66 Or no , ami_da_9
B 681.66 is it as much as that ? ami_da_5
B 681.66 Sixteen seventeen eighteen pounds . ami_da_4
D 689.77 Yep . ami_da_1
D 691.16 Yeah , ami_da_9
D 691.16 I would say so , ami_da_4
D 691.16 yeah . ami_da_9
B 692.42 , I dunno , I have never bought a remote control , so I do not know how how good a remote control that would get you . ami_da_4
D 696.23 No . ami_da_1
D 697.98 Yeah , ami_da_1
D 697.98 yeah . ami_da_1
B 702.02 But yeah , I suppose it has to look kind of cool and gimmicky . ami_da_4
B 707.1 right ami_da_2
B 707.1 , okay . ami_da_2
B 711.43 Let me just scoot on ahead here . ami_da_7
B 713.81 Okay . ami_da_2
B 714.96 well d Does anybody have anything to add to to the finance issue at all ? ami_da_5
B 714.96 Thin ami_da_3
B 714.96 No , actually . ami_da_4
D 722.77 Do we have any other background information on like how that compares to other ami_da_5
D 722.77 other ami_da_3
D 722.77 Yeah . ami_da_9
B 728.32 That would be useful , though , ami_da_4
B 728.32 would not it , ami_da_11
B 728.32 if you knew like what your money would get you now . ami_da_4
D 753.67 Yeah , interesting thing about discussing production of a remote control for me is that l ami_da_4
D 753.67 as you point out , ami_da_14
D 753.67 I just do not think of remote controls as somethin something people consciously assess in their purchasing habits . ami_da_4
B 767.69 Yeah , ami_da_1
B 767.69 yeah . ami_da_1
D 767.74 It is just like getting shoelaces with shoes or something . ami_da_4
B 772.01 Oh . ami_da_16
D 772.49 It just comes along . ami_da_4
B 772.8 Five minutes to end of meeting . ami_da_12
B 774.17 Oh , okay . ami_da_9
B 775.33 We are a bit behind . ami_da_4
D 776.12 Do you know what I mean ? ami_da_11
D 776.12 Like so sort of like how do you ami_da_3
D 776.12 I ami_da_4
D 776.12 I mean one one way of looking at it would be , well the people producing television sets , maybe they have to buy remote controls . ami_da_4
C 777.32 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 777.7 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 786.49 Or another way is maybe people who have TV sets are really fed up with their remote control and they really want a better one or something . ami_da_4
C 792.52 I know ami_da_3
C 792.52 My parents went out and bought remote controls because they got fed up of having four or five different remote controls for each things the house . ami_da_4
D 794.53 But ami_da_3
D 794.53 Right . ami_da_9
D 800.71 Right . ami_da_9
C 801.38 So for them it was just how many devices control . ami_da_4
D 801.75 Okay so ami_da_3
D 801.75 Right , ami_da_9
D 801.75 so in function one of the priorities might be to combine as many uses ami_da_4
D 801.75 I think so . ami_da_9
B 806.46 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 811.51 Right , so do you think that should be like a main design aim of our remote control d you know , do your your satellite and your regular telly and your VCR and everything ? ami_da_11
D 815.81 Yeah , ami_da_1
D 815.81 yeah . ami_da_1
D 818.45 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 819.79 Well like , ami_da_2
D 819.79 maybe what we could use is a sort of like a example of a successful other piece technology is palm palm pilots . ami_da_4
D 828.28 They are gone from being just like little sort of scribble boards to cameras , MP three players , telephones , everything , agenda . ami_da_4
D 836.31 So , like , I wonder if we might add something new to the to the remote control market , such as the lighting in your house , or ami_da_4
D 836.31 Yeah , ami_da_1
D 836.31 yeah . ami_da_1
B 840.25 Yeah . ami_da_9
B 843.99 Or even like , you know , notes about what you want to watch . ami_da_4
B 847.62 Like you might put in there ami_da_4
B 847.62 oh I want to watch such and such and look a ami_da_4
B 847.62 Oh that is a good idea . ami_da_9
D 851.06 An ami_da_3
D 851.06 Yeah . ami_da_9
B 851.55 So extra functionalities . ami_da_4
D 853.54 Like , p personally for me , at home I have I have combined the the audio video of my television set and my DVD player and my CD player . ami_da_4
D 862.9 So they w all work actually function together but I have different remote controls for each of them . ami_da_4
D 866.91 So it is sort of ironic that that then they are in there ami_da_9
D 866.91 you know , the sound and everything it is just one system . ami_da_4
D 876.45 But each one is got its own little part . ami_da_4
B 883.05 okay , ami_da_2
B 883.05 I would wel ami_da_3
B 883.05 we are going to have to wrap up pretty quickly in the next couple of minutes . ami_da_4
B 889.88 I will just check we have nothing else ami_da_7
B 891.96 Okay . ami_da_9
B 892.58 so anything else anybody wants to add about what they do not like about remote controls they have used , ami_da_5
B 892.58 what they would really like to be part of this new one at all ? ami_da_8
B 892.58 You keep losing them . ami_da_16
A 903.08 And you keep losing them . ami_da_4
B 905.58 Okay . ami_da_9
A 906.45 Finding them is really a pain , you know . ami_da_4
A 908.59 I mean it is usually quite small , or when you want it right , it slipped behind the couch or it is kicked under the table . ami_da_4
B 913.17 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 913.22 Yeah . ami_da_9
B 914.71 W You get those ones where you can , if you like , whistle or make a really high pitched noise they beep . ami_da_4
D 914.77 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 915.45 You know . ami_da_11
D 916.12 That is just really good ami_da_3
D 916.12 id ami_da_3
D 916.12 Yep . ami_da_1
B 920.04 There ami_da_3
B 920.04 I mean is that something we would want to include , do you think ? ami_da_11
B 920.04 Dunno . ami_da_9
D 924.35 sure . ami_da_9
B 926.64 Okay maybe . ami_da_9
D 927.64 I remember when the first remote control my my family had was on a cable . ami_da_4
D 932.01 Actually had a cable between it and the TV and big like buttons that sort of like , like on a blender or something . ami_da_4
B 937.0 My goodness . ami_da_16
D 937.36 And , you know , ami_da_2
D 937.36 when I think about what they are now , it is better , but actually it is still kind of , ami_da_4
D 937.36 I dunno , like a massive junky thing on the table . ami_da_4
B 946.26 Still feels quite primitive . ami_da_9
D 946.4 Maybe we could think about how , could be more , you know , streamlined . ami_da_6
B 951.41 Maybe like a touch screen or something ? ami_da_6
B 951.41 Okay . ami_da_9
D 951.49 S ami_da_6
D 951.49 Something like that , yeah . ami_da_9
D 954.2 Or whatever would be technologically reasonable . ami_da_4
B 956.36 Uh huh , okay . ami_da_9
B 957.42 Well I guess that is up to our industrial designer . ami_da_6
D 957.54 Because it could b it could it could be that f ami_da_2
D 957.54 it could be that functionally that does not make it any better , but that just the appeal of of not having You know , these days there is a r pe things in people is homes are becoming more and more like chic , you know . ami_da_4
B 962.22 It looks better . ami_da_4
B 969.0 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 969.56 , nicer materials ami_da_4
D 969.56 and might be be worth exploring anyway . ami_da_6
B 971.85 Okay . ami_da_1
B 975.24 Okay . ami_da_1
B 977.17 Right , well ami_da_2
B 977.17 so just to wrap up ami_da_7
B 977.17 the next meeting is going to be in thirty minutes . ami_da_4
B 981.67 So that is about about ten to twelve by my watch . ami_da_4
B 985.49 so inbetween now and then , as the industrial designer , you are going to be working on you know the actual working design of it ami_da_4
B 985.49 so y ami_da_4
B 985.49 you know what you are doing there . ami_da_4
A 993.88 Yep . ami_da_9
B 996.69 for user interface , technical functions , I guess that is you know like what we have been talking about , what it will actually do . ami_da_4
B 1004.08 and marketing executive , you will be just thinking about what it actually what , you know , what requirements it has to has to fulfil ami_da_4
B 1004.08 and you will all get instructions emailed to you , ami_da_4
B 1004.08 I guess . ami_da_4
D 1019.67 Okay . ami_da_9
B 1028.05 Yeah , so it is th the functional design stage is next , I guess . ami_da_4
B 1034.47 And ami_da_2
B 1034.47 and that is the end of the meeting . ami_da_4
B 1039.12 So I got that little message a lot sooner than I thought I would , so ami_da_4
D 1047.17 Before we wrap up , just to make sure we are all on the same page here , ami_da_6
D 1047.17 , do we ami_da_3
D 1047.17 We were given sort of an example of a coffee machine or something , ami_da_4
D 1047.17 right ? ami_da_13
