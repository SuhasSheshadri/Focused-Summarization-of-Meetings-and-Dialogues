D 45.41 Okay . ami_da_12
C 48.68 And do not forget the ami_da_16
C 48.68 I have a copy . ami_da_4
D 50.32 Oh yeah . ami_da_1
A 54.77 , so hi everyone . ami_da_14
A 56.68 Thanks for coming to this meeting . ami_da_14
A 59.36 well as you all know the topic of this morning is meeting is the fact that we are moving and we are going to get more space . ami_da_4
A 69.19 So that is a very good piece of news . ami_da_9
A 71.99 but we also have to find out how we use this space . ami_da_4
A 76.68 So if you want , I will just give a brief overview of what is happening ami_da_7
A 76.68 and then we can talk about , well , arranging these new the new office space . ami_da_6
A 89.99 So in case you have not seen the the documents let me just show you very briefly the the configuration of the the space . ami_da_7
A 103.99 So well , there is nothing much to say . ami_da_4
A 107.5 Well you know how many of us are are present and you know that we are a bit tight actually in our present location . ami_da_4
A 115.54 that is why actually the university finally allocated us this this part of the Unimail building . ami_da_4
A 124.09 So it is at the sixth floor . ami_da_4
A 126.38 And it is sort of contiguous rooms as you you can all see from from here . ami_da_4
A 132.33 so the the the one P , two P , three P means the the number of persons . ami_da_4
A 138.82 As you can see we have several corridor with a number of of of rooms , of one person rooms , two person room and and three person rooms . ami_da_4
A 152.01 actually I think Agnes did this nice drawing ami_da_4
A 152.01 so she even put the the view , so we have the old town on one side , and the mountains on the other two sides . ami_da_4
A 162.95 we have some bathrooms for us . ami_da_4
A 165.96 and a courtyard which actually means a sort of shaft , because the court is down at the first floor . ami_da_4
D 172.96 Andre , just , yeah , just a a clarification question , ami_da_7
D 172.96 are they number of people per room indicated strict , or can we play around with ? ami_da_5
D 172.96 I mean if there are two people , is it really that you ca not put three or two and a half or how how was it calculated ? ami_da_5
D 172.96 Okay . ami_da_1
A 187.49 Well , it is a bit difficult to say , because in fact we have some constraints in terms of furniture . ami_da_4
A 194.02 they are here . ami_da_4
A 195.4 So well , your your person Your your question actually is answered maybe by the third item . ami_da_4
A 201.57 So each person should get , well , it is a sort of desk , it is made of two pieces and it looks like a corner . ami_da_4
A 208.63 With , of course , a chair . ami_da_4
A 210.15 a filing cabinet that goes under the desk ami_da_4
A 210.15 and , well , we can put hanging shelves over the the desks . ami_da_6
A 218.79 So I am not really sure it is possible to get three three desks in a two person office . ami_da_4
A 225.94 But we could try . ami_da_6
A 228.41 What is What should be said here , I do not know if , well , you ami_da_3
A 228.41 I I will maybe distribute now documents if you do not have them . ami_da_7
A 236.78 Maybe it is easier . ami_da_9
A 237.77 Do you need something , Martin ? ami_da_5
A 237.77 , I can keep this for you . ami_da_7
D 239.3 I have everything . ami_da_4
D 241.19 Okay , so ami_da_1
D 241.19 Are you sure of that ? ami_da_5
A 242.28 so it is it is ami_da_3
A 242.28 Yeah , ami_da_9
A 242.28 you have a copy , Susan . ami_da_4
A 245.17 You too David , I think . ami_da_4
A 248.02 So in fact there are more places than people , so we wo not be that constrained . ami_da_4
A 252.62 as you know some of us and some of you here actually , Martin and David are part time . ami_da_4
A 258.34 So it it is for the moment quite comfortable . ami_da_9
A 261.15 Normally we should even get an extra an extra place for , you know , temporary people coming to work on on projects . ami_da_4
A 269.6 yeah , ami_da_4
A 269.6 I ami_da_4
A 269.6 yeah , ami_da_4
A 269.6 I counted ami_da_4
A 269.6 so we have fifteen pers physical persons and about sixteen , I think , persons ami_da_4
A 269.6 oh , actually , eighteen persons in the offices . ami_da_4
C 281.97 Two Six seven eight nine ten eleven ami_da_16
C 281.97 twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen . ami_da_16
D 284.48 Yeah , ami_da_9
D 284.48 but counting the rea the the reading room . ami_da_4
A 286.98 Exactly , ami_da_9
A 286.98 it so one of the issues here , it is probably not on the slides , is that we would like to have , unlike what had until now , a lounge or reading room in one of the the offices . ami_da_4
A 299.92 So in one of the rooms . ami_da_4
C 301.4 Do we really need that ? ami_da_5
C 301.4 Okay . ami_da_1
A 303.29 , I think quite a lot of people e expressed the need for that . ami_da_4
A 307.26 So if we could do it , then I think it would be much nicer . ami_da_4
A 311.67 let me also st say something ami_da_3
A 311.67 Yep . ami_da_1
D 313.89 And Susan , do not forget the time we spend to for discussions about that room , so you should be able to valorize this if possible . ami_da_4
A 323.43 Yeah , I I think so . ami_da_9
D 324.03 But I still agree with you that the b the we are not so we are not so large , as far as space is concerned . ami_da_4
C 328.41 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 329.12 because fifteen people to put in there eighteen positions , ami_da_4
D 329.12 so to the best if you take two people room for the reading room , then you have sixteen places . ami_da_6
A 342.98 Well , sixteen slots for fifteen people . ami_da_4
A 346.36 So it is still should be feasible . ami_da_9
D 348.63 Yeah , that that also means that the growth will be zero . ami_da_4
A 349.46 That is ami_da_3
A 349.46 Yeah , ami_da_9
A 349.46 I think that is quite important to manage some space . ami_da_4
A 355.26 Maybe we can think of , yeah , some two or three , yeah , for visiting people . ami_da_6
D 357.66 Visiting visiti visiting researchers , students coming for exchange students et cetera . ami_da_6
A 360.66 Correct . ami_da_9
C 362.16 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 363.92 Okay , so let me finish with the the constraints which are almost done . ami_da_7
A 368.2 So we also need to to find the a spot for the photocopier , the fax machine , and the printer . ami_da_4
A 374.07 The fax , you know , is very small , but the photocopier is quite huge , and the printer is well ab this size . ami_da_4
A 381.86 okay , ami_da_2
A 381.86 the offices comes with white boards . ami_da_4
A 385.08 Not very very important . ami_da_9
A 387.14 the furniture that w each each person has and you have a list of people . ami_da_4
A 394.73 So the thing you you ought to know is that we are not the only ones that w we are thin that that are thinking about for well , about putting people i in these rooms . ami_da_4
A 405.71 there is another group that is also having discussions . ami_da_4
A 409.32 So the idea is that today we will just try to f ami_da_4
A 409.32 start seeing the main constraints and then you have time to to go and think about it ami_da_4
A 409.32 ask the people you know , your assistants , for instance , and at the next meeting we will try to to come with one solution . ami_da_6
A 427.99 , the other group will also propose a solution and then there will be another negotiation . ami_da_4
A 433.08 if i if we do not get these ? ami_da_5
A 433.08 , well basically they are promised to us so ami_da_4
A 433.08 Do do you think there are chances that they take from us one of the rooms or ami_da_5
A 433.08 Yeah , ami_da_3
A 433.08 I ami_da_3
A 433.08 I ami_da_3
A 433.08 I think it is , yeah . ami_da_3
C 433.49 And if we do not get this space then what happens ? ami_da_5
C 433.49 These , yeah . ami_da_4
D 441.22 We j we stay where we are . ami_da_4
C 450.08 Okay . ami_da_1
D 453.56 No the the the chances might be that there are more people to put in that space . ami_da_4
A 456.98 Yeah i yeah , ami_da_9
A 456.98 that is one of the the problems . ami_da_4
A 459.32 I think maybe we should take this into account and maybe think of some of the bigger rooms with four people , ami_da_6
A 459.32 one being temporary or or part time . ami_da_4
A 468.3 okay , so maybe we could try to to see now what would be the main options . ami_da_6
A 476.79 Say the general , well , arrangement options . ami_da_4
A 480.73 Do you think that we should put people , say , according to projects for instance ? ami_da_6
A 480.73 In in the table that that we have , we also have the the p the main projects on which the people are working . ami_da_4
A 495.69 So how ami_da_3
A 495.69 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 496.83 Andre , sorry for interrupting , ami_da_14
D 496.83 but one again clarification question , ami_da_7
D 496.83 what is the real margin of manoeuvre that we have for these discussions , ami_da_5
D 496.83 because at least we are half per cent fifty per cent of from EPFL and sometimes you have meetings where w y the the decision is already taken , so you can spend quite a lot of time discussing things , ami_da_4
D 496.83 so what what will be the impact of what we will come out come up with ? ami_da_5
D 496.83 So , another way of a ami_da_3
D 496.83 Another way of asking the question , is there any other group already working on on the how this should be should be allocated ? ami_da_5
D 496.83 Or are we the the one that is supposed to do the p the the p position for it ? ami_da_5
D 496.83 But wha why why do not they have any representative here . ami_da_5
A 522.92 Oh , actually what is fixed is the n the number of rooms . ami_da_4
A 527.04 This we cannot really change . ami_da_4
A 528.61 I mean at least not us , it would be much more difficult to get another another room for instance . ami_da_4
A 534.51 But what is absolutely n not fixed is the arrangement of the people in the rooms . ami_da_4
A 539.91 So basically we are all the permutations are possible at the moment . ami_da_4
A 551.81 Well , what we are looking for is a solution that suits everyone and that makes the maximum of people happy . ami_da_4
A 561.46 So the other group is , I do not think we have to see them as competitors , but they are just trying to to find another local optimum . ami_da_4
A 569.29 Or l ami_da_3
A 569.29 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 571.79 I mean ami_da_3
D 571.79 Yeah , ami_da_9
D 571.79 why do we do it separately ? ami_da_5
D 571.79 Okay . ami_da_1
C 572.6 Yeah , ami_da_9
C 572.6 why did not we have a meeting together ? ami_da_5
C 572.6 Well , certainly we have to ask Pierrette and and Maggie , since they are not here , because they also have a lot of students that they have to see as we do , and so that is another consideration , too . ami_da_4
B 574.57 , they have another group and then Andre and Agnes will discuss about it with . ami_da_4
B 581.15 You are the rep representative of this group actually . ami_da_4
A 583.27 Yeah we ami_da_9
A 583.27 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 584.51 I ami_da_3
A 584.51 I think that is ami_da_3
A 584.51 Yeah , there is no real competition between the two , but we will just try to find at least two solutions and see how how close they are , actually . ami_da_4
A 593.75 It is it is ami_da_4
A 593.75 I think well the m the people who who decided this thought it was the best solution to , well , you know , find two two kinds of opinions . ami_da_4
A 604.54 Yeah . ami_da_4
A 605.21 Well , we could have been eight h sitting around here and and talking , ami_da_4
A 605.21 but I think it is it is more difficult . ami_da_9
D 610.7 No , ami_da_9
D 610.7 but you know that that is a standard thing . ami_da_4
D 612.19 It is ami_da_3
D 612.19 Suppose that somebody for some strange reasons want to be in the corner and we do not know about that , we will put them put her or him somewhere else , then we will do plenty of work for nothing , because we will not have this constraint . ami_da_4
D 626.45 We will not be aware of this constraint . ami_da_4
A 626.6 Well ami_da_3
A 626.6 Exactly , ami_da_9
A 626.6 I think ami_da_3
A 626.6 So so today the goal is not to to find the solution today , but to set some constraints and then go and see the people and find out if they have any preferences . ami_da_4
D 631.54 Oh , okay . ami_da_1
D 633.72 Okay . ami_da_1
A 638.83 Obviously we wo not be able to accommodate all the the preferences , but at least we will find the most the most important ones . ami_da_4
A 646.75 P s ami_da_3
A 646.75 I think ami_da_3
D 651.41 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 653.68 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 656.52 Yeah , ami_da_9
A 656.52 I think so that is one of the things I think we know that they have students , we do not know exactly if they prefer for instance to be alone , or to well , to be with their assistant , or even with another person working on the project . ami_da_4
A 670.48 So that would have been maybe , yeah ami_da_6
A 670.48 , another solution is to ask everyone to provide an arrangement , ami_da_6
A 670.48 but I think that is a bit a bit hard then to to work out . ami_da_9
A 681.89 so since all of you have a copy of the , well , of the drawing , I think for the next time , m maybe you could come with a concrete proposal with names on it . ami_da_6
A 695.02 But let us try to see today whether we prefer to organise people , say , by projects or just professor and assistant . ami_da_4
A 703.65 So what would be f , say , first your preferences , ami_da_5
A 703.65 since ami_da_3
A 703.65 Let is let is start with us , maybe today . ami_da_6
A 709.83 what do you think about it ? ami_da_5
A 709.83 Would you prefer to be alone , would you prefer to be with your assistant . ami_da_5
A 715.6 You who are part time , do you think you can come here on a very w well regular schedule or is it part time , but variable during the week ? ami_da_5
A 715.6 Uh huh . ami_da_1
B 727.03 Yeah , okay , ami_da_7
B 727.03 me personally I would like to to to share the other peopl n the room with assistants as when you have problems of normal life , like the printer does not work , I do not want to ask this to my supervisor , so it is better to to be with a with an assistant to share the room . ami_da_4
A 745.76 And since you are coming on the half time , do you think you will be able to group your presence here , say Monday , Tuesday and Wednesday morning , or is it going to be m much more random ? ami_da_5
A 745.76 Okay . ami_da_9
B 755.46 What I do not think it is a good idea to share t to ha to share the same desk . ami_da_4
B 761.51 I still would like to have my drawers and these things . ami_da_4
A 765.78 Yeah , I think so too . ami_da_9
A 767.12 so Martin , you are also half time ami_da_4
A 767.12 and , well , the third person is Gisella . ami_da_4
A 773.52 I think it is quite clear that each person should have their own desk and ami_da_4
A 773.52 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 778.69 I agree with that . ami_da_9
D 779.36 That is ami_da_3
D 779.36 Whe whe where part time is important is that it is n an overlo load on a room , so for sure if you have a part time person , it reduces the the ranges of time where too many people in the room . ami_da_4
A 779.42 It is no no way we we could put two persons at the same desk . ami_da_4
A 794.28 Yeah , ami_da_9
A 794.28 I think grouping ami_da_3
D 794.63 As far as I am concerned I probably might be able to have a kind of a regular presence here . ami_da_7
D 802.58 , the the thing that f in my case has to be taken into account is that I will have a lot of phone calls . ami_da_4
D 808.77 So I will be talking ami_da_4
D 808.77 o o o over the phone all the time . ami_da_4
C 810.0 Oh great . ami_da_14
D 812.22 So that is not necessary ami_da_3
D 812.22 Well , it depends on ami_da_3
D 812.22 I I have nothing against sharing a a an office with somebody . ami_da_4
D 818.77 I d already did it before , so ami_da_4
D 818.77 and it was perfectly fine . ami_da_9
D 823.4 It just has to be somebody who can work while somebody else is having phone calls in the in the room , which is very d much dependent on people . ami_da_6
D 832.69 Some people are not disturb at all by this . ami_da_4
D 835.72 Some people just ca not work . ami_da_4
A 838.04 Are you disturbed by the phone calls of other people ? ami_da_5
A 838.04 Okay . ami_da_9
D 840.64 I am not . ami_da_4
D 841.71 But and what might happen , but it it will not be so heavy here at ISSCO is visitors . ami_da_4
D 850.74 So that I will have more at EPFL , typically students coming in or asking for things . ami_da_4
D 857.0 As I am not teaching here , I am teaching at EPFL , this should should not be a such a big load . ami_da_4
D 863.16 So for me it it will be essentially I will not be I will not be able to be silent in the room , because I will be communicating also through vocal means , so ami_da_4
C 872.82 before talking more about individual preferences , is there any possibility , what they have done in the faculty of law , for example , that they actually split rooms ? ami_da_6
C 872.82 And so we would take one of the two people rooms and split it . ami_da_6
C 887.82 And you would see that you would have the same size office , but that would give the privacy . ami_da_4
D 888.64 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 891.95 insofar as in just about every other faculty in the building , every professor has their own office . ami_da_4
C 899.53 And it is it is really ami_da_9
C 899.53 it goes a bit far that we have to have this all this sharing . ami_da_9
C 905.44 So one option and that but that we would need to ask about if we could split one of the rooms ami_da_6
C 905.44 That does not really solve it ami_da_9
C 905.44 I mean there is there is really a difference to having to have your own ami_da_4
C 905.44 Yeah , ami_da_9
C 905.44 and sometimes you have you need to have private discussions with somebody or whatever , ami_da_4
C 905.44 so ami_da_4
C 905.44 Well , I I think it is really a matter of personal preference . ami_da_4
D 910.53 Do you go for boxes for instance ? ami_da_6
D 910.53 In the in the bigger rooms where , ami_da_6
D 910.53 yeah ami_da_6
D 910.53 You know like cubicles ? ami_da_6
D 910.53 Yeah ami_da_6
A 914.7 Like cubicles . ami_da_6
D 920.4 You mean , you really want to have walls . ami_da_4
D 923.63 Four walls . ami_da_4
D 924.94 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 926.75 Yeah , sure sure . ami_da_1
A 929.98 Yeah , ami_da_7
A 929.98 I ami_da_7
A 929.98 I ami_da_7
A 929.98 I will try to find out whether we can separate . ami_da_7
A 932.6 I think for the moment the answer at least is no , because it is not only , well , making a wall , but also b making a new door . ami_da_4
A 941.05 So it is quite a lot of of work , ami_da_4
A 941.05 but I will try to find this out for the next time . ami_da_7
A 946.33 , so at least for the moment , as you can see there are I can show them here on the screen . ami_da_7
A 952.24 So there are these two rooms on the left that accommodate one person . ami_da_4
A 957.68 So at least some of the professors , since you are four , could could go well , could take these these rooms . ami_da_6
D 958.15 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 965.64 And quite a lot of rooms with two persons . ami_da_4
A 968.08 how do you feel Susan about the professor sharing the room with her assistants or the one which is the most involved in in the teaching ? ami_da_5
C 979.09 As you know , I prefer to have my own office . ami_da_4
C 982.71 , I also have a lot of phone calls and y you know , have to see people , and with the other work that I am doing with the rectorate , that is really confidential information that I am treating . ami_da_4
D 992.69 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 993.71 So I ami_da_4
C 993.71 That I have to be really careful about too . ami_da_4
D 993.85 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 996.83 But it is a personal preference . ami_da_4
C 998.89 Insofar as what we have had up until now , both Maggie and Pierrette have been happy to share with others . ami_da_4
C 1004.43 So I mean I think that we should still check with them ami_da_6
C 1004.43 Well , not sharing with each other . ami_da_4
D 1006.51 I fully agree with that . ami_da_9
D 1007.4 That is it is much easier to me to to foresee having two people of the same position sharing a room , than ami_da_9
D 1007.4 Oh sharing with their students . ami_da_12
C 1015.56 They each share with an assistant . ami_da_4
A 1016.96 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 1017.03 Oh sorry , ami_da_14
D 1017.03 because but that that is it is it is tricky because of confidentiality reasons , as you said . ami_da_4
C 1017.33 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 1022.7 Yeah , you you you are discussing a budget on the on the project , you over the phone typically you do not necessary want to have somebody who will be dependent on that budget being part of the discussion , so ami_da_4
D 1022.7 No . ami_da_9
C 1031.46 Paid on that ami_da_4
A 1037.56 Yeah , that is that is true . ami_da_9
A 1039.97 , okay . ami_da_2
A 1041.51 , maybe we could s look a bit at the projects . ami_da_6
A 1044.28 Do you think it is a good idea to put together in the same room as much as possible people from the same project , ami_da_11
A 1044.28 since they talk quite a lot of to each other ? ami_da_4
D 1051.01 No , ami_da_9
D 1051.01 because pro project does not last in time . ami_da_4
D 1054.48 They will change . ami_da_4
D 1056.43 That is what ami_da_3
D 1056.43 The only thing that will not or that will change only progressively in time is the status of the people . ami_da_4
A 1056.54 Okay . ami_da_1
A 1063.28 Well , yeah , ami_da_9
A 1063.28 and some of the PHD students will hopefully finish their PHD at some point . ami_da_4
D 1066.12 Yeah , ami_da_9
D 1066.12 they will promote that . ami_da_4
D 1068.85 But still , th some things ami_da_3
D 1068.85 Well , ami_da_3
D 1068.85 yeah . ami_da_3
C 1072.07 Yeah , and also some of our the people mentioned here are working on more than one project too . ami_da_4
D 1076.33 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 1077.27 So For example , Marianne de , she is also working with me on the virtual campus project , ami_da_4
C 1077.27 so she ami_da_3
C 1077.27 that one was not mentioned , but I am not saying that I necessarily want to be with her in the office , but it is just to say people are working on sometimes more than one project ami_da_4
C 1077.27 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 1084.11 Uh huh . ami_da_12
A 1086.77 Okay , yeah . ami_da_12
D 1093.51 If if it if i if projects are what you have in mind , I think that meeting room is the the tool for that . ami_da_6
D 1098.72 If you need to have people in a projects talking together , they just have a meeting room ami_da_4
D 1098.72 if it is not too far away then then it is a very good good practice . ami_da_9
A 1098.93 Yeah . ami_da_9
C 1102.56 Yep . ami_da_1
A 1105.19 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 1105.59 Well , actually , so the lounge could serve as some kind of meeting room , ami_da_9
A 1105.59 but there are also more formal meeting rooms available in in the building , as we now know . ami_da_4
D 1111.12 Yes . ami_da_1
D 1113.82 That is why I was quite receptive to Susan is remark at the beginning is I would not formulate it in a such a an extreme way as , do we really need the lounge ? ami_da_4
D 1113.82 But I would p probably formulate it in the way that , do we want to have only a lounge or s something that can be used only as a reading room ? ami_da_4
D 1113.82 Because because meeting rooms to me are very important tools to do collaborative work . ami_da_4
D 1139.35 But on the other hand we also have to relax , so that is ami_da_4
D 1139.35 Yes . ami_da_9
A 1139.64 So I think we need a ami_da_3
A 1139.64 Yeah , ami_da_9
A 1139.64 and and I think also we need a separate discussion on the furnishing of the lounge , ami_da_6
A 1139.64 which is a whole other topic . ami_da_4
C 1146.5 Well , yeah , ami_da_9
C 1146.5 we will skip that for now . ami_da_6
D 1148.37 Yes . ami_da_1
C 1149.84 No ami_da_3
C 1149.84 I d ami_da_3
C 1149.84 the lounge okay , ami_da_9
C 1149.84 but I think we need to also see it as a overflow place when we have visitors for any length of time , so they actually have a place to work . ami_da_6
D 1155.41 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 1158.03 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 1159.67 Because that is really my one of my worries with the plan that we have here is that it is it pr provides no possible possibilities of expansion . ami_da_4
A 1161.0 Uh huh . ami_da_1
D 1169.25 And this will happen . ami_da_4
A 1169.36 Yeah , yeah , ami_da_9
A 1169.36 for the moment actually I think only one slot would be fully free . ami_da_4
D 1170.0 I mean you ca not you ca not prevent having visitors . ami_da_4
D 1172.71 And you should not . ami_da_4
C 1173.64 No , ami_da_9
C 1173.64 you want to have visitors . ami_da_4
C 1175.23 Yeah . ami_da_4
A 1178.99 that is ami_da_3
A 1178.99 Yeah . ami_da_3
D 1179.04 Which for for fifteen people it is not enough . ami_da_4
A 1181.48 Yeah , ami_da_9
A 1181.48 that means one visitor at a time . ami_da_4
D 1181.5 I mean Yeah it is ami_da_3
D 1181.5 We have we have four professors here and and and two researchers . ami_da_4
C 1182.96 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 1183.51 Or one intern . ami_da_4
A 1184.77 Yeah , that is . ami_da_3
B 1185.77 It is ami_da_3
B 1185.77 It is funny that we move to another building because we run out of space and we will have the same problem . ami_da_9
C 1194.4 Yes , ami_da_9
C 1194.4 but we have more space here than what we currently have , ami_da_4
C 1194.4 so it is at least some ami_da_3
B 1196.4 okay . ami_da_12
A 1197.3 Yeah , ami_da_9
A 1197.3 it is already in progress . ami_da_4
D 1198.82 It is bad it is bad . ami_da_9
A 1199.22 And you are you are working ami_da_3
A 1199.22 I think , yeah , w ami_da_2
A 1199.22 Okay , ami_da_2
A 1199.22 so one of the things I have to do for the next time is fin find out about the separations between rooms and ami_da_7
A 1199.22 Yeah , ami_da_9
A 1199.22 I think it is quite a heavy transformation of the building . ami_da_4
D 1208.92 Because this is really related with security regulation as well . ami_da_4
D 1211.7 I mean you ca not just put walls in in rooms without any specific authoris ami_da_4
D 1211.7 Yeah . ami_da_4
D 1217.09 it is not necessary heavy in terms of work . ami_da_9
D 1219.45 It is heavy in terms of administrative authorisation . ami_da_4
A 1223.1 And okay , ami_da_2
A 1223.1 I will try to find out . ami_da_7
D 1223.48 At least at EPFL . ami_da_4
A 1226.0 And the other question is , can we squeeze maybe four people in the or at least four places in the three three P room ? ami_da_6
A 1226.0 Yeah , ami_da_9
A 1226.0 hopefully visitors do not need as much say filing space , or ami_da_4
A 1226.0 Yeah , they do not have that many papers . ami_da_4
D 1234.2 I think so . ami_da_9
D 1234.71 If you organise the desks in a in a intelligent way . ami_da_4
D 1242.53 Yep . ami_da_1
D 1244.61 Yeah , right , that is the point . ami_da_9
A 1247.77 okay . ami_da_2
A 1248.46 So that is I have to to ask , ami_da_4
A 1248.46 so you do not really feel very strongly attached to this grouping by projects idea ? ami_da_5
D 1256.24 No . ami_da_4
C 1256.92 No . ami_da_4
C 1258.82 No , ami_da_4
C 1258.82 because they can share their ideas across the project , ami_da_6
C 1258.82 yeah , I would say . ami_da_6
A 1258.88 Yeah , exactly . ami_da_9
D 1262.42 Coffee machines are that made for that . ami_da_4
B 1265.29 But usually , whe when new assistants come , they would like to share the room with someone that knows l it is related with the project , ami_da_4
B 1265.29 so he can ami_da_3
D 1274.75 No , ami_da_9
D 1274.75 that is that is proximity does not play a big role there . ami_da_4
D 1278.67 We can discuss with people that ami_da_3
D 1278.67 the the space is very small , ami_da_4
D 1278.67 I mean , altogether it is ami_da_3
D 1278.67 And you do not y ami_da_4
D 1278.67 you do not need to discuss about the projects , you f more need about th to discuss about where is the printer , how do I get furniture , ami_da_4
D 1278.67 I am I do not have a a pencil , where is the the box with the pencils , and so on . ami_da_4
A 1279.04 Yeah , they they can change . ami_da_9
B 1284.77 No , okay . ami_da_1
D 1297.63 This is not project related . ami_da_4
C 1302.13 No , ami_da_9
C 1302.13 and if you look now at their the the current division of the offices , for example , Bruno and Agnes are sharing an office and they are working on totally different projects and and they are they are just fine with that . ami_da_4
D 1311.52 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 1314.44 Yeah , I think that is that is going to be one of the the main things we will have to ask is whether people have strong preferences either in staying with someone or in not staying . ami_da_6
A 1325.16 , are you aware f of any strong constraints right now ? ami_da_5
A 1325.16 Oh . ami_da_1
C 1330.42 Well , there there were , but they sort of disappeared as of October when the no smoking rule came in , because before we were grouping the smokers and now that there is no smoking ami_da_4
C 1330.42 , I guess that is not very important option , though ami_da_4
C 1330.42 Well , except for that maybe you do not even want anybody smoking on your balcony , so ami_da_6
C 1330.42 No . ami_da_4
D 1337.19 Yeah , that is true . ami_da_9
A 1342.52 Okay , ami_da_9
A 1342.52 yeah , that is true . ami_da_9
A 1343.46 So smoking is now no longer a constraint . ami_da_4
A 1352.62 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 1352.77 Is it allowed to smoke inside an office , if it is a one person ami_da_5
B 1352.77 No , not any more . ami_da_4
D 1356.4 No . ami_da_4
C 1356.84 No , ami_da_4
C 1356.84 n it is in in principle ami_da_4
C 1356.84 it is a it is a no smoking building . ami_da_4
D 1357.27 It is non smoking campus . ami_da_4
C 1360.26 You can smoke outside . ami_da_4
C 1361.54 So you can go outside onto the balcony to smoke . ami_da_4
D 1362.87 Not even in the cafeteria ? ami_da_5
D 1362.87 Downstairs ? ami_da_5
D 1362.87 Okay . ami_da_12
C 1364.54 Not even in the cafeteria . ami_da_4
C 1365.72 No . ami_da_4
C 1366.31 Full no smoking building for all of the six thousand students . ami_da_4
A 1366.44 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 1366.67 That is the new regulation . ami_da_4
D 1367.91 Wow . ami_da_9
D 1370.36 On the roof maybe . ami_da_6
A 1372.45 on the balcony , actually . ami_da_4
C 1373.46 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 1373.62 The balcony , okay . ami_da_12
C 1374.07 Yep . ami_da_1
A 1374.22 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 1374.69 Normally . ami_da_4
C 1375.3 There is the there is that terrace . ami_da_4
D 1376.82 But Andre , just a ami_da_3
D 1376.82 Still some places where smokers can survive . ami_da_4
B 1376.88 Wow , ami_da_9
B 1376.88 there there is no place in inside the building ? ami_da_5
B 1376.88 Wow , ami_da_9
B 1376.88 ETPFL is a c it is a non smoking campus , but there are some places tha ami_da_4
B 1376.88 Yeah ami_da_1
B 1376.88 yeah ami_da_1
B 1376.88 yeah . ami_da_1
C 1379.39 No . ami_da_4
D 1387.72 But Andre , just a comment abou about your your previous request . ami_da_7
A 1388.21 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 1390.82 I I do not think that anyone will provide you information such as who does not want to be with whom . ami_da_4
D 1395.67 That is a typical output of ex research in expert systems . ami_da_4
D 1400.97 These are the rules that you never get . ami_da_4
D 1402.47 But you can get them through a proposal . ami_da_4
C 1404.18 The other way . ami_da_4
D 1405.29 So you propose a set up , where people are with other peoples and they will find politically correct ways to tell you that they do not want to have a view on the mountains , but they prefer to have view on the old town , so they would be in the toilets . ami_da_6
A 1417.37 O on the toilets or ami_da_6
D 1419.68 They would p prefer to be in another room . ami_da_6
C 1422.47 No , ami_da_1
C 1422.47 we we do have one constraint that is difficult , which is Gisella , because when she is there she is very noisy . ami_da_4
D 1426.81 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 1427.0 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 1428.17 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 1429.09 She is on the phone a lot ami_da_4
C 1429.09 It is just it is by ami_da_3
C 1429.09 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 1429.41 But that is a sec s ami_da_4
D 1429.41 that is the admin that is the admin so it is part of the work . ami_da_4
C 1432.12 It is by nat by the nature of her work that a lot of it is communication . ami_da_4
D 1433.07 Yeah . ami_da_4
A 1436.51 Yes , Martin said also for him and , yeah , especially for her . ami_da_4
C 1437.45 Yeah . ami_da_4
C 1439.83 Yep . ami_da_1
A 1440.44 Yeah the in she is the interface . ami_da_4
D 1442.71 And that that is a problem , you are right , because because we do not have a one person we d we do not have enough one person rooms for accommodating the the admin place . ami_da_4
A 1442.81 So ami_da_4
A 1448.57 Yep . ami_da_9
D 1452.26 And if you put two person persons or three persons for the admin space , who who who else would you put in there ? ami_da_5
D 1452.26 Because we do not have any assistant manager or we do not have ami_da_4
D 1452.26 We have only one half part half time admin and no other non researcher positions , if I am not mistaken . ami_da_4
D 1470.15 And this is really a piece of a problem . ami_da_9
A 1470.61 Yep . ami_da_1
D 1471.98 Maybe you could put some visitors , but I know . ami_da_6
A 1472.08 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 1475.1 Yeah , I think ami_da_3
A 1475.1 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 1475.53 It is not very realistic in a in a in an admin room , but ami_da_6
D 1475.53 Yeah , because You ca not put a researcher there . ami_da_4
A 1477.86 I think putting Gisella with the other admin of the school is not an option , because we were not offered ami_da_4
A 1477.86 Yeah , it would be nice , ami_da_9
A 1477.86 but ami_da_3
A 1477.86 Okay , I will try to find out , ami_da_7
A 1477.86 but I th ami_da_3
A 1477.86 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 1482.18 I think that is a excellent idea . ami_da_9
C 1485.05 Why do not we ask about that ? ami_da_6
C 1485.05 I mean there is certainly enough space down the hall , wi if all of those offices that are , where half of them are also half time , and they are very under used . ami_da_4
D 1489.67 That is just ami_da_3
D 1489.67 Either you lose one position or you find another admin or assistant manager . ami_da_4
D 1500.2 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 1506.08 So And Pierrette too . ami_da_4
A 1506.6 Okay , we will try , but all these , yeah , are say sort of difficult questions because they involve changing also the offices of the school and , you know , people just do not want to change in general . ami_da_4
D 1513.73 Yep . ami_da_1
A 1517.42 , let is see , maybe we can find some temporary well , at least a proposal for Gisella . ami_da_6
A 1523.2 So , since the one person rooms are quite , well , sort of desired by a lot of people , she should probably ami_da_4
A 1523.2 No , y ami_da_1
A 1523.2 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 1529.75 No that is not sure that is not sure . ami_da_9
D 1531.2 the there are To me there are two options possible ami_da_4
D 1531.2 is either you we can take one of the one person rooms for the admin , ami_da_6
D 1531.2 because some of , typically , the professors have good reasons for sharing . ami_da_4
A 1532.37 Okay . ami_da_1
D 1545.44 Sharing either with a colleague or sharing with some of their one of their PHD students . ami_da_4
D 1551.84 In that case it is it is realistic . ami_da_4
D 1553.34 Then we could very very simply allocate the one pers one of the one person rooms for the admin . ami_da_4
D 1559.21 And that would solve the problem . ami_da_4
D 1561.05 The other thing is to take a two person room for the admin . ami_da_6
D 1563.6 That could be the one close to the close to the here in the centre so the ami_da_6
D 1563.6 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 1569.33 , the the middle one here ? ami_da_5
A 1569.33 Okay . ami_da_1
D 1570.9 But tha No no no , the other one , the the one op ami_da_4
D 1570.9 Yeah , here , this one . ami_da_4
A 1573.43 This one . ami_da_9
A 1574.01 Okay . ami_da_9
D 1574.66 But then that the the question of what do we do with the second position there remains fully open . ami_da_4
D 1581.56 So I would be I would be more of the opinion to to see whether it is it is so evident that , let is say the at least the two full full time professors that are here on the list , we have one here , but Maggie is is not present . ami_da_6
A 1581.71 Well ami_da_3
A 1581.71 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 1594.54 If they really Yeah , and Pierrette . ami_da_6
A 1597.24 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 1597.56 If if if because of personal preferences they would be happy with a two person room , which might or might not be the case . ami_da_6
A 1597.68 Yeah , well . ami_da_1
D 1606.33 I mean it is it is certainly not something that we should impose , ami_da_4
D 1606.33 but we can ask . ami_da_6
A 1607.24 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 1610.76 Yeah , because in this case , yeah , Gisella could take one of the the two person rooms and the other place would be for some kind of visitor , ami_da_6
A 1610.76 that I or ami_da_3
D 1618.0 Yeah , but that is not realistic either . ami_da_9
D 1619.41 I mean , you have you have a fore foreign researcher coming visiting you and you will put put him in the admin office ? ami_da_9
D 1619.41 you will not do that . ami_da_4
A 1625.8 Okay . ami_da_12
D 1628.48 I mean , maybe you can do that with an exchange student , that is ami_da_6
D 1628.48 But you ca not take a senior visitor and him in the in the secretary . ami_da_4
C 1632.13 Yeah , ami_da_9
C 1632.13 with with younger people , ami_da_6
C 1632.13 yeah . ami_da_9
A 1632.21 Yeah , ami_da_9
A 1632.21 or an intern . ami_da_6
C 1636.73 No . ami_da_9
C 1638.32 So we we invite invite and ami_da_14
C 1638.32 then we say , okay you can sit with Gisella . ami_da_14
D 1641.51 you are here . ami_da_14
A 1643.82 Yeah . ami_da_2
A 1644.25 Okay . ami_da_2
A 1645.71 Okay so this sets a bit the stage for for Gisella then . ami_da_4
A 1650.08 yeah we will try to to find out . ami_da_4
A 1652.92 , actually , yeah , maybe we should remind that quite a lot of professors at the at the school actually share their office with their assistant . ami_da_4
A 1660.13 So b it looks like sort of an implicit tradition . ami_da_4
C 1662.95 Except for in every other faculty . ami_da_4
A 1663.43 Maybe not to be followed . ami_da_6
D 1663.7 As Susan said , p ami_da_3
D 1663.7 Yeah ? ami_da_12
D 1663.7 Is that so ? ami_da_5
D 1663.7 Oh . ami_da_1
A 1667.14 Okay . ami_da_1
C 1668.81 Yes , it is so . ami_da_4
C 1670.1 Every other faculty as far as I have seen their offices and the people that I know and that is in in law , socio economics , okay ? ami_da_4
C 1670.1 It is a They all have their own office . ami_da_4
D 1679.68 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 1681.76 Okay . ami_da_1
C 1685.69 I mean in in the in the law faculty they are at best there half time . ami_da_4
D 1686.48 No no , that is it . ami_da_3
D 1689.74 As we said , it is it is really a matter of personal preference , it cannot be something else . ami_da_4
D 1693.23 It cannot be imposed for sure . ami_da_4
A 1693.35 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 1694.66 It is job . ami_da_3
A 1696.39 , okay so I think Well , this sets a bit the stage . ami_da_4
A 1701.98 could we try ami_da_3
A 1701.98 So could you try please to ami_da_3
A 1701.98 Do you want an extra piece of paper ? ami_da_5
A 1701.98 Maybe try to , well , think on your own and then talk a little bit just to the people around you . ami_da_6
D 1713.8 Again , Andre , I think that the only realistic way we can do is to speak for our for ourselves . ami_da_4
D 1720.17 I can tell you according to what I know now where I would like or would be ready to be , but I really do not see how I could decide for Maggie or Pierrette or whoever else on the list , that they should be there . ami_da_4
A 1733.01 Yeah . ami_da_2
A 1734.26 No the point was to try to , well , just talk to them , to David , or ami_da_4
C 1734.58 We are going to have to . ami_da_4
D 1737.33 Yeah , b why why could not we do like could not we do it like for for the the set up of meetings . ami_da_6
D 1741.65 You you ami_da_3
D 1741.65 everyone received that and should provide ami_da_4
D 1741.65 Yeah , I would like to be here . ami_da_4
D 1747.73 And then you will have this multi constraint problem and you work during two hours and you come up with the optimal solution . ami_da_4
A 1752.37 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 1753.36 So w w w ami_da_5
A 1753.36 will you ask people just for their place or also for the other people is place ? ami_da_5
A 1753.36 Because ami_da_3
A 1753.36 Uh huh . ami_da_1
D 1756.39 Yeah , I would I would ask for their place . ami_da_4
D 1758.92 I mean that is that is that is the important thing you want to know . ami_da_4
A 1761.78 Well , but that is ami_da_3
B 1761.78 W what abou what about the the the cafeteria ? ami_da_5
B 1761.78 I mean , we are going to purchase a cafeteria with a projector and all this altogether or ami_da_4
B 1761.78 Reading room , yeah . ami_da_9
D 1767.37 it is a reading room . ami_da_4
B 1769.5 It is altogether . ami_da_4
D 1769.61 Reading room , it is not a cafeteria . ami_da_4
B 1771.81 So in the living room ami_da_3
B 1771.81 Bu I ju just before finishing ami_da_5
B 1771.81 , I mean , we have a cafeteria or we do not eat at all ? ami_da_5
B 1771.81 A place n what we can take a coffee also . ami_da_4
D 1772.31 But that that is an open question whether it is a ami_da_4
D 1772.31 it is a ami_da_4
D 1772.31 it is a it ami_da_4
D 1772.31 At the origin it was supposed to be a f pure reading room for relaxing , reading the newspapers , et cetera , et cetera . ami_da_4
D 1782.43 there has been a very long discussion about that . ami_da_4
D 1784.79 I stinct this discussion is still vivid , that some of the people , I bel belong to these people , would like to have a mixed room where you can have a reading room for sure , but also meeting room if necessary . ami_da_4
D 1795.88 Or , as Susan said , a room an emergency room where you can put some visitors in a decent environment for for for for work , because you do not have any other place to do it . ami_da_4
D 1807.44 But that is that is really an open discussion and that d I think no decision , no final decision has been taken about that . ami_da_4
A 1810.53 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 1812.79 Okay , th then ami_da_2
A 1812.79 Okay then for the next time , try to come up either with your own preferences , ami_da_6

A 1812.79 or if you can poll a little bit the people around you , ami_da_6
