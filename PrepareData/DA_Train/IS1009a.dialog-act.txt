A 132.87 we get ins each of us will get instructions ami_da_4
A 132.87 and we will take it from there . ami_da_6
A 138.04 Project plan , that falls under the same heading pretty much . ami_da_4
A 140.97 , I do not think we have any great discussion at this point . ami_da_4
D 145.55 No . ami_da_9
A 149.44 Here is what this thing should be . ami_da_4
A 151.68 This thing we are going to design is a new remote control . ami_da_4
A 157.54 should be original , trendy , and , of course , user friendly . ami_da_4
A 165.19 So maybe you want to make some notes of that . ami_da_6
D 188.06 Okay . ami_da_4
A 195.04 Okay ? ami_da_5
A 195.04 All right . ami_da_2
A 197.44 Here is what the functional design is supposed to achieve . ami_da_4
A 203.78 That is it is going to be individual work and then at the meeting we will discuss what we have come up with . ami_da_4
A 211.57 The same goes for the conceptual design , there will be individual work whic and then discussion afterwards . ami_da_4
A 219.44 Detailed design , same thing basically . ami_da_4
D 220.46 okay ami_da_1
D 220.46 so ami_da_1
D 220.46 Three different types of design that we are going to be concerned with ami_da_9
D 220.46 okay . ami_da_9
D 236.11 Functional , conception and detailed . ami_da_16
A 243.94 I ca not write with this thing . ami_da_4
D 248.32 Maybe we should redesign it . ami_da_14
A 251.8 Yes . ami_da_14
D 252.79 After we have finished the remote control we will get to that . ami_da_14
A 255.24 Yeah , okay . ami_da_14
A 257.36 All right ? ami_da_2
A 257.36 Then , tool training try out the white board , participant can draw their favourite animal . ami_da_4
A 264.71 Does anybody want to go and see how the white board works ? ami_da_8
A 264.71 So that in case we have to , in the next meeting , present something on the white board . ami_da_4
A 274.68 You want to go Eileen and ami_da_6
A 274.68 Whether you without hanging yourself . ami_da_14
D 276.23 Okay , I will see what I can do . ami_da_7
D 278.52 See if I r ami_da_3
D 278.52 See if I remember how to draw a kitty cat or a rabbit or something . ami_da_7
A 288.1 And remember you have to press so it works . ami_da_4
D 290.06 So that it will record okay . ami_da_9
D 292.19 traditional kitty cat . ami_da_4
A 308.92 Fat , a fat cat . ami_da_9
D 311.19 I have a very fat cat . ami_da_4
D 315.73 And it likes to sit like that . ami_da_4
A 317.63 Okay . ami_da_9
D 318.12 Okay . ami_da_9
A 320.53 And you are Francine , right ? ami_da_5
A 320.53 Would you like s like just to see how it feels , so that you have a little idea ? ami_da_6
A 320.53 In ami_da_3
A 320.53 No , no . ami_da_4
B 322.23 Yes , I am Francina . ami_da_4
B 324.16 Yes , sure . ami_da_7
D 328.77 Am I supposed to wipe off that or ami_da_5
D 328.77 okay . ami_da_9
A 330.83 No , that is okay . ami_da_4
B 331.58 No , Okay . ami_da_9
A 333.57 I do not know , ami_da_4
A 333.57 we will get to that later . ami_da_6
D 336.02 Okay . ami_da_9
B 337.47 What should I draw ? ami_da_8
B 337.47 I am going to draw a snake . ami_da_7
C 347.67 Snake . ami_da_4
B 355.86 How does it look like ? ami_da_11
B 355.86 Yes . ami_da_4
D 357.32 , okay . ami_da_9
A 358.58 Okay . ami_da_9
A 359.98 Okay . ami_da_9
D 359.99 I hope the kitty cat is hungry because I do not like snakes . ami_da_14
A 367.25 Here is the project finance which , of course , we all have to think about when we design this thing . ami_da_4
A 372.72 selling price is supposed to be twenty five Euro . ami_da_4
A 377.25 profit aim for the company is fifty million Euro , the market range unlimited meaning international and the production cost should not exceed hopefully should be less than twelve fifty Euro . ami_da_4
D 386.53 Okay . ami_da_9
D 395.23 okay that should keep everybody on their toes and challenged . ami_da_9
D 400.24 Profit . ami_da_16
D 402.86 is fifty . ami_da_16
A 403.81 So these are all things , of course , to remember with the budget and when you design to materials , cost , etcetera . ami_da_4
A 419.16 Now , the discussion I guess is does anyone of you have experience with remote control ? ami_da_5
A 419.16 I exp I s because we we use them we use them , right , everyday . ami_da_9
D 420.14 Oops . ami_da_16
C 428.69 Yeah , of course , using remote control . ami_da_4
C 431.19 Yeah . ami_da_4
A 433.24 And ami_da_2
A 433.24 now having used a remote control for years does anybody already have like an idea like things you did not like with it , things you would like to change , things you would like to improve with this thing any first ideas ? ami_da_8
A 433.24 Would you like it to be smaller , bigger , have more have more buttons on it or maybe clearly better marked buttons ami_da_8
A 433.24 , you know , things like that ? ami_da_8
A 433.24 Small , right . ami_da_9
B 453.94 Yeah , I ami_da_3
B 453.94 Yes , I I feel that all the remote should be very compact . ami_da_6
C 459.86 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 461.37 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 465.71 Yeah , ami_da_9
B 465.71 those which we get here nowadays it is very long . ami_da_4
B 469.79 And and it should have multi purpose . ami_da_6
B 472.76 Like the remote control which we use for TV , it shou it should be used f for some other purpose also , like controlling the temperature inside the house or for air conditioners , or for heating system . ami_da_6
C 481.7 Audio player . ami_da_6
C 482.73 Oh . ami_da_9
C 483.66 Okay . ami_da_9
A 486.72 So it should be a multi functional gadget that would control all your household machines basically . ami_da_9
B 488.48 Yes , exactly Yes . ami_da_9
B 492.57 Yes . ami_da_9
C 493.31 Divides us ami_da_1
C 493.31 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 494.72 Yeah . ami_da_9
B 495.04 Exactly . ami_da_9
C 495.24 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 497.24 At twelve fifty Euros per ami_da_4
D 497.24 Well who knows if we get a really good designer maybe we can do that . ami_da_9
A 502.77 Well . ami_da_9
C 506.18 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 508.17 We certainly can try to ami_da_6
D 508.17 I agree with her that to market something successfully it should do some more things . ami_da_9
A 513.11 It should be something new it should be s ami_da_9
A 513.11 it ami_da_9
A 513.11 it should do something different than than just what we have . ami_da_9
D 517.36 That is right . ami_da_9
C 517.8 Yeah , of course . ami_da_1
A 518.12 Now , of course , the other thing to think there is maybe the design . ami_da_4
B 518.13 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 521.06 Yeah , design should be , yeah it should be different . ami_da_6
B 523.26 All the almost all the remotes ami_da_3
B 523.26 Yes , exactly . ami_da_9
A 524.22 Like trendy no like f for earlier we saw maybe it should be something trendy you know . ami_da_6
C 527.83 Yeah , ami_da_1
C 527.83 maybe ten ami_da_3
C 527.83 I do yeah , colours ami_da_9
C 527.83 and al shapes also . ami_da_6
A 528.29 Maybe it should different colours or materials or you know . ami_da_6
B 530.68 Are different shapes . ami_da_9
B 532.46 Yes . ami_da_9
C 532.65 Yeah . ami_da_6
A 533.45 so yeah ami_da_6
A 533.45 shapes ami_da_6
A 533.45 right , you know , like kidney shape feels better in your hand or something , you know . ami_da_6
B 537.03 Yes . ami_da_1
C 538.09 Yeah of course ami_da_1
C 538.09 yeah . ami_da_1
D 538.53 Yeah okay , friendly shape , that would help . ami_da_9
A 539.97 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 542.32 I think another thing that would help is if it beeps when you clap , ami_da_6
D 542.32 because I think one of the big things that happens is people lose them . ami_da_4
A 544.12 Yes . ami_da_1
D 550.25 They ca not find it . ami_da_4
A 552.51 That is true , ami_da_9
A 552.51 because they put a newspaper or they put it behind a plant or , we you know , whatever . ami_da_4
C 555.68 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 558.27 And and they suddenly the phone rings ami_da_4
A 558.27 and they want to turn the TV off ami_da_4
A 558.27 and they say , where the hell is my my remote control ami_da_4
A 558.27 yeah ? ami_da_4
A 558.27 Well or yeah ami_da_6
A 558.27 or if it is really , if it is really in a dark spot that it gives out a a sound or a signal . ami_da_6
D 566.02 So some ami_da_3
D 566.02 so , so it is really the beep or , or a light should blink . ami_da_9
C 572.01 Yeah , some beep or something like that , ami_da_9
C 572.01 so that we can go ami_da_3
C 572.01 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 573.12 Or a b Should ha ami_da_3
B 573.12 A fluorescent signal , yeah . ami_da_9
A 573.18 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 574.71 So if lost ami_da_3
A 574.71 If lost signal with b throw signal , you know . ami_da_6
D 580.39 okay . ami_da_1
C 581.48 Yeah , ami_da_9
C 581.48 maybe it should have a light so that we can , we can just recognise where it is . ami_da_6
A 585.68 Exactly , I mean just that is what I am saying . ami_da_9
C 585.88 Yeah , ami_da_9
C 585.88 yeah . ami_da_9
C 587.0 May not be beep . ami_da_9
A 587.9 I am just saying throw signal meaning just whether it is a beep or whether a light or ami_da_4
A 587.9 Okay , my my idea is maybe that the minute it is really hidden , in in other words if it is like in a dark spot , meaning you know like a newspaper is on top , a sweater is on top or ami_da_6
A 587.9 it ami_da_6
A 587.9 it is behind a plant , at that moment it is it is like ami_da_6
A 587.9 , it is like , what you call it a light s sensors , you know ? ami_da_6
A 587.9 In in that moment it has a sensor , i ami_da_6
A 587.9 it ami_da_6
A 587.9 it gets a certain darkness , it ge has a sensor and it gives out a signal whether that be a light signal or a beep , I mean , that we can discuss that later , you know . ami_da_6
C 590.86 Beep or it is a light , maybe it is a light . ami_da_9
D 592.25 And do you think a good c c clue for that is that it would respond to a clap or it would respond to your voice or it would respond what what should you have to do to make it beep or blink ? ami_da_8
D 625.55 Okay so ami_da_9
D 625.55 Okay . ami_da_1
B 627.79 Yes . ami_da_1
C 634.31 Yeah , probably ami_da_9
C 634.31 yeah , probably it is a ami_da_3
C 634.31 yeah , ami_da_9
C 634.31 yeah . ami_da_9
B 638.22 Yeah . ami_da_9
B 638.67 And ami_da_3
B 638.67 Yes . ami_da_1
D 639.09 So the light sensor would activate the signal . ami_da_9
A 641.3 That is right . ami_da_9
A 642.24 You know there would be ami_da_2
A 642.24 right you have to have some kind of sensor ami_da_4
A 642.24 and I ami_da_9
A 642.24 I think voice or clapping it is not specific enough . ami_da_9
A 650.78 I know there are the lamps and stuff , you know , you can clap on and off , ami_da_4
A 650.78 but I think they only work to certain degree and ami_da_9
A 650.78 What with ami_da_3
A 650.78 Oh yeah well , ami_da_9
A 650.78 but then those people we ca not help everybody . ami_da_9
D 658.19 But it could be someplace really obvious and you still would not be able to find it . ami_da_4
C 663.98 Yeah , of course , ami_da_9
C 663.98 that did not ami_da_3
C 663.98 I i ami_da_9
C 663.98 we ca not do it . ami_da_9
D 665.22 Well , because you are s because you are silly . ami_da_9
B 665.4 Then , in that case ami_da_3
B 665.4 Yes . ami_da_1
D 666.89 Because people are silly . ami_da_9
D 668.66 I mean it could be on ami_da_2
D 668.66 well , i if it were like on top of your bookcase and you usually kept it on the coffee table ami_da_4
D 668.66 you know , well ami_da_9
D 668.66 maybe we have to move along , okay . ami_da_6
A 678.08 Okay we have ami_da_3
A 678.08 yeah , we have to move along , but I think we have some good good points to start with here . ami_da_9
C 682.07 Yeah , good point . ami_da_9
A 685.84 Okay , the next meeting will be in thirty minutes . ami_da_4
A 688.49 I think you all ami_da_2
A 688.49 did you get notices on your computer for this ? ami_da_5
A 688.49 Okay ami_da_9
A 688.49 so well , you got the notice ami_da_9
C 691.65 Me ami_da_4
C 691.65 yeah . ami_da_4
A 695.45 The working design , I guess that is the function ami_da_4
A 695.45 ID who is this ? ami_da_5
A 695.45 The industrial designer That is you . ami_da_4
C 702.97 Yeah . ami_da_4
C 704.61 Yeah , it is functional de ami_da_9
C 704.61 yeah , exactly , technical . ami_da_9
A 706.82 Okay . ami_da_2
A 707.46 So , we looking for a working design when we come back . ami_da_4
C 710.26 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 711.71 working design , ami_da_4
C 711.71 yeah , it is it is mainly technical functional design . ami_da_4
A 714.21 Then ami_da_2
A 714.21 And then the technical funct you are the technical function , so so you are the working design . ami_da_4
C 717.25 Yeah , functional design , ami_da_9
C 717.25 and you ami_da_3
C 717.25 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 720.11 So you have a working design and then a functional design . ami_da_4
B 720.41 Okay . ami_da_9
A 724.39 And the marketing manager is coming up with some user requirement specification , like friendliness , and what we just discussed in general . ami_da_4
A 734.3 That would be your idea . ami_da_4
A 735.94 And , of course , price . ami_da_4
A 738.24 That it , that it , that the price is a good price . ami_da_4
A 741.69 I mean , the price is given , but , that was ami_da_4
A 741.69 That is right . ami_da_9
D 745.25 We have to justify that price by having sufficient features to make it sell at that price . ami_da_4
A 749.44 That is right . ami_da_9
A 751.38 And , you know , specifi you you will get specific instructions for that . ami_da_4
A 756.1 I think that is the end of the show . ami_da_4
A 757.84 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 764.72 So we have ami_da_2
A 764.72 well , we have a twen two two two three minutes . ami_da_4
A 770.87 any questions at this point ? ami_da_13
