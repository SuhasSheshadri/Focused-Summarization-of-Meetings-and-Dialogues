B 0.2 Help . ami_da_16
B 8.18 It is up there ? ami_da_16
B 8.18 That screen is black . ami_da_16
B 37.05 Alright , okay . ami_da_16
B 38.83 Okay , that is fine . ami_da_16
D 48.39 Oh God . ami_da_16
B 55.45 Are we done ? ami_da_16
B 55.45 Right , okay , ami_da_2
B 55.45 this is our second meeting and I might be a bit all over the place . ami_da_4
B 74.21 , right our agenda for today , ami_da_7
B 74.21 do you want us to give you a second ? ami_da_5
B 74.21 Okay , ami_da_9
B 74.21 I will go over what we decided last meeting , ami_da_7
B 74.21 we decided upon a universal control , one handset for all , TV , video equipment . ami_da_4
D 80.31 , no that is okay , ami_da_4
D 80.31 sorry . ami_da_14
A 100.7 Sorry . ami_da_14
B 101.81 , that it was important that the product was accessible to a wide range of consumers , wide age range , not limiting anyone . ami_da_4
B 112.16 We decided it was important to reflect the company is image in our product , we put fashion in electronics , you know ami_da_4
B 112.16 that kind of s thing . ami_da_4
B 120.23 , our budget would have to affect ami_da_3
B 120.23 try not to reflect our budget , that we might have a bit of ami_da_4
B 120.23 oh oh you can see it , okay . ami_da_4
B 136.33 dissonance between what our budget was and what we want it to look like . ami_da_4
B 143.4 want it to look uncluttered , undaunting to the customer . ami_da_4
B 148.69 We discussed a flip open design , reducing the size of the control and an electronic panel for further features like programming , things like that . ami_da_4
B 161.19 Okay . ami_da_2
B 163.24 three presentations , I have got written here so ami_da_4
B 163.24 shall we hear from Marketing first ? ami_da_8
B 163.24 No that is fine , that is fine . ami_da_8
D 171.01 is it okay ami_da_7
D 171.01 if I postpone that til later , ami_da_7
D 171.01 I just want to get access to a little bit more information , ami_da_4
D 171.01 is that okay ? ami_da_11
C 176.5 Okay , ami_da_7
C 176.5 yeah ami_da_7
C 176.5 I will go first . ami_da_7
C 177.91 Can I grab the ami_da_5
C 177.91 Thanks . ami_da_14
B 179.07 Unplug me . ami_da_4
C 191.55 What do I have to press ? ami_da_5
C 191.55 Oh , F eight ? ami_da_6
C 191.55 Oh right , yeah . ami_da_9
B 194.0 , FN function F eight . ami_da_4
C 200.97 Okay . ami_da_2
C 203.67 Maybe ami_da_2
C 203.67 Yep there we go . ami_da_9
A 209.34 Yep . ami_da_9
C 212.5 Okay this is the working design , presented by me , the Industrial Designer extraordinaire . ami_da_4
C 219.96 Okay , this is where I went a bit mad with PowerPoint so . ami_da_4
C 225.01 What the first thing question I asked was what are we trying to design ? ami_da_4
C 225.01 Well , a device which basically just sends the signal to the TV to change its state , whether that be the power , or the channel or the volume , everything is just some sort of signal to change the state of the TV or other appliance that it is sending the signal to . ami_da_4
C 249.03 , so I decided I would have a look at what th other people have designed and try and take some inspiration from that . ami_da_4
C 257.38 But although we will want to be taking ideas from other people , we want to make sure that our design stands out and I thought that was something that well it was not really my area because I am dealing with the inside really . ami_da_4
C 274.9 So , yeah I ran out of time so I could not do this one as fun as the last one . ami_da_14
C 280.55 and I found out that most controls use some form of infrared to send signals to the TV presumably because of the cost issue of something like the same thing that computers use , wireless ami_da_4
C 280.55 and , you do not need to send very much information . ami_da_4
C 298.52 , most of them are powered by some form of battery . ami_da_4
C 302.49 Now our one , I am I am not sure whether we want to look at the size issue ami_da_6
C 302.49 because most of them are powered by triple A batteries but those can be quite bulky ami_da_4
C 302.49 so I d I did not know if you wanted to look at something else so we could shrink down the size of the control . ami_da_6
D 319.7 Could I can I interject to ask a question there , is that appropriate ? ami_da_5
D 319.7 You are saying the triple A batteries are small or the surrounding it ? ami_da_5
C 321.73 Yeah sure . ami_da_4
C 325.58 no no , if you if you look at if you look at most remote controls they are quite they are quite chunky and that is because of the size of the batteries , they have to be obviously this certain size to fit those batteries in . ami_da_4
D 335.95 Right , ami_da_1
D 335.95 the triple As are the smallest you can get are they not , right ? ami_da_5
D 335.95 Oh I see . ami_da_12
C 337.69 Yeah ami_da_4
C 337.69 the the ami_da_3
C 337.69 well you can you can get the sort of circular round ones ami_da_4
C 337.69 but I am just wondering about power consumption and how much you need to send the data across . ami_da_4
B 338.28 They are . ami_da_4
A 338.55 Okay . ami_da_1
D 345.51 Okay . ami_da_1
C 347.54 , and d which leads sort of onto the next point about them being small and easy to carry round . ami_da_4
C 354.61 , now the ones at the moment are small ami_da_4
C 354.61 but I was just wondering if we could look at something a bit smaller . ami_da_6
C 361.64 Now the main components I came up with were obviously the power source for the batteries because otherwise it is not going to work , ami_da_4
C 361.64 as I said about the w which batteries we were going to choose , we can discuss that later ami_da_6
C 392.12 and then you obviously need something to decode the information that you are putting in from from the controller ami_da_4
C 392.12 Now these have a wireless range of up to about five metres which is sort of suitable for anyone who is watching the TV unless they are in a cinema , which not most people do so as we are applying to the most audience that should be fine . ami_da_4
C 407.24 And then I was just had a quick look at the external design ami_da_4
C 407.24 but I d I left that mostly to the interface designer . ami_da_4
C 419.18 And so this is what I had as the basic idea of what we want to do . ami_da_4
C 422.76 It is not a proper circuit , ami_da_4
C 422.76 I am not sure if it would work or not , I am not even confident that those are the real the real way you would wire it up ami_da_9
C 422.76 but anyway , ami_da_9
C 422.76 we have just got the the power going to the infrared bulb with the chip and the UI interface which would basically , when you when you pressed anything it would the chip would convert it into some form of IR data which could be decoded by the TV receiver , which obviously means that we are going to have to conform to whatever whatever form of communication that the TVs are already using and since that that is another use and reason to use that infrared because that is what all TVs use at the moment . ami_da_4
C 472.4 And then finally , we want the it to be available to a wide audience at a low cost so all the components that I have put forward are low in cost ami_da_4
C 472.4 so that that should be good . ami_da_9
C 487.72 it should should be different enough from the alternative products to get a good consumer base , we were talking about it before and also just something that I was thinking about , ami_da_4
C 487.72 because they are small they are also easy to lose so if we could look into some way of d dunno some anti going down the side of the sofa thing that you could have , ami_da_6
C 487.72 I th that was just sort of a general point there . ami_da_9
C 517.07 And that is ami_da_4
C 517.07 yeah . ami_da_4
D 517.15 That is a very important part , ami_da_9
D 517.15 it came up in our market research findings too ami_da_4
D 517.15 so I can refer to that , whenever you like me to present . ami_da_4
C 521.71 Alright okay , ami_da_9
C 521.71 and yeah , that is that is what I came up with there , ami_da_4
C 521.71 so if you want to ami_da_6
C 521.71 Ooh . ami_da_1
B 527.67 Okay , thank you very much . ami_da_14
B 530.18 , would you like to continue on from that ? ami_da_8
B 530.18 Or , maybe move the laptop over . ami_da_6
A 531.35 Yep . ami_da_7
A 535.76 Okay . ami_da_1
A 536.24 It can be ami_da_3
A 536.24 okay , that is okay with me . ami_da_9
A 545.16 further . ami_da_3
A 572.8 Oops . ami_da_1
A 591.04 Why is it not working ? ami_da_5
A 591.04 F eight , right ? ami_da_5
A 591.04 Okay . ami_da_9
B 594.77 F function . ami_da_4
C 595.48 Function F eight ami_da_4
C 595.48 yeah . ami_da_4
A 602.56 why is it in the right ? ami_da_5
A 602.56 Yeah , it is connecting . ami_da_9
D 602.63 No . ami_da_1
D 604.86 The plug has not come out at the bottom , has it ? ami_da_6
D 604.86 No . ami_da_6
C 607.45 No , no ami_da_9
C 607.45 yeah it is just . ami_da_3
D 609.04 Meter adjusting . ami_da_16
B 612.74 Oh , there . ami_da_3
A 613.26 okay . ami_da_3
A 614.77 Yeah . ami_da_4
A 616.2 Actually some of my points might overlap with what William is just mention , but basically my method was like whatever brainstorming we did in the last meeting , just a couple of valuable points and started developing on that and there might be some missing loops in this thing which I think we will take a feedback from the marketing because , I have not had some marketing data and basically every product is marketable . ami_da_4
C 618.68 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 642.56 So purpose , as William already said , I would put it to simplify the interaction with TV to make make it as simple as possible . ami_da_4
A 649.19 And to summarise I I would say it is it should be user friendly by being easy to use , rather than having a lot of complex button because you can have an engineering maybe having hundred buttons and maybe having a remote control which has the main features like volume control or channel ch changing the channel or whatever . ami_da_4
A 667.41 But we are to to make it unique so that people want to buy it , will this two features together . ami_da_4
A 674.62 So what the concept is to have a flip top model . ami_da_6
A 677.37 The main functions such as which are like often used will be on the top and the complex functions which say you you can say like the y young generation or trendy generation want to pr say programme their favourite channels or whatever , can be put in the middle part of the f flip top . ami_da_6
A 693.51 So it is like it could be accessed by a wide ra range of audience ami_da_4
A 693.51 and we can punch in new f features such as added features such as shock proof body and maybe a design to appeal to a lot of people . ami_da_6
A 708.26 Findings most people prefer us user friendly rather than complex remote controls because there are times like people have used a remote control for say a year or something and they they are not used maybe thirty to forty percent of the buttons so it is not of no use of punching in the trying to put in those things in on the top of the remote control and try to confuse the user . ami_da_4
A 728.14 As we saw we we have to make a profit also ami_da_4
A 728.14 so we we can maybe go for an economies of a higher production ami_da_6
A 728.14 by fifty million we said ? ami_da_5
A 728.14 Yeah , ami_da_9
A 728.14 with that I think we will be able to achieve economies of scale also , so we can give in add in more features and make it less costly . ami_da_4
C 736.03 Yeah . ami_da_4
A 745.44 , that is so this is ami_da_3
A 745.44 if you ask me personally , I would make flip top with a trendy design ami_da_4
A 745.44 and s maybe we we should look at also like the buttons whe whether they are like soft or little hard ami_da_6
A 745.44 because they are times when the buttons tend to be a bit hard after continuous use usage and all that . ami_da_4
C 762.29 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 767.62 So in overall a simple and user friendly design . ami_da_4
A 773.02 any comments like , if you want ? ami_da_11
A 773.02 Okay . ami_da_9
B 773.23 Okay . ami_da_1
B 775.51 , I think we will chat about it at the end , ami_da_6
B 775.51 okay so if anyone wants to write something down that they want to bring up at the end , ami_da_6
B 775.51 Ooh , it is vibrating , that is strange . ami_da_16
D 782.79 Okay . ami_da_1
C 782.92 Yeah sure . ami_da_9
B 792.6 Oh , God . ami_da_16
B 802.68 Right , okay . ami_da_1
D 803.09 Have I got to keep this here ? ami_da_5
D 803.09 Does it matter ? ami_da_5
D 803.09 I will have t I will have to move it wo not I ? ami_da_6
D 803.09 , whoops . ami_da_14
A 803.45 I think you will have to ami_da_4
A 803.45 You ca not It will have to ami_da_3
A 803.45 this ca not be pulled . ami_da_4
B 809.59 We just do the best we can . ami_da_9
A 813.0 You will have to push it a bit more . ami_da_6
D 815.94 Will it manage ? ami_da_11
D 815.94 Bit more , ami_da_11
D 815.94 oh dear . ami_da_16
A 817.97 Yep . ami_da_9
A 819.28 Yeah this is more than enough . ami_da_9
C 826.6 There we go , ami_da_7
C 826.6 I have got a bit more of the cable . ami_da_4
A 827.03 Okay . ami_da_1
D 828.11 Oh . ami_da_1
C 830.72 There we go . ami_da_16
D 831.36 Is that okay ? ami_da_11
D 831.36 Thank you , ami_da_14
D 831.36 just pull it closer a little bit . ami_da_7
A 834.36 Yeah ami_da_9
A 834.36 I think you can pull it out now . ami_da_6
C 840.09 you should be able to and ami_da_3
C 840.09 yeah , there you go . ami_da_9
B 841.3 Yeah , you might . ami_da_9
D 841.71 Get it right over , ami_da_4
D 841.71 okay , thank you . ami_da_14
B 844.9 Look at that . ami_da_9
D 845.63 Okay , , ami_da_2
D 845.63 I am going to look at the functional requirements from the marketing point of view and obviously our starting point with marketing is always market research . ami_da_4
D 857.25 , so that is where we started , we used our our usability lab , the company is usability lab , we did our usual selection methods to get a cross section of the general public , male and female , all age groups from fifteen upwards ami_da_4
D 857.25 and we observed them in the lab , just their general use of the remote control , you can see we had a hundred subjects there . ami_da_4
D 877.29 Our findings , lots of findings , I have just summarised some of them here . ami_da_4
D 880.97 The overall thing which I have I have got at the top there in italics is that users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls , so it has obvious design implications there . ami_da_4
D 890.76 , we found that seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly . ami_da_4
D 896.95 Eighty percent would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy , ami_da_4
D 896.95 we were quite surprised by that finding , ami_da_9
D 896.95 but that is quite a high proportion of our our , you know , international target group are prepared to spend more money for something that is a bit nicer looking . ami_da_4
D 912.2 , current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user overall . ami_da_4
D 917.9 For example , you can see below there , seventy five percent of users zap a lot , so you have got your person sunk back in the sofa channel hopping . ami_da_4
A 922.62 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 925.88 So again there is power implications there . ami_da_4
D 928.76 , fifty percent of users only use ten percent of the buttons , so again a big design issue there . ami_da_4
D 934.54 and possibly we can also cut back on cost if we do not have so many functions actually on the remote control . ami_da_6
D 942.52 the biggest frustrations that people found with regard to personal preferences were something that you you mentioned earlier , remote controls are often lost in the room , it is a slipping down the back of the sofa type of thing , fifty percent were were particularly frustrated by that . ami_da_4
D 962.72 thirty four percent of people take said they take too much time to learn to use ami_da_4
D 962.72 and I think that ties in with the the previous finding of people only using ten percent of the buttons , they just ca not be bothered to learn about the other functions . ami_da_4
D 976.07 , slightly more than a quarter of people said it was bad for repetitive strain injury . ami_da_4
D 983.56 You know those small movements of the remote control can lead to kind of shoulder and elbow problems . ami_da_4
D 988.96 the vast majority of the thirty five and under age group would like a liquid crystal display and speech recognition , again that was to aid ami_da_4
D 988.96 I think in when they have lost the actual remote control , some kind of speech recognition . ami_da_4
D 1004.31 Something we did not put to them , but which I am thinking of now is even if perhaps the lost control can give off a bleep every now and again til you find it or a flashing light , possibly . ami_da_6
D 1014.96 , that trend reverses in the older age groups . ami_da_4
D 1018.2 So thirty fives and unders who would like those two features , that kind of evens out thirty five to forty five and in the older age group it kind of reverses , they are not so bothered with this . ami_da_4
D 1027.47 I had marvellous tables and things that I could show you , but I think I will just keep it simple , ami_da_4
D 1027.47 if there is any more information I can email you extra details , ami_da_7
D 1027.47 is that okay ? ami_da_11
D 1027.47 so can we not programme a video with this remote control ? ami_da_5
D 1027.47 Just channel hopping . ami_da_4
A 1027.78 Okay . ami_da_1
B 1034.61 Okay . ami_da_9
C 1035.23 Okay . ami_da_9
B 1035.91 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 1036.15 That is fine . ami_da_9
B 1038.69 Right , ami_da_2
B 1038.69 we have new project requirements , we are not going to be using teletext , apparently the consumers consider it outdated with the internet now . ami_da_4
C 1039.01 Huh . ami_da_1
A 1054.19 Okay . ami_da_1
B 1060.35 our control is only going to be for TV , it is not going to be a combined control , which limits you know all of the different things that it limits the cost for us , but it also makes it easier to understand for the consumer . ami_da_4
B 1080.57 It says for TV only , so looks like it is just ami_da_4
B 1080.57 yeah , ami_da_9
B 1080.57 I think maybe Sky things like that might be incorporated into it , but ami_da_6
B 1080.57 I do not know , what do you think ? ami_da_11
B 1080.57 It just said , for TV only . ami_da_4
D 1097.68 Would that imply video use ? ami_da_5
D 1097.68 , yes . ami_da_1
B 1097.81 But I mean , general TV controls do do video as well . ami_da_4
C 1099.29 T ami_da_9
C 1099.29 yeah ami_da_9
C 1099.29 yeah . ami_da_9
C 1103.65 I d well I dunno because the w if you have g ami_da_3
C 1103.65 Yeah . ami_da_9
B 1104.44 I mean you bu well som ami_da_4
B 1104.44 you get com ami_da_4
B 1104.44 you get combined TV and videos ami_da_4
B 1104.44 do not you ? ami_da_4
C 1109.05 If yeah ami_da_9
C 1109.05 and if you got if you got a Sky box , they have one of those plus boxes , you can record straight off the TV anyway so on to on to like the TV hard drive or so . ami_da_4
B 1122.45 I think we assume that it is still got play and stop functions and programming . ami_da_4
D 1125.85 Yes . ami_da_9
C 1127.26 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 1127.46 Anything about that on the market research or something like regarding whether people want a combined something like that ? ami_da_5
A 1127.46 Ten perc ami_da_3
D 1134.29 we did not really look into that but remember we found that finding that most people only use about ten percent of the buttons , I think th th those do tend to be the basic channel hopping things and on and off for the video , fast forwarding , so on ami_da_4
D 1134.29 and I think it is sort of general knowledge that people do find programming their videos a nightmare ami_da_4
C 1146.25 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 1154.29 Okay . ami_da_1
C 1155.83 Ju just as an idea on the speech recognition thing that pr it would probably be quite expensive to incorporate an entire speech recognition thing ami_da_4
C 1155.83 and they are not that great anyway . ami_da_9
A 1162.44 Pens ami_da_3
D 1165.82 In fact I have just called up that table there , we asked those two questions , the table relates to both questions , so we did not differentiate . ami_da_4
C 1167.64 Alright , okay . ami_da_9
D 1172.4 Would you prefer an LCD screen , that is multi function remote and would you pay more for speech recognition in a remote control ? ami_da_4
D 1172.4 So you can see how the the yes no sort of varies across the age group there , and a substantial number of do not knows in the older age group ami_da_4
D 1172.4 , I think that is just general fear of new technology . ami_da_4
C 1176.6 Alright , okay . ami_da_12
C 1182.75 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 1188.44 Yeah , ami_da_1
B 1188.44 bu ami_da_3
B 1188.44 We do have a budget limitation that we ca not control ourselves , ami_da_4
B 1188.44 so I think when we can take a cheaper option which still does the same kind of thing ami_da_6
B 1188.44 because it is something I it needs to be the thing that you use to find it needs to be something that you do not lose , you were saying whistling , ami_da_4
B 1188.44 maybe on the TV you could put like a pack on the TV or something so you ca not see the remote , you go and press the button on top of the TV ami_da_6
B 1188.44 and it beeps ami_da_6
B 1188.44 and you are like ami_da_6
B 1188.44 oh okay ami_da_6
B 1188.44 it is over there , something like that , ami_da_6
B 1188.44 but that is that sounds a lot cheaper to me . ami_da_9
C 1188.63 Yeah but on on that again I just thought because you can get those key chains now and you whistle ami_da_4
C 1188.63 and then it will let off a loud noise to let you know where it is ami_da_4
C 1188.63 so I thought that could be quite a ami_da_6
C 1188.63 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 1196.31 Oh yeah . ami_da_1
D 1199.17 Right . ami_da_1
C 1222.95 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 1232.06 Yes . ami_da_1
C 1232.15 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 1232.39 Okay . ami_da_1
D 1233.66 That is a super idea . ami_da_9
C 1236.79 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 1237.49 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 1238.0 the third thing was that we have to make sure the corporate image is very much incorporated into the handset . ami_da_4
B 1247.66 so we want logo , we want fashionable , trendy , ami_da_4
B 1247.66 I mean what you were talking about with the marketing . ami_da_4
B 1259.31 , people paying more for it to look good . ami_da_4
B 1264.92 , we need to focus on that as well . ami_da_4
D 1267.35 Yes , ami_da_9
D 1267.35 further market research will be needed to kind of focus on what that is , it is going to be different for a fifteen year old th for somebody who is sixty and also across the world if we are aiming at the international market . ami_da_4
B 1273.88 Yeah . ami_da_2
D 1277.82 What is attractive to a trendy New Yorker and what is attractive to a retired South African , I dunno , you get the idea . ami_da_4
D 1285.91 It is it is going to vary around the world . ami_da_4
D 1287.72 At the end of the day , th the engineering design is one thing , it is the user interface design that may and th the sort of you know fashionable aspect of it we might have to change for different markets round the world . ami_da_4
C 1294.12 Yeah . ami_da_9
B 1299.75 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 1300.21 So are we talking of a single model or maybe five , six designs ? ami_da_6
A 1300.21 Sure . ami_da_3
C 1306.3 Well y ami_da_9
C 1306.3 yeah ami_da_9
C 1306.3 you could you could have a number of different designs ami_da_9
C 1306.3 I mean inside they would be essentially exactly the same . ami_da_4
A 1308.81 Alright . ami_da_1
A 1311.92 Right . ami_da_1
C 1313.27 Just ami_da_3
C 1313.27 yeah , ami_da_9
C 1313.27 yeah . ami_da_9
A 1313.49 The features could be same and the body could look slightly different . ami_da_6
D 1313.86 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 1318.07 So ami_da_3
A 1318.07 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 1320.38 What about ami_da_3
B 1320.38 you were talking about the buttons , the controls that are coming out now have kind of big , rubber buttons , not tiny little one , big , rubber buttons , ami_da_4
B 1320.38 but what about , I mean , because we got to make it original , what about you know with the touch screen computers ami_da_6
B 1320.38 yeah ? ami_da_9
B 1320.38 so you it is like a little panel that you touch rather than a button which should not wear out as much either , ami_da_4
B 1320.38 not sure about the ami_da_9
B 1320.38 You do not have to press it , you just have to put your thumb onto it . ami_da_4
C 1335.28 Okay . ami_da_1
C 1340.69 Yeah , ami_da_9
C 1340.69 yeah ami_da_9
C 1340.69 that is what I was just ami_da_9
C 1340.69 yeah . ami_da_9
C 1352.9 No , well no ami_da_9
C 1352.9 because you would not have to you do not actually have to press them you just ami_da_4
C 1352.9 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 1358.4 , think that might appeal I am thinking kind of Japan , I am thinking young , office people , trendy kind of a thing . ami_da_4
C 1369.74 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 1370.01 Yes it will appeal to sections of the market def ami_da_9
B 1372.06 , but quite , , easily labelled so that anyone can ami_da_4
B 1372.06 oh yeah ami_da_4
B 1372.06 that is obvious what that is for ami_da_4
B 1372.06 and it is not daunting to maybe the older generations , Were too big . ami_da_4
C 1384.96 But also er ergonomics as we are saying with the different designs , ergonomics there is sort of physically different things because if you have ever seen the X Box they had to make two different sized controllers because people in Japan would not buy it because the controller was physically to big because they are c ami_da_4
C 1384.96 just generally Japanese people have smaller hands so they could not get round the controller ami_da_4
C 1384.96 which is so if you I do not know what because you ami_da_3
C 1384.96 obviously you can have bigger buttons for some countries or something and smaller ones for others . ami_da_6
A 1424.36 Yeah , maybe to as it it was indicated that risk of repeated use , the injuries , maybe a touch screen could be a better option for that . ami_da_6
C 1433.94 Yeah . ami_da_9
C 1435.31 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 1436.72 So , a bigger b ami_da_3
A 1436.72 okay so y you are dividing designs based on not only segment age groups , you are desi dividing it according to the countries also , the market . ami_da_4
A 1446.33 Maybe for US and all you can have a slightly bigger remote control and maybe in Japan and all you need to have a small , yeah . ami_da_6
C 1449.05 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 1452.56 I think we have to design one product and then the company can take it wherever they want to in the sense that they can make it smaller , or they can make it bigger or they can change the features slightly , . ami_da_4
C 1454.52 Huh . ami_da_1
C 1456.0 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 1461.7 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 1465.28 Th the internal d engineering design has got to remain the same , yes , absolutely . ami_da_4
B 1467.96 It is going to be the same , so we need to focus on just one thing , not get bogged down in lots of different possibilities , . ami_da_4
C 1471.32 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 1477.56 I am concerned , ami_da_4
D 1477.56 when you read the the RSI issue again , repetitive strain injury , I do not think just moving your finger around on a small screen is going to deal with that enough , I think that is still a kind of a question mark issue how we deal with that . ami_da_9
D 1489.82 , RSI tends to be caused by repetitive small movements . ami_da_4
C 1491.38 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 1496.07 I am j I really ca not get my head round this one , ami_da_9
D 1496.07 this may have to be postponed to a future meeting but it is something we should think about . ami_da_6
C 1498.23 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 1501.92 I ami_da_4
C 1501.92 yeah ami_da_4
C 1501.92 I was just thinking about how you could combat that because without without doing something where you have to move your arm around to change the channel ami_da_4
C 1501.92 and it becomes ami_da_3
C 1501.92 yeah . ami_da_9
D 1510.52 I know , and it becomes ridiculous , yes I know . ami_da_9
B 1512.86 Or a speech recognition , ami_da_6
B 1512.86 which is extremely expensive , ami_da_4
B 1512.86 I think that is the only way that you kind of avoid that kind of issue . ami_da_6
C 1514.24 Yeah , speech recognition , ami_da_9
C 1514.24 but ami_da_3
C 1514.24 yeah . ami_da_1
D 1514.44 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 1517.26 Yes . ami_da_1
D 1522.11 Do we have to initially , you know looking at the findings here , focus on a younger age group initially and then broaden out the market later . ami_da_6
D 1534.26 Do we really have to go for everyone right away ? . ami_da_5
A 1537.5 We could focus on the biggest market . ami_da_6
C 1540.22 Ge ami_da_3
C 1540.22 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 1540.4 If say people between age group of twenty to thirty five are the biggest market ? ami_da_6
D 1542.65 And when we have been throwing up our ideas we are automatically talking about business people , young people , trendy people . ami_da_4
B 1547.52 We are ami_da_9
B 1547.52 we are talking about the type of company that we are working for as well . ami_da_4
B 1554.96 That they want it to be fashionable , they want it to be trendy and you would not automatically assume associate that with the older generations . ami_da_4
B 1565.2 Now with the baby boomers , the older generations are actually larger , they have a greater population than us young people , but I do not think we are focusing on that ami_da_4
B 1565.2 , I think we are focusing on a sort of mid range , business kind of class type people . ami_da_4
D 1583.4 I am just thinking of budgetary issues too , for when it does get to the sort of broad scale marketing stage , we want to , you know , not waste money , not be profligate ami_da_4
D 1583.4 and you know focus on where the idea will be taken up ami_da_4
D 1583.4 , first it is most likely to be taken up first of all where the main purchasing power is coming from for a product like this . ami_da_4
B 1604.71 Okay , so the remote control functions . ami_da_4
B 1609.42 we have got the TV , we have got the video , ami_da_4
B 1609.42 now there is I ca not remember what it is called , the little code at the end of programme details , ami_da_5
B 1609.42 yes . ami_da_9
C 1622.4 Video plus . ami_da_4
B 1625.8 We could use that as an alternative to programming in times , things like that , ami_da_6
B 1625.8 is that ami_da_3
B 1625.8 I always found that really easy when I discovered it , because you have got your general record anyway ami_da_4
B 1625.8 so if you there is a programme on you want to put record on , that is fine , but if you do want to tape something in two days time and you are not sure if you are going to , you put the number in and ami_da_4
B 1625.8 it is just a number , it is not a date , it is not a time , it is not a channel , it is not when it finishes , it is not anything like that , it is just a number . ami_da_4
C 1631.98 Yeah yeah . ami_da_9
C 1647.81 Just whack in the number . ami_da_4
C 1656.87 And you w ami_da_3
C 1656.87 yeah . ami_da_1
C 1658.94 And you would not you would not need a whole host of extra buttons for that , you just need one because you have already got all the numbers there anyway , ami_da_4
C 1658.94 yeah . ami_da_1
B 1662.48 No . ami_da_9
B 1664.23 You have already got the numbers for typing in anyway . ami_da_4
D 1665.69 Right , ami_da_1
D 1665.69 I have not come across that function ami_da_4
D 1665.69 but it sounds wonderful . ami_da_9
B 1669.4 It is ami_da_9
B 1669.4 after ami_da_3
B 1669.4 if you look in the newspaper , TV guide or any TV guide there is a five , six digit number afterwards and that is the number you put in and it is recorded that it is going to be on on Tuesdays at ten o'clock on the seventeenth ami_da_4
B 1669.4 so you do not have to worry about dates and you do not have to worry about times , and it has been around for quite a long time . ami_da_4
C 1671.85 It is not ami_da_3
C 1671.85 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 1690.16 Right . ami_da_1
C 1693.47 It is been been around for a long time it is just it is not very well advertised as to how to use it and things . ami_da_4
B 1697.12 No it is not ami_da_9
B 1697.12 but I think if awareness was kind of brought to the forefront about that ami_da_4
D 1698.1 Superb . ami_da_9
D 1702.49 Yes . ami_da_1
C 1703.3 Though if y if you have got something like Sky anyway you can just click on it you can just press the button on the programme once ami_da_4
C 1703.3 and it will record that programme when it is on and you press it on it twice and it will record the whole series . ami_da_4
D 1711.5 Right . ami_da_1
D 1714.61 Excellent , . ami_da_9
C 1716.08 So that ami_da_3
C 1716.08 yeah . ami_da_3
C 1718.63 But just to have that function would be would be really good . ami_da_9
D 1720.74 Right . ami_da_1
B 1722.21 Okay so ami_da_2
D 1723.2 Can I just run this past you while it occurs to me , ami_da_7
D 1723.2 I do not mean to quickly jump from one subject to another , but just discussing the different age groups and targeting the different age groups it occurs to me , to produce our own mobile phones , that that is kind of what led us on to comparing TV remote controls with with their design features , , chain companies like Carphone Warehouse , you can pop in anytime with a phone that you bought for them ami_da_4
D 1723.2 w if you have got any problems with it and they will fix it , they will phone the company , you can use their telephones . ami_da_4
C 1747.48 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 1750.78 Is it worthwhile with with our retail outlets having a a similar kind of service so that if older users were deterred from buying this , if they know they can just pop into one of our high street outlets , th you know , which button is it I press for this ? ami_da_6
D 1750.78 Th as free as a free aspect of our service , would that not make it more attractive to them ? ami_da_6
C 1770.63 But the only problem is that with a mobile phone you signed for a contract so they ami_da_4
C 1770.63 the companies who who you deal with have actually ami_da_4
C 1770.63 they have they have got an obligation to to help you out ami_da_4
C 1770.63 and also I mean it is it is fair enough to have some sort of help service ami_da_9
C 1770.63 but ami_da_9
C 1770.63 I ami_da_9
C 1770.63 I am not sure how much the cost would be of having ami_da_9
C 1770.63 Yeah , ami_da_4
C 1770.63 I mean ami_da_3
C 1770.63 I mean instru instruction books ami_da_4
C 1770.63 I feel c ami_da_4
C 1770.63 I reckon can cover that . ami_da_4
D 1793.81 Right . ami_da_12
B 1794.43 The functionality of it in the sense that you are sitting there , you are pressing this button and your TV is not doing it . ami_da_9
D 1800.71 Alright . ami_da_1
B 1801.25 Taking your TV and your control and saying look this is what I am doing , it is not working , what should I do ? ami_da_9
B 1801.25 I think so . ami_da_4
D 1802.53 Yes ami_da_1
D 1802.53 If it was something as simple as you could not change the channel , ami_da_6
D 1802.53 but I mean for if there were any more ami_da_3
D 1802.53 or are we absolutely definite it is only going to be for TV and video , we are not going to put any ami_da_5
D 1802.53 okay , just a thought . ami_da_4
B 1815.42 Instruction manuals . ami_da_9
D 1819.52 Okay . ami_da_1
B 1819.72 But I mean they are there is customer service , there will be a customer service number thing that you can phone up and speak to and that way there is no call out charge , there is no extra , t the person has to walk to a shop on the high street , . ami_da_4
C 1823.19 Yeah . ami_da_9
C 1825.4 Department , yeah . ami_da_9
D 1828.43 Sure . ami_da_1
A 1833.96 Right . ami_da_1
D 1834.89 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 1835.6 I think it will be too much of an effort for a person to ami_da_9
A 1835.6 for a phone maybe he might walk down the street , but for a remote he will just refer to the manual and all that . ami_da_4
C 1839.56 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 1841.9 Not for such simple functions because we are focusing on that , ami_da_4
D 1841.9 yes okay . ami_da_9
C 1842.29 And they are ami_da_3
C 1842.29 yeah , they should be f ami_da_3
C 1842.29 yeah . ami_da_3
B 1844.69 But we should focus on making the manual as user friendly as possible because a lot of them are just tiny little writing and lots and lots of pages . ami_da_4
A 1847.51 Simple . ami_da_3
C 1848.94 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 1850.92 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 1853.34 Puts people off reading them so they just do the obvious , yes . ami_da_4
C 1854.03 It is the ami_da_3
C 1854.03 yeah . ami_da_1
B 1854.3 It does , ami_da_9
B 1854.3 you just put it in the drawer until something goes wrong and then you try and search through it , so that should be something we think about . ami_da_4
D 1858.4 Sure , okay . ami_da_9
B 1861.23 , what other functions ? ami_da_5
B 1861.23 We need ami_da_3
B 1861.23 I am not sure if we need a design decision now , ami_da_4
B 1861.23 but we should think about c because you have got the dilemma between ami_da_3
B 1861.23 oh batteries , that is what I was thinking about . ami_da_4
B 1877.14 Mobile phone batteries , what kind of battery is that ? ami_da_5
B 1877.14 Well they la they ami_da_4
B 1877.14 they last quite a long time , ami_da_4
B 1877.14 and if you had when you ami_da_3
B 1877.14 th the thing that you get with mobile house phones , you sit it in its charger when you are not using it or t at night or something , but it does not really matter because it never really runs out because it lasts a long time once it is charged . ami_da_4
C 1879.56 they are they are specially made for the for the mobile phones , but they come with a charger , ami_da_4
C 1879.56 I mean you could you could bundle a charger in with it but ami_da_6
C 1897.23 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 1900.46 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 1904.96 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 1906.74 , something like that should reduce the size of it . ami_da_4
C 1909.09 Yeah ami_da_9
C 1909.09 and if ami_da_3
C 1909.09 yeah ami_da_6
C 1909.09 if you if you had if you had one of those just coming back to your other point about pressing the button and setting off the bleeper in the room that could ami_da_6
C 1909.09 Yeah on that as well so . ami_da_4
B 1918.2 Yeah ami_da_9
B 1918.2 it could be on that ami_da_6
B 1918.2 yeah , ami_da_9
B 1918.2 okay . ami_da_9
B 1922.51 S ami_da_3
B 1922.51 Yes . ami_da_4
A 1922.53 So are we talking of a concept of a rechargeable something on the remote ? ami_da_5
C 1925.52 Yeah some sort of docking station or ami_da_4
C 1925.52 yeah . ami_da_1
B 1927.73 Rechargeable with a docking station . ami_da_4
B 1930.74 So the rechargeable which would be your field . ami_da_4
C 1933.38 Yeah yeah th ami_da_9
C 1933.38 yeah ami_da_9
C 1933.38 that that would be fine , ami_da_9
C 1933.38 and also that would mean they would not have to go out buying batteries all the time . ami_da_4
B 1936.13 Okay . ami_da_1
B 1939.52 Yes , ami_da_9
B 1939.52 which it is cheaper in the long run as well . ami_da_4
A 1939.86 Right . ami_da_1
C 1941.38 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 1942.91 , th the shape you got trendy . ami_da_4
B 1947.7 I do not want to big box with lots of things , you do not want a tiny sort of little thing either , because then you have got the repetitive strain injury no matter how many how much you try and make it simple , ami_da_4
B 1947.7 They do . ami_da_9
D 1962.61 And we do not w ami_da_3
D 1962.61 I mean so many remote controls look absolutely identical , these long , brown things with the same coloured buttons all crammed in on the s the surface . ami_da_4
C 1966.24 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 1970.58 We definitely ami_da_3
D 1970.58 an ob an obvious thing , a very simple thing is to get away from these brown rectangles , we do not want that . ami_da_4
B 1977.18 Okay so we have got a flip screen . ami_da_4
A 1977.87 Okay . ami_da_1
B 1980.08 Okay . ami_da_12
A 1982.82 What I was thinking of a design which Nokia h came up with almost six or seven years back . ami_da_4
A 1988.46 Basically we have a flat one ami_da_4
A 1988.46 it ami_da_4
A 1988.46 it looks like a box , like a chocolate . ami_da_4
C 1991.51 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 1992.79 That is very strenuous ami_da_9
A 1992.79 because your thumb is slightly up , so they came up with something like this , curled up , so here , and you do not have to you do not bend your thumb too much , so it is like you can say a banana shape kind of thing , curled up like a boat . ami_da_4
D 2003.79 Slightly curved , curved . ami_da_4
C 2005.14 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 2007.44 G so what happens is you do not have to press your thumb too down like . ami_da_4
A 2012.49 So it is already curled up so your thumb does not ami_da_4
A 2012.49 y yeah ami_da_9
A 2012.49 so we can have a s like you know moulded according to your the way you h hold of it is kind of semi circular in the bottom , something like that . ami_da_4
B 2013.81 Because it is kind of moulded to your hand anyway . ami_da_4
C 2019.84 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 2024.01 Okay . ami_da_1
A 2024.82 I would not say exactly semi circular but yeah smooth . ami_da_4
B 2026.4 Can you look into the company logo ? ami_da_6
B 2026.4 , things that are associated with the company in view to trying to incorporate that into the design of the product . ami_da_4
A 2040.43 Current . ami_da_3
B 2040.79 I mean for example , if it was a C or something like that , you could have it in a vague C shape that opens up kind of like a shell , or something , ami_da_6
B 2040.79 something along those lines to be able to incorporate it quite obviously into the design , while also making it quite different from anything else that is there . ami_da_4
A 2067.28 We could look in at that ami_da_9
A 2067.28 but . ami_da_4
D 2067.8 I mean look at the mobile . ami_da_16
A 2070.96 What we were talking is to make it more rather than like sea shells , ami_da_4
A 2070.96 logo could become as ami_da_3
A 2070.96 you could put a logo in the corner of the model , rather than you know , trying to make it like a sea shell or whatever you were ta telling like . ami_da_6
B 2083.41 Well we need to think about how it is going to look different . ami_da_4
D 2087.03 I think that is that sounds a really attractive idea , ami_da_9
D 2087.03 I have not come across anything like that before , ami_da_4
D 2087.03 if it kind of ami_da_3
D 2087.03 yeah and that opens out into your flip top . ami_da_4
A 2090.25 A sea shell ? ami_da_12
A 2090.25 Yeah we could look in at that . ami_da_7
C 2095.59 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 2095.7 Then it is nice t to h ami_da_3
D 2095.7 you can make it lightweight plastic , ami_da_6
D 2095.7 nice to hold in the palm of the hand ami_da_3
D 2095.7 and just because you are having to actually insert in between the two covers , that is going to take care of some of the repetitive strain injury trying p prevent a lot of that I would think . ami_da_4
D 2108.8 I think it is a really nice idea ami_da_9
D 2108.8 and plus you can get ami_da_3
D 2108.8 you know even though we are using plastic , you can still I mean think of the designs you can get in plastic , ami_da_4
D 2108.8 we can do a nice conch shell or scallop shell exterior . ami_da_6
B 2121.65 Or you could do different , like you get with mobile phones , different fascias . ami_da_6
B 2127.7 You could have different kind of casings . ami_da_6
D 2130.72 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 2131.0 So you could have like psychedelic ones for younger people and sleek ones and ami_da_6
B 2131.0 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 2138.3 Less chance of it being lost too , it is not like a chocolate brown lozenge that is going to go down the sofa ami_da_4
D 2138.3 and people might want to put it on their mantelpiece or whatever as a ki if it looks attractive enough as a kind of ornament ami_da_6
D 2138.3 they do not not going to lose it so much either . ami_da_4
D 2151.62 It is easier to bit nice to handle . ami_da_9
A 2154.55 Yeah maybe we could come at some say five , six des designs and then choose which are whichever appeals the most like , that could be the most common design . ami_da_6
B 2158.76 Okay . ami_da_1
C 2159.39 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 2160.38 Okay . ami_da_1
D 2161.98 Okay . ami_da_1
B 2162.53 Okay . ami_da_1
A 2162.83 But we can like think of five , six designs . ami_da_6
B 2164.98 Right , I think we have to round it up , ami_da_4
B 2164.98 Sure . ami_da_9
D 2167.99 Can I just quickly go over the new project requirements so that I have not missed anything . ami_da_7
D 2171.96 So it is no teletext , it is only for TV and by implication video , our corporate image should be incorporated in the remote control , ami_da_4
D 2171.96 something about Videoplus . ami_da_5
B 2182.36 That was in cutting down the number that was kind of separate that was cutting down the number of functions , making it simpler so instead of having lots of things you put in for date ami_da_4
B 2182.36 It is kind of takes the place of having a button to press for the date and having the button to press for the channel , things like that . ami_da_4
D 2188.74 Right . ami_da_1
D 2190.2 Right . ami_da_1
D 2194.12 Right , so when they press for programming you it comes up on the LCD , a reminder about using Videoplus ? ami_da_6
D 2194.12 So that they have a look at the guide and ami_da_6
D 2194.12 Or was is this nothing to do with the project requirements , is this just that was an add on feature ? ami_da_5
D 2194.12 Uh huh . ami_da_1
D 2211.55 Right . ami_da_1
D 2213.46 Right , so it is kind of doing away with the programming feature ? ami_da_4
D 2213.46 Right . ami_da_12
B 2214.44 it could be it ami_da_3
B 2214.44 c ami_da_3
B 2214.44 It ami_da_3
B 2214.44 yes , ami_da_9
B 2214.44 it could be adv advertisement feature , rather than design feature , you know , drawing attention to that . ami_da_6
C 2216.73 Yeah . ami_da_9
B 2226.71 And it also paid lip service in the instruction manual , ami_da_6
B 2226.71 because it is very simple so putting it down in words should be helpful . ami_da_4
D 2235.19 , and the rechargeable batteries . ami_da_4
B 2237.11 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 2237.39 Was there anything else there that we in the new new project requirements ? ami_da_5
B 2240.02 We have got the buttons but I think we will work through that with the design of it , . ami_da_4
A 2248.82 Yeah . ami_da_3
A 2252.76 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 2257.09 That is not at the moment a requirement , it is something we are looking at , what preference so it may come round to market research at some point to see what people would like . ami_da_4
B 2259.27 Yes . ami_da_9
B 2260.09 Yes . ami_da_9
B 2261.99 And we have talked about there being an alarm or something , a beeping for being lost , . ami_da_4
A 2265.43 For detection , right . ami_da_4
C 2265.45 Yeah . ami_da_9
B 2270.05 Learning how to use it should be as simple as possible . ami_da_4
B 2273.08 But there are not going to be that func that many functions incorporated into it so it should be fine and ami_da_4
B 2273.08 the I the instruction manual ami_da_4
B 2273.08 , I do not know if we deal with that , . ami_da_4
B 2285.95 I think ami_da_3
B 2285.95 Yep , ami_da_1
B 2285.95 and different from what is out there . ami_da_4
A 2290.3 Yep , ami_da_1

A 2290.3 True . ami_da_1
D 2292.21 Okay . ami_da_9
B 2292.66 Yep , I think that is us . ami_da_9
D 2294.55 What would you specifically like marketing to look at before the next meeting ? ami_da_5
D 2294.55 Or shall I just sort of generally look at all the issues involved ? ami_da_5
D 2294.55 Okay . ami_da_1
B 2300.12 I think you might get guidance , ami_da_4
B 2300.12 but I th ami_da_3
B 2300.12 Instruction manuals , because there tends to be a demonised thing , u , they are everyone is got like a big pile of them , but no one really uses them . ami_da_4
D 2318.57 Okay . ami_da_1
D 2322.73 Whoops , questionnaire four . ami_da_16
