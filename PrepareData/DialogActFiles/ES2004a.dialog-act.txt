A 80.5 Hi , good morning . ami_da_14
B 81.9 Hello everybody . ami_da_14
B 83.82 I am Sarah , the Project Manager and this is our first meeting , surprisingly enough . ami_da_4
B 91.96 Okay , this is our agenda , we will do some stuff , get to know each other a bit better to feel more comfortable with each other . ami_da_4
B 101.93 then we will go do tool training , talk about the project plan , discuss our own ideas and everything and we have got twenty five minutes to do that , ami_da_4
B 101.93 as far as I can understand . ami_da_12
B 117.62 Now , we are developing a remote control which you probably already know . ami_da_4
B 121.54 , we want it to be original , something that is people have not thought of , that is not out in the shops , , trendy , appealing to a wide market , but you know , not a hunk of metal , and user friendly , grannies to kids , maybe even pooches should be able to use it . ami_da_4
B 142.83 Okay , , first is the functional design , this is where we all go off and do our individual work , what needs need to be fulfilled by the product , what effects the product has to have and how it is actually going to do that . ami_da_4
B 159.4 , conceptual design , what we are thinking , how it is going to go and then the detailed design , how we are actually going to put it into practice and make it work . ami_da_4
A 168.79 Okay . ami_da_1
B 170.38 Okay , right . ami_da_2
B 172.03 We are going to practice with the pens and draw our favourite animal on the white board , ami_da_4
B 172.03 I will go first , ami_da_7
B 172.03 and sum up the characteristics of that animal . ami_da_4
B 184.1 So ami_da_2
B 184.1 Okay , I will leave space for everyone else . ami_da_7
A 188.28 Oops . ami_da_1

A 324.13 It is your best friend and your you can talk to a dog , it can be your best friend , it does not discriminate between you , based on what you are . ami_da_4
A 331.36 Second it is loyal and third thing it is got intuition . ami_da_4
A 340.96 dogs can som sometimes can make out between a thief and a person so basically these are the three unique features I think belong to a dog . ami_da_4

B 420.11 That is lovely . ami_da_9
C 421.2 Yeah and I will have to think on the spot of things that it is . ami_da_4

D 457.97 Hopefully that will stay on , ami_da_9
D 457.97 two handed version . ami_da_4
B 461.09 Technical help . ami_da_16
C 467.94 Okay . ami_da_1
D 468.51 Okay , ami_da_3
D 468.51 Again this is off the top of my head , I was going to do a big cat too , . ami_da_4
C 476.71 S ami_da_3
C 476.71 Okay , some sort of bird ami_da_6
D 481.26 Oh dear , ami_da_14
D 481.26 it does not look ami_da_9
D 481.26 what like what I want it to be . ami_da_9
D 488.77 It is not a vampire bat honestly . ami_da_4
B 489.88 Okay , yeah . ami_da_1
D 492.9 and somewhere there is a body behind . ami_da_4
D 497.78 That is my dreadful ami_da_3
D 497.78 that is the worst yet , ami_da_9
D 497.78 that is ami_da_3
D 497.78 it is meant to be an eagle you can tell it is a flying animal ami_da_4
D 497.78 could have been a seagull , ami_da_9
D 497.78 I never thought of a seagull . ami_da_4
B 501.19 A seagu ami_da_3
B 501.19 right , not a seagull . ami_da_9
C 501.76 eagle ami_da_9
C 501.76 , right okay . ami_da_9
A 501.78 Eagle , okay . ami_da_9
D 508.09 An eagle , again I am thinking on my feet goodness . ami_da_4
D 511.49 I suppose they are all so independent , ami_da_4
D 511.49 I would put that one down again . ami_da_7
D 516.12 Da dum . ami_da_16
C 519.87 They are good at golf . ami_da_4
D 520.28 Indepen independent , right , ami_da_16
D 520.28 did you say they are good at golf ? ami_da_5
D 520.28 Are they ? ami_da_5
D 520.28 Oh . ami_da_12
C 524.31 Yeah , no yeah , an eagle . ami_da_4
B 525.5 Eagle . ami_da_4
D 526.91 Oh right , okay , ami_da_12
D 526.91 I am not good at golf . ami_da_4
D 529.2 I would say they are quite free spirited , flying around everywhere , doing their own thing . ami_da_4
D 541.43 And , birds of prey are not they , ami_da_4
D 541.43 oh dear , ami_da_16
D 541.43 intrepid . ami_da_4
D 547.15 I will put that , intrepid . ami_da_4
D 553.66 There we go , ami_da_4
D 553.66 hope that pen is going to be okay . ami_da_9
B 554.48 That is lovely . ami_da_9
D 558.67 Whoops . ami_da_16
B 561.11 Okay . ami_da_2
B 563.12 That was fun , ami_da_9
B 563.12 right . ami_da_2
B 565.46 finance wise , we have got a selling price at twenty five Euros , which I do not actually know what that is in Pounds , at all . ami_da_4
B 574.64 Any ideas ? ami_da_5
B 574.64 D fifteen ? ami_da_6
B 574.64 Seventeen . ami_da_4
C 575.11 It is about ami_da_3
C 575.11 , yeah . ami_da_1
D 576.51 Seventeen . ami_da_4
A 576.76 One point four or something like that . ami_da_4
A 578.71 One point four Euro would make a Pound or something like that . ami_da_4
C 580.85 Yeah , ami_da_9
C 580.85 yeah , ami_da_9
C 580.85 something like that , ami_da_9
C 580.85 so that ami_da_3
C 580.85 yeah about seventeen , seventeen Pounds , something like that . ami_da_4
A 582.6 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 584.88 Seventeen Pounds . ami_da_4
B 586.38 Okay , that is expensive . ami_da_9
D 588.37 Should we be making notes of this ? ami_da_5
D 588.37 We can just refer to this later ca not we ? ami_da_5
D 588.37 Yeah , okay . ami_da_1
C 590.86 But ami_da_3
C 590.86 Havi having said that though , if you want to get one of those the the ones on the market at the moment they are s they are about twenty pounds anyway . ami_da_4
B 590.98 I think so , I think so , ami_da_4
B 590.98 I will be able to pull it up , or I could put it in the shared folder or something . ami_da_7
D 593.81 Okay . ami_da_1
C 603.21 So , it would still be ami_da_3
C 603.21 yeah , we had to buy one . ami_da_4
D 603.51 Right . ami_da_1
B 603.88 Really ? ami_da_5
D 605.84 So ami_da_3
D 605.84 so I suppose later it depends if we want to undercut the price , ami_da_6
D 605.84 we d or ami_da_3
D 605.84 or is it going to make our product look a cheapie cheapie option ? ami_da_6
B 608.13 I think ami_da_3
B 608.13 Yeah , ami_da_9
B 608.13 production cost is at twelve fifty , so half of the selling price is taken up by building it . ami_da_4
A 617.54 Okay , pretty huge margin . ami_da_9
C 621.46 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 624.26 , and profit aim is fifty million Euros , ami_da_4
B 624.26 which is ami_da_3
B 624.26 Yi yes , ami_da_4
B 624.26 yeah , ami_da_4
B 624.26 I presume so . ami_da_4
D 630.37 In our first year ? ami_da_5
A 636.39 So then ami_da_3
D 638.1 You have got market range international and you did say earlier it is got to be a accessible and usable by sort of all age groups just t we are not focusing on business market , any particular thing , it is everyone user friendly to everyone . ami_da_4
B 649.13 No ami_da_9
B 649.13 , yeah . ami_da_9
D 651.11 Okay . ami_da_12
D 653.41 Big target group . ami_da_4
B 653.57 So ami_da_3
B 653.57 yes , yes , ami_da_9
B 653.57 I do not think we have to ami_da_3
B 653.57 I do not think it is a case of worrying about different languages and things like that , making that a key point , just that it is going to be in the international market like Australia , America , things like that . ami_da_4
D 661.85 No . ami_da_1
B 669.7 Okay . ami_da_2
B 675.2 What are your experiences with remote controls ? ami_da_5
B 675.2 I mean I have got we got we had three videos , a TV and a sort of amp thing all ami_da_4
B 675.2 set up ami_da_4
B 675.2 so we got one of the universal remote controls , that you programme each of your things into , but that kept losing the signals so we would have to re programme it every now and again . ami_da_4
C 688.13 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 691.12 Alright . ami_da_1
C 691.23 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 691.49 Yeah , ami_da_1
A 691.49 that c ami_da_3
A 691.49 Okay , ami_da_1
A 691.49 you want to integrate everything into one like ami_da_6
A 691.49 Okay . ami_da_1
B 699.39 I think it was quite a cheapie as well , so that might have had something to do with it , ami_da_4
B 699.39 but that was quite good , the fact that you could You did not have six remote controls sitting in front of you . ami_da_9
C 701.1 Yeah ami_da_1
C 705.18 Use all the ones at the same time . ami_da_4
D 708.07 Right . ami_da_1
C 711.24 Yeah , ami_da_9
C 711.24 because you ami_da_3
C 711.24 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 712.92 My experience has only been being given the remote control with the object I buy , not doing any tampering with it and programming , using it to programme TV and videos and things . ami_da_4
D 722.44 But basically on , off , volume up and down , channel one , two , th that basic functions , ami_da_4
D 722.44 I do not think I could go any further with it than that , ami_da_9
D 722.44 so , I suppose it is got to be something usable by someone like me as well . ami_da_6
B 734.98 Yeah , ami_da_9
B 734.98 the main that is the main stuff anyway , I mean ami_da_4
B 734.98 and you do not want to ami_da_3
B 734.98 I hate I hate looking at a control and seeing a million tiny little buttons with tiny little words saying what they all do and just sitting there searching for the teletext button or something like that . ami_da_4
D 750.81 And symbols that you do not necessarily understand , symbols you are meant to understand that you do not . ami_da_4
B 752.59 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 755.18 So simplification of symbols you could think of . ami_da_6
B 757.43 When they are ami_da_3
B 757.43 when you have got the main things on the front of it and a section opens up or something to the other functions where you can do sound or options kind of recording , things like that inside it . ami_da_4
D 768.52 Oh yeah . ami_da_1
B 772.83 Because it does not make when you pick it up it does not make it really complicated to look at , it is obvious what you are doing , . ami_da_4
D 779.78 Actually that just raises a point , ami_da_7
D 779.78 I wonder what our design people think , ami_da_11
D 779.78 but you know on a mobile phone , you can press a key and it gives you a menu , it is got a menu display , ami_da_4
D 779.78 I wonder if incorporating that into the design of a remote control might be useful , so you have got a little LCD display . ami_da_6
A 787.08 Menu , alright . ami_da_9
C 792.17 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 792.89 Right , ami_da_9
A 792.89 I was thinking on the same lines you , ami_da_4
A 792.89 instead of having too many b buttons and make it complicated for the user , may h maybe have an LCD di display or something like that , ami_da_6
A 792.89 like a mobile , yeah and with menus . ami_da_4
D 803.8 With menus , yeah , ami_da_9
D 803.8 yeah . ami_da_9
A 806.03 And if it is s somewhat similar to what you have on mobile phone , people might find it easier to browse and navigate also maybe . ami_da_6
D 811.15 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 812.35 What about the older generation ? ami_da_8
B 812.35 What about granny and grandads ? ami_da_8
B 812.35 , my grandad can answer his mobile phone , but he could not even dream of texting or something like that . ami_da_4
A 816.27 You mean to save it lesser number . ami_da_16
C 819.96 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 823.79 Can he programme his remote control or is it basic with that too ? ami_da_5
D 823.79 Right . ami_da_1
A 826.06 Right . ami_da_1
B 828.12 I do not think they tape things , ami_da_4
B 828.12 I do not think they use ami_da_3
B 828.12 , yeah , the age gap . ami_da_9
C 829.37 Yeah , my grandad is actually better than me at using teletext , so ami_da_4
D 833.26 Right . ami_da_1
D 834.64 So that is a problem regardless of of any design modifications you you come up with , that is going to be a problem anyway with the older generation perhaps , ami_da_4
C 838.64 Yeah . ami_da_9
C 843.73 Yeah , what it just needs to be as long as it is sort of self intuitive and you can can work out what everything is doing , because I mean , menus on sort of new phones now they have sort of got all these pictures and stuff which makes it fairly obvious what you are trying to do . ami_da_4
B 864.3 I do not know , ami_da_9
B 864.3 I d ami_da_3
B 864.3 I do not like the , you know the new phones that have kind of got a Windows based running system . ami_da_4
C 864.43 But I do not know how ami_da_3
C 864.43 Oh yeah . ami_da_1
B 872.95 I find it really confusing , ami_da_9
B 872.95 I kept getting lost in the phone , ami_da_4
B 872.95 I di ami_da_4
B 872.95 I have not got a new one ami_da_4
B 872.95 but my friend got a new one ami_da_4
B 872.95 and I was trying to do things with it ami_da_4
B 872.95 and I just kept getting lost , ami_da_4
B 872.95 but that is just me . ami_da_9
D 878.36 Right . ami_da_1
C 885.18 Yeah , I do not I do not know how for twenty fi , or twelve Euros fifty ami_da_4
C 885.18 how much of a excellent screen you could get , you would you would have to sort of keep it down to a black and white LCD thing anyway , I would assume . ami_da_4
B 893.63 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 898.71 Is it possible that that for the older generation you could have like an extra button that you press for large print like you do in large print books ? ami_da_6
D 898.71 Obviously it displays less on the screen , it displays less on the screen but as long as they can read it that is the main thing . ami_da_4
A 905.32 Okay . ami_da_1
B 905.77 Teletext has got that option as well . ami_da_4
B 911.86 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 913.69 Or what about kind of a dual function ? ami_da_6
B 913.69 In that you have got the basic buttons just for your play , volume , programme things and also and then a menu to go into with obvious pictures , obvious symbols and that is where you control recording and things like that . ami_da_6
D 930.83 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 935.18 The other thing is , just ch chucking into mobile phone f design features again , it could have a flip top remote control so that when you flip over the top , your screen is you can have a bigger screen in the the flip over . ami_da_6
A 946.04 , okay . ami_da_1
B 948.48 I think that is a cost thing , I do not I do not know how much we are going to know about ami_da_4
B 948.48 Yes , no that is important . ami_da_9
A 948.6 S ami_da_3
A 948.6 It might ami_da_3
A 948.6 it might save a b bit of space , it is i instead of looking bulky , it might look small . ami_da_4
C 949.9 Y ami_da_3
C 949.9 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 951.06 Yeah ? ami_da_9
D 956.78 Yeah , like smaller . ami_da_9
A 957.38 But it might have its cost implications . ami_da_4
B 959.48 Okay . ami_da_1
D 959.69 And there is no reason we need to make it look as fashionable and stylish as a mobile phone , it can still be lightweight plastic , you know ? ami_da_4
D 959.69 Something that is easily moulded and produced . ami_da_4
A 966.22 Right . ami_da_1
B 968.84 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 969.16 Sorry I am treading on your territory guys . ami_da_14
C 970.68 No ami_da_9
C 970.68 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 972.92 , right , okay ami_da_2
B 972.92 we have got half an hour before the next meeting , so we are all going to go off and do our individual things . ami_da_4
B 979.35 I think that is probably about it ami_da_4
B 979.35 and then we will come back and liaise again ami_da_4
B 979.35 and I get to do another fantastic PowerPoint presentation . ami_da_4
C 988.8 Just just a quick thing about the about what you are saying about the does does it need to be fashionable ? ami_da_7
C 988.8 The sort of ami_da_3
C 988.8 I I had a quick look at the company website and it is like the the ami_da_4
C 988.8 we put the fashion into electronics , ami_da_4
C 988.8 so I think think the whole design thing might be qui ami_da_9
C 988.8 I mean you do not you ami_da_4
C 988.8 you can still have plastic ami_da_4
C 988.8 and it would look quite good but ami_da_9
C 988.8 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 991.07 Sure . ami_da_9
D 1005.06 right . ami_da_12
A 1005.79 Okay . ami_da_12
B 1005.86 Okay . ami_da_12
D 1006.9 Okay . ami_da_1
D 1009.16 Sure b ami_da_3
D 1009.16 y ami_da_1
D 1009.16 yeah . ami_da_1
D 1013.7 But yeah , I mean it does not have to be that , you know th that was my main point ami_da_4
