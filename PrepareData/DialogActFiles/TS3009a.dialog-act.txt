C 718.63 I feel totally at ease . ami_da_4
B 720.55 It certainly is . ami_da_9
A 723.19 We are one big happy family now . ami_da_14
C 726.13 Yeah something like that . ami_da_9
A 727.4 Well then the serious stuff . ami_da_4
A 731.04 We are we want to sell it at twenty five Euros internationally ami_da_4
A 731.04 so ami_da_4
A 731.04 but we dunno what exactly th ami_da_4
A 731.04 i ami_da_4
A 731.04 it is in dollars , but twenty five Euros . ami_da_4
A 742.29 Our profit aim is , worldwide , fifty million Euros . ami_da_4
C 747.58 So ami_da_3
C 747.58 Alright . ami_da_9
A 747.94 So I did not exactly calculate how much we have to sell . ami_da_4
A 754.92 we want to keep it our costs at twelve and a half Euros ami_da_4
A 754.92 so , keep that in mind when we talk about our materials an f and stuff , and marketing research . ami_da_6
D 765.58 Right . ami_da_9
A 771.46 Now then we all we can sit down and discuss what do we think about our current remote controls , first about design about aim in the market etcetera ? ami_da_4
A 771.46 Well we c we can sit down because presentation can wait . ami_da_4
D 787.17 Right . ami_da_1
A 793.04 We can take notes and ami_da_6
A 793.04 Well who has some remarks about the current remote controls ? ami_da_8
A 793.04 Please ? ami_da_8
A 793.04 No I did . ami_da_4
C 805.01 Well I I did not have to prepare anything about it ami_da_4
C 805.01 is not ami_da_4
C 805.01 , it is it is not my task to talk about experience with current remote controls , ami_da_4
C 805.01 but ami_da_3
A 813.89 Well just w we are four if we if we would just have one then ami_da_3
A 813.89 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 816.5 I think it is im ami_da_6
D 816.5 it is important to look at the remote controls of our competitors . ami_da_6
D 822.89 Get the good points try to merge them into one universal remote control . ami_da_6
A 827.73 Yeah yeah . ami_da_6
D 828.19 On our corporate site I saw a new DVD player we are going to produce . ami_da_4
A 834.84 Yep . ami_da_1
D 835.63 Maybe it is important to make it compatible with the DVD player so you can use your television and your DVD player with the same remote control . ami_da_6
A 836.04 That is alright . ami_da_9
A 839.38 That would be a nice idea , yes . ami_da_9
A 845.57 Yep ami_da_9
A 845.57 yep yep . ami_da_9
D 847.67 Furthermore it is important to make it acceptable for the whole world , for different cultures , maybe , because we want to we want to well fifty million ? ami_da_4
D 847.67 Yeah yeah ami_da_9
D 847.67 so a lot of people have to be able to use it . ami_da_4
A 860.11 Yes fifty million is our aim to a profit , so . ami_da_4
C 865.72 No but the b the buttons have to have to have international recognisable buttons and and numbers and that every culture in , yeah , people in every country can recognise . ami_da_4
D 866.18 So ami_da_3
D 866.18 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 867.17 Easy to learn . ami_da_4
D 873.67 Yeah that is right . ami_da_9
B 874.08 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 874.34 Yes . ami_da_1
B 879.58 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 882.11 I will make notes ami_da_7
A 882.11 and then maybe ami_da_3
A 882.11 well I will put it in the project folder when I am done just now . ami_da_7
C 889.78 Alright . ami_da_9
B 889.96 I also think we should not add too many buttons . ami_da_4
A 890.3 No that is right . ami_da_9
D 890.52 Right . ami_da_1
B 893.22 Modern day remotes have too much buttons I think . ami_da_9
A 896.04 Y y ami_da_4
A 896.04 you do not use the half of them that is that is ami_da_4
A 896.04 culture international . ami_da_16
B 898.82 Precisely . ami_da_9
D 902.13 Maybe we could make one button to switch between DVD player and TV and make the other buttons multi functional or something . ami_da_6
B 905.95 Yeah . ami_da_9
B 908.98 Yeah indeed . ami_da_9
A 909.35 Yes . ami_da_1
C 909.35 Yeah ami_da_9
C 909.35 so it does not become too complicated with too much buttons and ami_da_4
C 909.35 And stereo s audio installations . ami_da_6
D 913.14 Yeah right . ami_da_9
A 913.64 Yep , ami_da_1
A 913.64 and maybe we do we even have more than just a DVD player . ami_da_6
A 919.67 Do not we have other ou ami_da_5
B 921.43 Yeah ami_da_9
B 921.43 we should make it compatible perhaps with everything we use , we we make ? ami_da_6
B 921.43 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 924.41 We also just released a TFT thing I saw . ami_da_4
D 927.99 Yeah ami_da_4
D 927.99 so but th that is kind kind of standard T television ami_da_4
D 927.99 so it also works on that . ami_da_4
A 930.97 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 933.06 Yep . ami_da_1
B 934.17 And I think the people who who will buy our remote already have some experience with remotes . ami_da_4
B 940.42 So we can keep that in mind . ami_da_6
C 941.78 Most people do , yeah . ami_da_9
A 943.37 Well yeah . ami_da_9
C 944.29 It does not it does not have to be ami_da_3
C 944.29 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 945.31 It does not have to be , but we can . ami_da_4
B 946.92 W ami_da_4
B 946.92 well it is ami_da_4
B 946.92 a n it is a new remote ami_da_4
B 946.92 and you do not buy a remote if you do not have anything to to control with it . ami_da_4
A 952.54 Well except if we deliver it together with our DVD . ami_da_6
D 953.58 Yeah ami_da_3
D 953.58 but ami_da_3
D 953.58 We need to to keep it consistent with other d ami_da_4
D 953.58 Yeah ami_da_9
D 953.58 but it is it has to be useable . ami_da_4
B 956.55 Yeah alright , but ami_da_3
B 956.55 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 959.33 Yeah ami_da_9
A 959.33 because we look at competitors ami_da_4
A 959.33 and w if we pick up the good things about that and give it a nice design ami_da_6
A 959.33 Yes . ami_da_1
C 959.64 Well . ami_da_1
C 967.59 It has to be different and familiar at the same time . ami_da_6
D 970.16 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 971.43 Yeah ami_da_1
B 971.43 we could use another form or shape or colour , that kind of things . ami_da_6
A 972.61 Yep . ami_da_1
C 975.19 yeah the shape will will have to be recognised . ami_da_4
C 977.55 I thought about like most remote controls are a long box shaped thing ami_da_4
C 977.55 you can make it triangle shaped , ami_da_6
C 977.55 but that is not very recognisable . ami_da_9
A 985.67 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 988.31 Well we we could make more more oval or something , and and ami_da_6
B 988.31 Yeah ami_da_9
B 988.31 or so ami_da_9
B 988.31 Well yeah ami_da_9
B 988.31 it is new . ami_da_9
A 988.89 Oo ami_da_3
A 988.89 N we can use it as a as a game pad . ami_da_6
D 989.5 No . ami_da_1
C 991.0 Oval ? ami_da_12
C 991.0 I ami_da_3
A 994.53 So one hand has the beer , so the other hand ami_da_6
A 994.53 Well i we already ami_da_3
A 994.53 one of our aims is that it has to be original and trendy ami_da_4
A 994.53 so ami_da_4
A 994.53 Well there has been done a lot of researches about remotes we have to ami_da_4
A 994.53 we can imagine because it is a long time on the market . ami_da_4
D 997.43 Not with two hands . ami_da_9
D 1001.33 Yeah ami_da_9
D 1001.33 yeah ami_da_9
D 1001.33 yeah ami_da_9
D 1001.33 , right . ami_da_9
D 1002.85 No ami_da_3
D 1002.85 Yeah but it is quite important that it fits . ami_da_4
B 1003.14 but young people want something different ami_da_4
B 1003.14 and it is ami_da_3
B 1003.14 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 1011.25 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 1011.52 Oh but it ha it has to be m ami_da_3
C 1011.52 yeah . ami_da_9
C 1014.7 But you still have to know it is a remote and not another ami_da_4
C 1014.7 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 1017.72 Yeah alright . ami_da_1
A 1024.65 So the the form will have been tested out so ami_da_4
A 1024.65 Yes . ami_da_9
C 1028.97 Yeah ami_da_9
C 1028.97 so the long box shaped thing must be , yeah , useful or else they would have been ano another shape . ami_da_4
A 1034.48 Well ami_da_2
A 1034.48 for me personally I have a a lot of remotes at home but those ones that have a a round ending and well just an square middle ami_da_4
A 1034.48 I do not like to use them . ami_da_4
A 1048.38 I have have to it has to fit my hands . ami_da_4
D 1051.34 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 1051.89 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 1051.92 When it falls over it and I just have and then the button that I use most has to be here . ami_da_4
D 1054.44 It should not be boxy . ami_da_4
C 1054.76 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 1055.88 Yeah ami_da_1
C 1055.88 a lo the long box shape ami_da_9
C 1055.88 yeah . ami_da_9
C 1057.87 You have to use one hand . ami_da_4
A 1058.72 It f it fits your hands and then you just push the button that you use most with thumb . ami_da_4
D 1059.4 Nah ami_da_9
D 1059.4 I do not agree with the long box shape it it has to be custom made for the hand . ami_da_4
C 1064.56 Why not ? ami_da_5
C 1064.56 But it does fit in the hand if you hold it like this , and you can make it another shape , ami_da_4
C 1064.56 but then you have ami_da_3
C 1064.56 W ami_da_5
C 1064.56 no w ami_da_5
C 1064.56 what else ? ami_da_5
C 1064.56 I di ami_da_3
C 1064.56 Yeah well but what what what do you suggest then ? ami_da_8
B 1067.7 Yeah it does not fit . ami_da_9
A 1068.56 Tho tho those new DVD players on the market do have those . ami_da_4
D 1068.67 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 1072.13 Yeah but if you shape it If ami_da_3
D 1072.13 No that is ol old fashioned . ami_da_4
B 1073.93 No if y if you look at new Phillips DVD with their remotes pl players they they are the new remotes are not box shaped . ami_da_4
A 1079.09 DVD players . ami_da_4
A 1079.76 Yes . ami_da_4
B 1085.62 Well Yeah . ami_da_2
D 1089.12 I can imagine that us ami_da_3
D 1089.12 Yeah right . ami_da_9
B 1089.6 Yes ami_da_2
B 1089.6 Well most of of them are are somewhat thicker at the end , and get ami_da_4
B 1089.6 yeah ami_da_4
B 1089.6 thinner towards the the other end . ami_da_4
D 1097.16 It fits in your palms . ami_da_4
C 1101.72 Well ami_da_2
C 1101.72 but it is still then the the long box , but then with some round round forms in it to fit your hand , but it is it is still ami_da_4
C 1101.72 Yeah ami_da_12
C 1101.72 yeah ami_da_12
C 1101.72 al alright ami_da_12
C 1101.72 but but it is still it is still sort of box , ami_da_4
C 1101.72 yeah . ami_da_4
B 1106.98 Yeah ami_da_9
B 1106.98 it ami_da_3
B 1106.98 Yeah yea ami_da_9
A 1108.07 Well ami_da_2
A 1108.07 A it h it has it ami_da_4
A 1108.07 it has a ami_da_4
A 1108.07 that is tha th th shape that it fits your hand . ami_da_4
A 1115.45 That is ami_da_3
A 1115.45 We have five minutes left . ami_da_4
C 1118.57 It it has round forms but it in the end it is still the box , so that is what I mean . ami_da_4
D 1120.48 Well ami_da_1
D 1120.48 Yeah but it has it has to fit your hand . ami_da_4
C 1126.23 Yeah ami_da_12
C 1126.23 yeah ami_da_12
C 1126.23 I understand , ami_da_12
C 1126.23 but no no ami_da_4
C 1126.23 I do not mean an entire box like completely square but a also with round edges of course , but in in in at the end ami_da_4
C 1126.23 it is still this long box shape with convenient round shapes to fit . ami_da_4
D 1126.66 It should not be too boxy , you know . ami_da_6
D 1128.16 It is ami_da_3
D 1128.16 No no no . ami_da_9
D 1132.96 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 1136.23 Right ami_da_9
D 1136.23 maybe something like this and then a button here to switch between different systems like DVD player ami_da_6
D 1136.23 and so you can I have ami_da_3
D 1136.23 Yeah right , ami_da_9
D 1136.23 and I do think we have to keep this kind of idea with the with the numbers and ami_da_6
D 1136.23 Right . ami_da_1
C 1145.03 Yeah yes ami_da_9
C 1145.03 I thought about something like that . ami_da_4
C 1149.46 Yeah . ami_da_9
C 1151.45 A big recognisable button on top or something . ami_da_6
B 1156.94 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 1161.73 Yes ami_da_9
A 1161.73 that is yep . ami_da_3
C 1162.67 The buttons should also be not too small , not too big , of course , and n not too close together . ami_da_6
D 1168.08 But it should be possible to to make it ap apparent that there are two functions for every button . ami_da_6
A 1176.08 Yep . ami_da_9
D 1176.1 So there has to be some space between the buttons . ami_da_6
C 1176.32 Uh huh . ami_da_9
C 1179.11 Yeah of course to to to have icons to explain the different functions . ami_da_6
D 1179.74 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 1183.38 Yeah right right , ami_da_9
D 1183.38 and maybe we should use colours . ami_da_6
C 1184.45 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 1186.69 Colours , yeah . ami_da_9
B 1186.88 Yeah maybe we can just like on cell phones ami_da_6
B 1186.88 those well you can you can put on on them , and so you can customise your your own remote with different colours or or special paint jobs ami_da_6
B 1186.88 I dunno but ami_da_9
B 1186.88 Well . ami_da_3
D 1193.64 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 1195.56 Ha . ami_da_16
D 1195.89 That is kind of trendy . ami_da_9
D 1201.43 Yeah right . ami_da_9
A 1203.24 Sound nice . ami_da_9
A 1204.22 Yes . ami_da_9
C 1204.68 I think we have to talk also about the the materials for ami_da_6
A 1209.04 Well it is just about our first ideas now ami_da_4
A 1209.04 so I think individually we will have to come up with ideas for the next meeting about these materials and markets etcetera . ami_da_4
D 1216.01 Right . ami_da_1
D 1217.28 But ami_da_2
D 1217.28 I think it is it is important to notate all the the decisions that we make , ami_da_6
D 1217.28 so we ami_da_3
D 1217.28 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 1218.93 Already thought about something tha ami_da_3
A 1218.96 Yes ? ami_da_16
A 1218.96 Yes . ami_da_9
A 1227.28 Well thirty minutes we have . ami_da_4
A 1229.85 So ami_da_2
A 1229.85 This is about what we are going to do . ami_da_4
A 1236.19 You will get specific instructions when you are back in your room ami_da_4
A 1236.19 so it is logical . ami_da_4
A 1242.06 I think . ami_da_4
D 1243.14 No problem . ami_da_9
A 1243.73 Oh and that is that is all . ami_da_4
A 1246.1 So we will just get a notice that the the meeting is over . ami_da_4
C 1249.8 Yeah now we can still talk about the material , ami_da_6
C 1249.8 we have some some minutes left ami_da_4
C 1249.8 I w wrote down that the case should be plastic of course , hard plastic , the buttons should be rubbery I think . ami_da_6
A 1250.41 Yeah yes say . ami_da_8
D 1257.89 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 1260.72 Yeah it should not be too heavy . ami_da_6
C 1262.4 No n ami_da_9
C 1262.4 n ami_da_9
A 1262.85 Well I have had remotes that they had the function of the buttons was about a layer over the buttons and when I have had use it much it was gone . ami_da_4
B 1274.28 Yeah that is bad , yeah . ami_da_9
D 1274.44 Yeah ami_da_9
D 1274.44 yeah ami_da_9
D 1274.44 yeah . ami_da_9
A 1274.71 So it has to be made in the buttons I think . ami_da_6
A 1277.82 It has to not be loose . ami_da_6
B 1279.05 Yeah that is important . ami_da_9
C 1281.54 Alright . ami_da_2
C 1282.2 And of course there are several electrical cables in it to to connect things to each other . ami_da_4
A 1285.03 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 1286.66 Is there an a universal universal way of transmitting from the remote to the television ami_da_5
A 1286.66 so it is all about ami_da_3
A 1286.66 It is not that in China it is different ? ami_da_5
A 1286.66 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 1294.13 Yeah it is univ ami_da_4
D 1294.13 yeah ami_da_4
D 1294.13 yeah ami_da_4
D 1294.13 yeah . ami_da_4
C 1294.23 I think so . ami_da_4
C 1294.87 It is a a common stan standard way infrared beams an infrared beam I think . ami_da_4
D 1297.65 Yep . ami_da_1
A 1302.1 But y you can have of course different between DVDs and televisions and between ami_da_4
A 1302.1 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 1303.3 And you can use ami_da_3
D 1303.3 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 1305.72 It it is a we we make an a universal remote ami_da_4
C 1305.72 so it ha has to work with all kinds of brands and things . ami_da_4
B 1310.08 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 1312.34 But our TVs are mostly made in China and that sort of country , so ami_da_4
A 1315.79 Probably yes . ami_da_9
A 1317.79 China rules . ami_da_14
C 1321.09 And have well yeah ami_da_2
C 1321.09 I have wrote something down about how it works . ami_da_4
C 1325.46 The user presses a button and with an infrared beam it signals the television set accordingly , but that is pretty obvious , I think . ami_da_4
D 1328.21 But are ami_da_3
D 1328.21 Are we going w with the front fronts idea ? ami_da_11
D 1328.21 I think we should make it universal ami_da_6
D 1328.21 and you can always use a front front on it , you know ? ami_da_4
D 1328.21 You can use it just plain but you can To make it more trendy . ami_da_6
A 1336.8 Well I think w we can look into that in the in the next thirty minutes . ami_da_6
A 1340.44 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 1346.34 Yes . ami_da_1
A 1348.05 Well j just y you get a n a normal front with it , but you can change them when you buy the ami_da_6
A 1348.05 And we should dispatch those kind of fronts fronts a a around the world so ami_da_6
A 1348.05 Well th those fifty million do not do not se sells itself so we have to make some extra effort like fronts . ami_da_4
B 1351.3 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 1352.79 Right . ami_da_1
B 1353.3 Yes . ami_da_1
D 1354.12 Right . ami_da_1
