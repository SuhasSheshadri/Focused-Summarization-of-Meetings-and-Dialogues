A 54.47 Hi Kate . ami_da_14
B 57.2 Just just carry on . ami_da_6
A 57.44 Okay , carry on . ami_da_9
A 60.03 Alright ami_da_2
A 60.03 this is the beginning of the third meeting , the conceptual design meeting . ami_da_4
A 67.04 our agenda should be that we are opening the meeting , ami_da_4
A 67.04 I have ami_da_3
A 67.04 the minutes from the previous meeting are on the shared f drive at this point . ami_da_4
A 77.8 and we should each have a presentation to make . ami_da_4
A 81.87 we have certain decisions to make and we have forty minutes total . ami_da_4
A 86.75 It is twenty five after two at the moment , so forty minutes is five after three , ami_da_4
A 86.75 which I will be keeping an eye on the clock for us . ami_da_7
A 99.77 Okay . ami_da_2
A 102.16 there are the decisions we have to turn to , ami_da_4
A 102.16 but we will come back to them in a minute ami_da_6
A 102.16 after I take us to the minutes of the previous meeting . ami_da_7
A 120.76 Right ami_da_2
A 120.76 as we remember , I opened the meeting , the four of us were present , the meeting the first meeting is minutes were reviewed and approved . ami_da_4
A 131.61 Sarah , you presented a marketing research report which pretty much rep represented that fifteen to thirty five year olds it has to be hand held , power , channel , volume , number keys , possibly a speech recognition . ami_da_4
A 150.39 And then Steph did a second presentation that those functions plus streamlining them with big user friendly keys that were easy to use . ami_da_4
A 163.81 I think all of us agreed with those things . ami_da_4
A 167.04 Kate presented a working design of going after going over the basics on the whiteboard that it should be a simple mass produced device , because of the twelve and a half Pence cost . ami_da_4
A 179.33 but we did talk about possibly using rechargeable batteries and having a docking place as a selling point . ami_da_4
A 187.15 and the new requirements that it for be for TV only and that it include the l so slogan and colour of the corporate design be included . ami_da_4
A 200.98 the corporate image . ami_da_4
A 205.66 So ami_da_2
A 205.66 we agreed that the target market would be fifteen to thirty five with more money than sense , that were decision makers . ami_da_4
A 213.86 Alternatively it would be a manufacturer to enclose it with the TV , but it still should meet those parameters . ami_da_4
A 220.53 and that the function we agreed was volume , power , numbers , enter , channels , a way to move between channels , easy to use and hand held . ami_da_4
A 234.55 at that point we agreed that Sarah would look at the current cost of competition , what what do the current ones sell for . ami_da_4
A 242.7 and Steph was going to look at ec ergonomics . ami_da_4
A 246.43 Kate was going to look at cost and feasibility of the various possibilities that we discussed . ami_da_4
A 251.74 And I was to type up these minutes and work on the final report . ami_da_4
A 256.37 Is this a fair presentation of what our last meeting was ? ami_da_11
A 256.37 Okay . ami_da_12
C 259.24 Yeah . ami_da_9
C 262.26 Yes . ami_da_9
A 265.73 Right . ami_da_2
A 267.44 So ami_da_2
A 267.44 we are ready to close that and go back to our That one . ami_da_7
A 276.24 Right . ami_da_9
A 277.57 We are up to the point of the ami_da_3
A 277.57 Go back . ami_da_7
A 284.55 the three presentations . ami_da_6
A 288.1 So we are going to pull the plug on me ami_da_7
A 288.1 and turn to Sarah . ami_da_6
A 292.53 Is that okay ? ami_da_11
A 292.53 Is that alright with everybody else ? ami_da_11
A 292.53 Especially since Kate asked to be last . ami_da_4
C 295.59 Yep . ami_da_9
A 300.65 Sarah , I am sorry if I misspelled your name , ami_da_14
A 300.65 I did not know whether it was SARA or SARH . ami_da_5
D 306.02 I respond to either . ami_da_4
D 307.43 No worries . ami_da_14
A 307.56 You respond to whatever you get , huh ? ami_da_12
A 307.56 Okay . ami_da_12
A 326.17 , did you do your Hit ami_da_5
A 326.17 there it is . ami_da_4
C 328.18 Yeah , ami_da_4
C 328.18 Right . ami_da_1
A 333.96 Ta da . ami_da_16
D 333.99 Okay , ami_da_2
D 333.99 first thing I want to address is one of the points that Florence brought up , ami_da_7
D 333.99 which was current cost of the competition devices , similar to the ones that Stephanie showed us and and they are twenty to sixty Euros , depending on branding . ami_da_4
D 353.79 Some of them that have a higher brand recognition are on the more expensive end . ami_da_4
D 357.73 But I think that with the current price that we are searching for , we are well within , even on the lower end , of the of the market . ami_da_4
A 367.78 okay . ami_da_1
D 368.66 But I am going to move on to more interesting more vibrant things . ami_da_7
D 376.67 So , ami_da_2
D 376.67 I investigated the remote control market in greater detail , and my the theme of what I was to work on was trend watch . ami_da_4
D 386.61 And ami_da_3
D 386.61 I know that you all are a distance from cutting edge marketing research , ami_da_14
D 386.61 so you know , ami_da_2
D 386.61 I am just going to try to cloak it in really professional terms here . ami_da_7
A 387.83 Okay . ami_da_1
B 391.43 Sorry . ami_da_14
B 395.25 I am glad to see the marketing budget is being so well spent on . ami_da_14
D 410.95 What is hot , ami_da_5
D 410.95 fruit and veg . ami_da_4
D 413.52 Spongy . ami_da_4
D 415.25 And this is all over the catwalks , Paris , Milan , and I am talking about clothing , furniture , shoes . ami_da_4
D 424.16 This is really interesting change from past years , ami_da_9
D 424.16 because it is much more organic , some would say approachable . ami_da_4
D 433.36 And I think if we are to refashion our view of what we want in a remote control , we should perhaps think about incorporating technologically interesting fabrics and some of the bold colours into a simple handset . ami_da_6
D 454.0 So . ami_da_2
D 455.83 I also did a little research ami_da_4
D 455.83 on what again are the most important priorities in decision making about purchasing . ami_da_5
D 467.24 Fancy . ami_da_4
D 468.51 Functional is out . ami_da_4
D 470.43 And f the fancy , and that is exactly the term , I am I am thinking polished , elegant , you know , kind of innovative , but a cut above . ami_da_4
D 481.19 This is twice as important as the next finding , which is technologically innovative . ami_da_4
D 486.05 This is interesting , ami_da_9
D 486.05 because I think in the last meeting we were talking about technology as being so important , but maybe what is innovative is having it simple with with technologically superior fabrics ami_da_4
D 486.05 or , you know , designed in interesting substances . ami_da_4
D 507.52 Ease of use . ami_da_4
D 508.54 Again , pretty low , I mean it is the top three , but each of the fancy and technologically innovative are far more important . ami_da_4
D 516.77 So ami_da_2
D 516.77 I think we should cloak the streamlined remote control device in a series of fruit fruit themed sleeves . ami_da_6
B 532.16 I think that is a good idea . ami_da_9
B 533.8 Do not you ? ami_da_11
B 533.8 Yeah , ami_da_2
B 533.8 I I think we are going to have some trouble when we get down to the component design on this . ami_da_9
D 533.83 Y ami_da_2
D 533.83 yeah , ami_da_2
D 533.83 you know ami_da_2
D 533.83 Exactly . ami_da_9
C 534.98 Yes . ami_da_9
A 535.44 It sounds like the the covers that they use for the remote , you know , your t your cell phone . ami_da_4
D 542.32 Exactly . ami_da_9
D 543.46 I was thinking though that instead of having something like patterned , you know , so , you know , something similar to a summer dress . ami_da_6
D 552.78 you know , it would have like fruit and veg , ami_da_6
D 552.78 is that we actually make these spongy . ami_da_6
D 557.51 They could be ini ami_da_3
D 557.51 initially I thought we could start with kind of fruit that would suit kind of a long hand held , so banana , pineapple and pear . ami_da_6
D 572.42 it could actually the sleeve could take up a lot of the development and the remote control , we would just need to get reductionist on it . ami_da_6
D 581.83 They could be interchangeable , they are spongy , ami_da_6
D 581.83 that goes back to ergonomic , and the youngsters love them , fun for the whole family , everyone can have their own . ami_da_4
D 591.39 So what we are talking about is changing . ami_da_6
D 595.6 this concept . ami_da_6
D 597.0 Everyone has a TV remote , ami_da_4
D 597.0 but then we add in the fact that they could each have their own individual fruit . ami_da_6
D 606.38 That is what is hot on the catwalks . ami_da_4
D 608.33 So , ami_da_2
D 608.33 this is my ami_da_3
D 608.33 This is what I am thinking . ami_da_4
A 618.01 Uh huh . ami_da_2
A 620.61 In most families , do not is not the remote is a remote . ami_da_5
D 625.48 Y ami_da_4
D 625.48 yeah , ami_da_4
D 625.48 but I think I think what this would allow is perhaps a person in the family who had the most opinion about it ami_da_3
D 625.48 we all need a remote , but the person who is really perhaps active in personalising , I am thinking the teenager , the someone fifteen to thirty five would go out and get this additional thing the same way as you mentioned that people would get the cell phone covers . ami_da_4
C 647.17 So when your dad is sitting there , overriding your decision , going no we are going to watch this , you can bring out your own remote and be like zap , no we are going to watch this . ami_da_4
D 656.69 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 657.21 W and plus I think ami_da_3
D 657.21 yeah . ami_da_1
A 659.18 Well ami_da_2
A 659.18 actually some households do have three and four TVs and they would have a remote for each one , ami_da_4
A 659.18 so . ami_da_3
D 663.24 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 666.23 Yeah . ami_da_2
D 666.55 So ami_da_2
D 666.55 this is an idea ami_da_4
D 666.55 and I ami_da_3
D 666.55 I ami_da_3
D 666.55 you know , ami_da_2
D 666.55 this is exactly what the research has has shown . ami_da_4
D 673.63 So I really open this up to any other feedback . ami_da_11
D 677.29 This spongy fruit and veg . ami_da_11
D 682.31 Thanks . ami_da_14
D 686.8 Alright . ami_da_12
C 687.35 Yep . ami_da_9
B 687.59 Spongy is going to be difficult , I am afraid . ami_da_9
C 691.1 And as for as for well budgeting as well , if we are going to have lots of different interchangeable components . ami_da_9
D 701.96 I I just have my ear to the market , guys . ami_da_4
C 704.13 Is this to the market ? ami_da_15
C 704.13 I was thinking titanium , ami_da_9
C 704.13 I was thinking it is just ami_da_3
C 704.13 I have been influenced by pictures of iPods , and they are also minimalist and shiny . ami_da_4
B 705.52 Yeah , I mean basically ami_da_2
B 705.52 we can make these things out of wood , titanium , plastic or rubber . ami_da_4
B 711.0 I suppose rubber is the closest to spongy , ami_da_4
B 711.0 yeah . ami_da_9
D 712.29 Is spongiest , yeah . ami_da_9
D 714.86 That would add ami_da_3
B 715.5 I was thinking titanium myself . ami_da_6
D 726.16 They are ami_da_9
D 726.16 and they they would fulfil the first priority , which is fancy . ami_da_4
D 733.79 I think many of us would associate those with fancy . ami_da_4
D 737.01 Something else we could do is call it something that is fruit and veg oriented . ami_da_6
D 745.02 We could call it The name . ami_da_6
A 747.52 Are we talking about the device itself or the c or a cover for the device that would be an interchangeable cov cover as a separate product ? ami_da_5
A 747.52 Perhaps perhaps that desi that particular suggestion needs to go back to management and perhaps go to another group to actually design as a separate product . ami_da_6
D 758.36 Well ami_da_2
D 758.36 it would be a a very simple product that would have a spongy sleeve that would be interchangeable . ami_da_6
D 763.95 So ami_da_6
D 763.95 That , you know , that might be ami_da_3
D 763.95 And then we could keep it titanium . ami_da_6
C 764.08 Yeah , ami_da_2
C 764.08 but it is kind of pointless , ami_da_9
C 764.08 is not it ? ami_da_11
C 764.08 Yeah . ami_da_9
C 775.03 Let is delegate . ami_da_6
A 777.09 Wo would that be agreeable ? ami_da_11
A 777.09 Do you want to be next or you want Kate to go next ? ami_da_8
A 777.09 Okay , ami_da_9
A 777.09 we will move the ami_da_7
B 778.78 Yeah . ami_da_2
B 779.5 W w would it be helpful if I described the components a bit , ami_da_11
B 779.5 because I think it would give you maybe bring this discussion back to Earth of what we can actually physically do . ami_da_4
C 792.56 Yeah , maybe . ami_da_9
C 793.82 Or ami_da_3
C 793.82 I think possibly it might be more useful if Kate went next . ami_da_6
C 802.53 You can even have them in different flavours as well . ami_da_6
C 820.93 So that if you just want to sit there and chew on the remote , it could be like pear flavour , ami_da_6
C 820.93 yeah . ami_da_9
D 824.45 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 824.88 Or s or smelly . ami_da_6
D 826.61 Scratchy ami_da_6
D 826.61 well ami_da_2
D 826.61 I was really thinking a lot about the I the iMac kind of gel gem tone . ami_da_6
C 827.06 Scratch and sniff . ami_da_9
D 837.73 It is hot on the streets , guys . ami_da_4
B 838.69 Right , well ami_da_2
B 838.69 I ami_da_3
B 838.69 I ami_da_3
B 838.69 I think some of this ami_da_3
B 838.69 you are going to be a little disappointed with some of the things I have to tell you , but I am afraid this is the real world . ami_da_4
B 846.56 So ami_da_2
B 846.56 I have been looking at the the basics of how these devices actually have to work in order to operate , and I have had some discussions with the ma manufacturing division , who have told me what is actually available , you know , what the current state of the art in components is , and some of the exciting new things they have got , but I am not sure that it is quite what you want ami_da_4
B 871.1 Now ami_da_2
B 871.1 this is not a very good overhead , ami_da_9
B 871.1 but this is just to show you , this is the innards of a remote control . ami_da_4
B 878.92 I really need a pen or something ami_da_4
B 878.92 but ami_da_3
B 878.92 does my mouse work ? ami_da_5
B 878.92 No . ami_da_4
B 882.81 oh ami_da_2
B 882.81 yeah , ami_da_9
B 882.81 can you see my little mouse pointer ? ami_da_5
B 882.81 Right . ami_da_2
B 886.55 This is this is the a a a remote that is been opened up and that is the the back of the interface . ami_da_4
B 894.29 And this is a push button one , so you see these little little buttons here , they are little rubber rubber buttons that go through onto the the board at the back and they push these buttons here . ami_da_4
B 907.63 and we ami_da_3
B 907.63 that is the basic construction that we have got to got to accommodate . ami_da_4
B 914.04 We got to have something that pushes the little buttons that talk to the chip that encodes the message that sends the the message to the receiver . ami_da_4
B 925.46 So ami_da_2
B 925.46 I wan I want to go through not not just addressing the the the points that you made , Sarah , but doing my presentation in the order I wrote it . ami_da_7
B 939.61 So first of all I want to talk about what possibilities we have got for the energy source . ami_da_7
B 944.39 we can have your bog standard double double A batteries in a replaceable little compartment . ami_da_4
B 952.15 We can have a hand ami_da_4
B 952.15 sorry ami_da_14
B 952.15 a wind up , yeah , ami_da_4
B 952.15 which I think is quite an interesting concept for a sorry for a remote control , but i it maybe is does not quite go with the the fruit and veg . ami_da_9
C 954.47 A wind up . ami_da_12
B 973.67 one that one that I think is quite interesting is the kinetic energy source , ami_da_9
B 973.67 where you you actually get the energy by moving the device , ami_da_4
B 973.67 which is quite a ni a nice and neat one . ami_da_9
A 973.72 Alright . ami_da_1
A 977.27 Remember , ami_da_6
A 977.27 we only have forty minutes ami_da_4
B 984.71 You have to ami_da_3
B 984.71 it means that if it is sitting there for a long time it probably wo not work , ami_da_4
B 984.71 but you have to sort of throw it between your hands every now and then , ami_da_6
B 984.71 it will work . ami_da_4
B 991.22 Or we we had talked about solar power , ami_da_4
B 991.22 but I thing that we agreed that that is not so good in the dark . ami_da_9
B 999.01 Now ami_da_2
B 999.01 I am afraid this is the options we have got on on the case . ami_da_4
B 1002.75 It can be made of plastic , rubber , wood o if you like , or titanium . ami_da_4
B 1011.2 and the nearest we have got to st to spongy there ami_da_4
B 1011.2 I guess is rubber , ami_da_4
B 1011.2 but I am going to come back to the advantages of titanium , ami_da_7
B 1011.2 and basically it can have a flat surface , a curved surface or a double curved surface , but I think if we want to use standard components , we are going to have difficulty with anything much beyond that . ami_da_4
B 1034.15 Okay , ami_da_2
B 1034.15 what does the interface look like ? ami_da_4
B 1034.15 well ami_da_2
B 1034.15 push button , that is that is the one we are all familiar with . ami_da_4
B 1040.38 we can have scroll buttons and the the scroll button can incorporate a push , so you can have it like on a mouse where you can use it to go up and down , change volume or channel or something like that and push to select something . ami_da_4
B 1055.88 you can have multiple scroll buttons , ami_da_4
B 1055.88 this is maybe getting a little bit complicated , ami_da_9
B 1055.88 but it is it the technology is there . ami_da_4
B 1064.07 And we can also incorporate an LCD display in the remote , but this will increase the cost . ami_da_4
B 1073.22 the electronics that actually makes the device work , we have basically got three , simple , regular , advanced , and the price goes up as we choose each of this . ami_da_4
B 1082.74 If we want the nice cheap one , the simple , then we can only have push buttons . ami_da_4
B 1087.1 All the other fancy interface designs go out the window , I am afraid . ami_da_4
B 1090.74 pay a little bit more for a regular chip and you can have scroll buttons . ami_da_4
B 1096.75 If you want the advanced chip it obviously costs more , but it that is what you need if you want the LCD display . ami_da_4
B 1102.97 And the manufacturing devision tell me that they have recently developed sample sensor sample speaker devices . ami_da_4
B 1110.49 Now ami_da_2
B 1110.49 I do not know what that is , ami_da_4
B 1110.49 but I think they think it is quite important ami_da_9
B 1110.49 and we might want to incorporate it somewhere . ami_da_6
B 1118.81 ou our real expertise is in push buttons , I have to say , but maybe you think that is old technology . ami_da_4
B 1126.31 And well ami_da_2
B 1126.31 I I think we have got two options . ami_da_4
B 1129.2 We can either go for a really cheap model , keep all of the costs down , ami_da_6
B 1129.2 which means a flat plastic case with an ordinary battery and simple push buttons . ami_da_4
B 1138.79 Or we can have something that looks a bit nicer , I think it , wo not necessarily l look like a pineapple , ami_da_6
B 1138.79 but that may or may not be a good thing . ami_da_9
B 1151.59 Sorry . ami_da_14
B 1155.2 but it could have an LCD screen and it could have multiple scroll buttons , and it could have the the company is new development of the sample sensor and speaker . ami_da_6
B 1167.78 So , ami_da_2
B 1167.78 thank you . ami_da_14
D 1168.67 That sounds good . ami_da_9
D 1169.4 Any idea you ami_da_3
D 1169.4 you mentioned that there would be a cost difference . ami_da_4
D 1173.9 do you have any idea if if this could if the fancy model could be done in twelve Euros fifty ? ami_da_5
B 1183.26 Yeah , ami_da_2
B 1183.26 I am afraid I do not have that information available . ami_da_4
B 1185.59 manufacturing did not actually give attach any prices to any of this , I am afraid . ami_da_4
D 1192.72 Because , you know what , I am being quite serious when I say that that the things I mentioned are hot . ami_da_4
D 1200.46 But I think the important thing might be to choose one . ami_da_9
D 1205.73 You know , if if what you are telling me is is some of these things are not just f are not feasible , maybe we could something about naming , we could call it , you know , Blackberry . ami_da_6
B 1206.02 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 1214.36 That is ami_da_3
D 1214.36 Alright , ami_da_12
D 1214.36 well ami_da_2
D 1214.36 let is see then . ami_da_9
C 1214.48 Bear bear in mind it has to be the colours and styles of the company , ami_da_4
C 1214.48 so what I had been thinking was something chunky and yellow and plastic with black buttons with a logo on it . ami_da_6
B 1227.31 Banana ? ami_da_5
B 1227.31 We we could we could do a double curved rubber one , ami_da_6
B 1227.31 which would allow say a banana , but unfortunately I see from my notes that if we do that , we have to have a push button as the interface , we ca not do anything fancier . ami_da_4
C 1229.36 But ami_da_2
C 1229.36 I I do not know how important that is to keep it exactly the colours of the Real Reaction company . ami_da_9
D 1236.37 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 1240.04 It is just what I would understood we would be doing . ami_da_4
D 1241.86 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 1242.32 That is before I heard about all this hot tips about the future , fruit wise . ami_da_4
D 1246.61 But yeah , ami_da_2
D 1246.61 I am trying to streamline mine a little bit . ami_da_7
D 1259.2 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 1262.12 Shall we wait until I have until I have showed you what well , my extensive presentation on what sort of interfaces are available . ami_da_11
D 1263.51 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 1272.75 Yep . ami_da_9
D 1275.7 Thank you , Kate . ami_da_14
A 1277.33 Thank you , Kate . ami_da_14
C 1280.39 You did seem to include just in more detail what I have got though . ami_da_4
C 1284.31 So so mine is a bit pointless . ami_da_9
C 1291.53 Right . ami_da_2
C 1293.68 FN and F eight , did you say ? ami_da_5
C 1293.68 I do not have it on mine though . ami_da_4
A 1296.1 Yes . ami_da_4
A 1313.98 There we go . ami_da_9
D 1320.8 Oh ami_da_2
D 1320.8 I think Florence resolved it by ami_da_3
D 1320.8 F eight again . ami_da_6
B 1324.74 I If you do F FN F eight again , it is it will ami_da_6
B 1324.74 I think it ami_da_3
B 1324.74 yeah , you you will do an ami_da_3
A 1326.55 Do it again . ami_da_6
A 1329.23 Keep doing it until you get it in both ami_da_6
A 1329.23 you get it there , you get it yours without that one , and then you get it with both . ami_da_4
C 1345.97 Should I do it again ? ami_da_11
C 1345.97 Right then . ami_da_2
D 1348.47 Maybe . ami_da_9
A 1348.69 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 1354.61 This time it should come up both . ami_da_4
C 1367.94 I do not actually have a huge amount of different information then what Kate says , just that my method was to look at the , well , my my inspirations , which was a big collection of lots of different models of remote controls and other things that use a similar sort of thing , including MP three players , like you know , hi fi remotes , not just television and these things . ami_da_4
A 1372.13 Okay . ami_da_1
C 1397.61 having a think about the feature of ea the features of each ones , what functions we actually need , and then how to group and arrange these on the actual the actual plastic or rubber hand held piece . ami_da_4
C 1414.01 I have been especially interested in the iPod style scroll wheel , ami_da_9
C 1414.01 which ami_da_3
C 1414.01 Well , ami_da_2
C 1414.01 I could not find a ami_da_3
C 1414.01 the picture of the iPod w only linked to a web browser , so I could not copy and paste it , but it had a similar thing to this thing on the right . ami_da_4
C 1430.37 It has scroll wheels without without a display , but they they scroll like a computer mouse . ami_da_4
C 1439.98 So I was thinking that a really simple a really simple interface with just a couple of scroll things on it and then instead of a display the display could appear on the television screen . ami_da_6
C 1456.32 Like I guess an existing Sky or cable one does . ami_da_4
C 1463.08 Like , you know , ami_da_2
C 1463.08 you press enter and it comes up with what is showing on that channel at the moment , ami_da_4
C 1463.08 and you can do ami_da_3
C 1463.08 you can scroll along and it will show you what is on in the next half hour , and you scroll up and you can see what is on the other channels while you are watching the same channel on the screen . ami_da_4
C 1479.25 but I am also equally taken with this chunky plastic kiddie remote , which is really nice and fun and good to hold and nice , big , easy buttons to press , ami_da_9
C 1479.25 but still quite simple and quite cost effective . ami_da_4
C 1499.45 So ami_da_2
C 1499.45 what seems kind of ideal for me would be to just have a fairly simple , not fancy but not totally minimalist , ami_da_6
C 1499.45 I mean just pretty simple plastic , probably , I was thinking , yellow and black , ami_da_6
C 1499.45 just because that is the company is colours , ami_da_4
C 1499.45 with very very few buttons , but that would correspond to a screen that would appear on the television screen , like , you know , just small along the bottom ami_da_6
C 1499.45 instead of instead of having the iPod style display screen on the actual remotes , which is far too expensive . ami_da_9
C 1541.87 And when you have got a screen sitting there in front of you , you might as well have it appearing on the screen in front of you , ami_da_6
C 1541.87 it does not obscure much of the actual picture you are watching . ami_da_4
B 1548.96 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 1550.27 And so on that you can , just much in the same way as an existing Sky remote , scroll along , scroll up and down . ami_da_4
B 1560.77 Yeah , I would I would certainly support that idea . ami_da_9
C 1561.67 And and I definitely support the use of plastic and or rubber . ami_da_9
C 1569.06 I mean titanium would be great , but I think it might be a bit too expensive and too kind of spacey . ami_da_9
C 1577.63 If we are k trying to keep it colourful and slightly organic , then I think titanium is too futuristic . ami_da_9
B 1586.45 It is difficult to make fancy shapes in it as well , we ca not for example have a double curved case in titanium unfortunately . ami_da_4
C 1589.38 Yeah . ami_da_9
C 1593.36 Whereas a plastic is so cheap and easy and mouldable and everything else . ami_da_4
C 1601.46 then ami_da_3
C 1601.46 And it is a little bit pointless as well I think . ami_da_9
B 1603.77 And the the having the the the screen on the television screen I think is a good idea , ami_da_9
B 1603.77 because otherwise we are we are putting up the price not only for putting building the LCD in , but for the electronics as well . ami_da_4
D 1617.3 It is a duplication . ami_da_4
C 1617.37 Like ami_da_2
C 1617.37 when when when you have got when you have got the screen there , it does not have to be anything fancy , ami_da_6
C 1617.37 just a little menu showing ami_da_3
C 1617.37 yeah , ami_da_2
C 1617.37 a menu , you go into one menu and then it can have your different options , whether you want to change the settings or ami_da_6
C 1617.37 the you know , your information about programme that is on at the moment . ami_da_6
B 1617.39 There is that . ami_da_9
C 1634.27 I do not think that is to taxing to s engineer . ami_da_4
C 1642.86 But as for actually arranging them let me go back to the to the picture of the kiddie one . ami_da_7
C 1655.82 And I quite like it , ami_da_9
C 1655.82 because it is just smooth and hand held and it is got these easily reachable buttons that quite nicely spaced out , ami_da_4
C 1655.82 so something a bit like that with buttons arranged in a kind of circle . ami_da_6
C 1672.7 Up , down , left , right . ami_da_6
B 1674.04 Do you want scroll buttons in that as well ? ami_da_5
C 1676.12 I I was thinking not actually scroll , like a like mouse scroll , ami_da_4
C 1676.12 but you know , a ami_da_3
C 1676.12 I ca not quite d describe it . ami_da_4
C 1686.31 you see on the one on the right , down at the bottom , is the mouse . ami_da_6
C 1690.64 Yeah , ami_da_2
C 1690.64 see where the mouse is , ami_da_5
C 1690.64 like this s style thing where you c have up , down , left and right . ami_da_6
B 1697.09 Right . ami_da_12
C 1698.85 And enter in the middle , so you pick your menu and then your different options and when when you click on each one , it you can go into a new menu for that . ami_da_6
C 1709.11 I am getting a bit specific here . ami_da_4
C 1711.87 Really we would have to use something to show you , ami_da_6
C 1711.87 but If ami_da_3
C 1711.87 I do not think I can get it up on the screen . ami_da_4
B 1712.6 Yeah . ami_da_2
B 1713.15 I think I think that is a g nice clean design , ami_da_9
B 1713.15 it is playing to our strengths which are in push button technology . ami_da_4
D 1719.46 To m make it . ami_da_3
C 1722.48 here we go . ami_da_9
C 1723.35 Right . ami_da_2
D 1723.92 Oh ami_da_2
D 1723.92 nice . ami_da_9
C 1725.9 Well , ami_da_2
C 1725.9 the iPod spinning wheel is really complicated . ami_da_9
A 1731.25 Huh . ami_da_1
C 1731.72 It does scroll , ami_da_4
C 1731.72 but it is hugely complicated . ami_da_9
B 1731.98 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 1735.66 What else have we got ? ami_da_5
C 1735.66 Them , they are terrible . ami_da_9
D 1738.08 Wow . ami_da_9
C 1741.77 But they all have this this feature of this ami_da_4
C 1741.77 It is not quite a scroll wheel , but it is a kind of selection in this circle , ami_da_4
C 1741.77 which I think is a really good idea . ami_da_9
A 1749.62 It is a selection wheel . ami_da_4
B 1754.21 But we can implement it with simple push buttons , ami_da_6
B 1754.21 which is much cheaper . ami_da_4
C 1756.63 Yeah , ami_da_9
C 1756.63 like up , down , left and right . ami_da_6
C 1761.03 Which is good . ami_da_9
C 1761.44 And then and then ami_da_3
C 1761.44 Yeah , so I mean ami_da_2
C 1761.44 either a channel up and down , volume up and down , next appearing programmes up and down , and then also when you get into the different menus on the screen , it is got your things like settings and contrast up and down . ami_da_6
A 1781.32 Okay . ami_da_1
C 1782.12 So all you really need is these four buttons with the enter in the middle . ami_da_4
A 1786.99 Okay . ami_da_1
C 1788.96 And that is it . ami_da_4
B 1792.65 In fact ami_da_3
B 1792.65 Oh ami_da_2
B 1792.65 that is really nice . ami_da_9
C 1792.99 Look at look at this one . ami_da_6
C 1799.68 Almost impossible to misplace or l or lose . ami_da_14
D 1803.01 Do you think with ami_da_3
D 1803.01 It seems that that you guys are quite keen on the plastic , perhaps the something reminiscent of the child is remote . ami_da_4
C 1803.89 Might take up your whole living room . ami_da_14
D 1814.28 Do you think we could put it in a in a fruit colour ? ami_da_11
D 1814.28 And have it abstract . ami_da_11
D 1821.02 You know , ami_da_2
D 1821.02 we could call like a fruit name , but it would be a little more abstract . ami_da_6
C 1821.63 Possibly . ami_da_9
C 1822.94 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 1825.95 That also is possible . ami_da_9
B 1826.17 We we could actually do it in rubber instead of plastic if you would rather if you feel if you like the spongy ami_da_6
D 1829.58 I am just just throwing out ideas . ami_da_4
C 1829.62 Just ami_da_3
C 1829.62 just something else I need to bring to your attention ami_da_7
C 1829.62 is have you have you seen these on a remote ? ami_da_5
C 1829.62 This is actually the volume up and down , but they both say V on them , which , when you first look at it , you expect that to be the down , because it looks like a downward pointing arrow , but it is actually the V to indicate that it is the volume , ami_da_4
C 1829.62 so we do need to avoid little ambiguities like these . ami_da_6
A 1830.38 Or call it a or call it a banana and have it in yellow . ami_da_6
D 1834.24 Yeah . ami_da_2
D 1834.59 I am thinking maybe we need to be a little bit more abstract if the design constraints are so ami_da_6
A 1839.67 Okay . ami_da_9
B 1840.15 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 1857.62 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 1867.97 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 1869.02 Nice . ami_da_9
D 1870.16 Good point . ami_da_9
C 1871.48 But we would not have a specific volume up and down . ami_da_6
C 1874.49 If we are having the scroll wheel , then it is going to double up as all the other up and down functions . ami_da_6
A 1881.46 okay . ami_da_1
C 1882.12 But then , that is complicated . ami_da_9
A 1884.3 I want to thank you all for all your presentations . ami_da_14
A 1887.66 We have about ten minutes left , ami_da_4
A 1887.66 in which time we have to make some decisions on the remote control concepts . ami_da_6
A 1895.27 and I think you all have been self stimulating of working together . ami_da_4
A 1902.73 we need to come up with some specifics of the components , the materials , things like making the decision on the energy and the case and the interface type things . ami_da_6
A 1919.8 So ami_da_2
A 1919.8 let is ami_da_3
A 1926.76 Right . ami_da_2
A 1931.59 They want us to decide what form of energy are we going to use , which the choices that we have discussed were pretty much battery , kinetic or solar . ami_da_4
A 1948.18 this is where Kate is expertise comes in , ami_da_4
A 1948.18 and our decision making will be a little bit guided by Kate at this point . ami_da_6
A 1958.6 The ami_da_3
A 1958.6 You were saying that the kinetic would be useful , that is you just have to move it some ami_da_4
A 1958.6 and you would be able to use it as opposed to a battery that you have to either put it in a recharger or keep replacing the batteries . ami_da_4
A 1975.42 or solar that you would have difficulty with it if it is a dark day , that it will die on you , and no way to do it . ami_da_4
A 1983.82 That is the day you want to use the TV . ami_da_4
A 1986.22 so what is our pleasure here , what would be the cost consequences of each of the three ? ami_da_5
A 1986.22 Okay . ami_da_12
B 1994.66 Oh ami_da_2
B 1994.66 unfortunately I do not have costing information . ami_da_4
B 1997.81 I i in terms of workability , I I think the the two front runners are the standard battery or the kinetic , ami_da_9
B 1997.81 but I am sorry ami_da_14
B 1997.81 I do not figures on the difference in cost . ami_da_4
A 2005.46 okay . ami_da_1
A 2008.53 What is the feelings of the group on the kinetic ? ami_da_11
D 2011.88 I have used kinetic in terms of watches ami_da_4
D 2011.88 and it is very very handy , ami_da_9
D 2011.88 you do not even notice that it is there . ami_da_4
C 2020.29 It sounds great . ami_da_9
C 2021.08 I have never come across it before , ami_da_4
C 2021.08 but it sounds fantastic . ami_da_9
C 2023.81 Sounds like it could be g a really good economical it would make the whole thing a lot lighter , more convenient . ami_da_9
D 2023.86 It is ami_da_3
D 2030.95 It could tie in with the fanciful design ami_da_6
D 2030.95 as ami_da_3
D 2030.95 , you know , ami_da_2
D 2030.95 throw the banana , you know , just gotta keep it moving . ami_da_6
C 2033.62 Yeah . ami_da_9
C 2034.87 Because it is really a quite attractive thought , ami_da_9
C 2034.87 is not it ? ami_da_11
C 2034.87 It is like ami_da_3
C 2034.87 yeah , ami_da_2
C 2034.87 a good selling point . ami_da_9
A 2039.58 So the consensus seems to be use the kinetic if it is at all possible . ami_da_4
D 2039.65 Be ami_da_3
D 2039.65 Yeah . ami_da_9
C 2043.62 But it does depend how much I mean how much it costs and how much more development and research it needs . ami_da_9
A 2045.43 It costs . ami_da_4
B 2050.21 And and how much you do have to keep it moving , ami_da_9
B 2050.21 because I am conscious that watching TV can be quite a sed sedentary activity . ami_da_4
D 2052.79 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 2057.12 But I could market that as a as a a I was thinking actually a a cost saver down the road , in terms of battery , you know . ami_da_7
C 2060.04 Do your exercises while you are watching the TV . ami_da_6
B 2061.2 Yeah . ami_da_9
B 2067.43 True , yeah , ami_da_9
B 2067.43 m more more environmentally friendly . ami_da_6
C 2069.91 Yeah , that is what I was thinking as well . ami_da_9
A 2070.56 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 2071.11 You know , ami_da_2
D 2071.11 kind of the ami_da_3
D 2071.11 That is exactly what I was thinking . ami_da_9
A 2072.46 Thanks for the reminder for five minutes to finish , thanks . ami_da_14
A 2076.1 the next thing that they wanted us to do was look at chip on print as a decision . ami_da_6
B 2092.06 Oh right , okay , ami_da_2
B 2092.06 I would ami_da_3
B 2092.06 that that is something I maybe should have covered . ami_da_7
B 2095.36 chip on print is just a manufacturing technique ami_da_4
B 2095.36 and I would certainly recommend it , I think , ami_da_6
B 2095.36 because I am not sure I have an alternative . ami_da_4
A 2100.12 Oh . ami_da_12
A 2107.51 Okay . ami_da_12
B 2111.08 I i it ami_da_4
B 2111.08 it is just the way that the the the th the way it is ac it is actually built and ami_da_4
B 2111.08 you you print onto the circuit board like you might print onto paper . ami_da_4
A 2111.56 What about the ca ami_da_3
A 2111.56 yeah . ami_da_1
A 2113.07 Oh , ami_da_2
A 2113.07 the way we ami_da_3
A 2113.07 uh huh . ami_da_1
A 2119.83 Oh , okay . ami_da_12
A 2122.07 what about the case ? ami_da_8
A 2122.07 I think they are talking there about do we want wood , plastic , titanium or rubber , and I think we have discussed not having titanium . ami_da_4
A 2133.17 One , it is too expensive , and second , it wo not do this double curves . ami_da_4
A 2140.05 we have sort of eliminated wood . ami_da_4
A 2142.26 We said plastic or rubber . ami_da_4
A 2143.92 What is the pleasure ? ami_da_8
A 2143.92 What about you ? ami_da_11
A 2143.92 Cover . ami_da_4
B 2147.26 Well ami_da_2
B 2147.26 if if Sarah is keen on a spongy feel , the the rubber that we are talking about is the same as you have in those little stress balls , ami_da_4
B 2147.26 so it is ami_da_3
B 2147.26 yeah . ami_da_1
D 2157.35 I am sold . ami_da_9
C 2160.55 Do you not think it might need like a kind of a hard plastic inner shell with the actual delicate workings inside , and then a kind of spongy ami_da_11
C 2160.55 Yeah , s thick spongy cover , ami_da_11
C 2160.55 so it feels like the whole thing is spongy , but actually you are not damaging anything by squeezing it . ami_da_4
D 2173.57 Kind of like an internal egg . ami_da_5
A 2181.4 Plastic inside . ami_da_14
D 2183.65 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 2185.8 Because I mean you could just get carried away with the with the tac ami_da_3
C 2185.8 Yeah . ami_da_9
B 2185.99 Yeah . ami_da_2
B 2186.83 I would I would need to talk to manufacturing again about whether that is actually possible , ami_da_7
B 2186.83 but I agree , it is sounds like a nice idea if it is . ami_da_9
C 2191.6 Well ami_da_2
C 2191.6 you do get a bit carried away with things that are tactile , you just want to stroke them and squeeze them , ami_da_4
C 2191.6 and ami_da_3
C 2191.6 Just copy the one on the left . ami_da_6
D 2196.94 And with sports on television . ami_da_4
A 2197.46 Okay . ami_da_1
D 2200.13 You know . ami_da_2
A 2200.73 the next part they want is the user interface concept . ami_da_6
D 2201.3 I su ami_da_3
D 2201.3 Then I will just say I support either from a marketing point of view I support either decision that the designers make on that . ami_da_9
B 2201.38 I should I should r ami_da_3
B 2201.38 Which I think technically is just push button ami_da_4
B 2201.38 and I would certainly support that that ami_da_9
B 2201.38 that brings the cost down quite a lot and it is something that we are an ex the company is an expert on . ami_da_4
A 2204.45 I am sorry to push you , ami_da_14
A 2204.45 but we only have a couple minutes to finish with . ami_da_4
A 2213.77 Okay , ami_da_12
A 2213.77 and it says interface . ami_da_8
A 2215.61 What type and what supplements ? ami_da_8
A 2215.61 Okay , ami_da_2
A 2215.61 that is that . ami_da_4
C 2224.19 No ami_da_9
C 2224.19 a scroll ami_da_3
C 2224.19 Well , ami_da_2
C 2224.19 like four buttons , up , down , left and right with enter in the middle , that will correspond to a menu on the screen . ami_da_6
C 2237.06 Yeah , ami_da_2
C 2237.06 I would like push buttons with ami_da_3
C 2237.06 So ami_da_2
C 2237.06 push buttons ami_da_6
C 2237.06 No , ami_da_9
C 2237.06 it is still it is still plugged in on mine actually . ami_da_4
A 2254.05 this is going to sound weird , ami_da_9
A 2254.05 but the next meeting starts in thirty minutes . ami_da_4
A 2259.84 Whew . ami_da_16
A 2260.92 And they actually want a look and feel design , user interface design , you can look and see this as well as I can . ami_da_4
A 2268.06 Marketing they want product evaluation . ami_da_4
D 2269.79 No we ca not , actually . ami_da_9
A 2270.91 Oh . ami_da_12
A 2272.26 Oh my , I am sorry . ami_da_14
D 2274.88 That is why I was looking over your shoulder ami_da_4
A 2276.34 Oh , okay . ami_da_12
A 2278.82 Sorry about that . ami_da_14
A 2279.8 missed that one . ami_da_4
A 2286.43 This ought to be fun trying to get this thing to work . ami_da_16
A 2290.26 , ta da . ami_da_16
C 2293.02 Now it is gone again . ami_da_4
B 2301.2 You know , ami_da_2
A 2306.04 Yes , ami_da_9
A 2306.04 because I ca not even see mine . ami_da_4
A 2309.62 Next meeting starts in thirty minutes , these are the individual actions . ami_da_4
C 2311.31 Oh yes . ami_da_9
A 2314.29 Yeah , right . ami_da_16
A 2315.46 the look and feel design is for Kate , Steph gets the user interface design , you get product evaluation . ami_da_4
A 2327.96 the two of you get to play with a Pla modelling clay to do a prototype . ami_da_4
