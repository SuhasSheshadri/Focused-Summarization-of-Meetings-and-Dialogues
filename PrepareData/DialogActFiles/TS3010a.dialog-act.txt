A 592.57 So ami_da_6
A 592.57 F first . ami_da_3
C 593.28 I will start . ami_da_7
C 594.14 Big one , they are not easy to use . ami_da_4
C 599.62 I have one set and a remote control , when I dropped it , it broke . ami_da_4
C 605.16 So that wo not be our goal , I think . ami_da_4
B 608.75 No . ami_da_1
C 609.74 And g big buttons , ami_da_4
C 609.74 m that is easier to use than I think . ami_da_9
C 617.69 Not all the small buttons , you do not know Big buttons , positive . ami_da_4
A 618.76 Is this positive or negative , that big buttons ? ami_da_5
A 618.76 Positive . ami_da_9
C 624.06 All all small buttons like when you have like a hundred buttons on your remote control , you wo not know what they are working for . ami_da_4
A 631.01 Okay . ami_da_2
A 632.37 What are your experiences ? ami_da_5
B 634.48 well I think the the the goal of a remote control is that it is it it has an influence on the TV set . ami_da_4
B 641.18 And that it controls the channels and the the volume . ami_da_4
B 644.87 And I I ami_da_4
B 644.87 I think it is positive if there is a a LED a LED on the corner of the of the remote . ami_da_4
B 654.79 So that you know it s it still has batteries on it in it . ami_da_4
B 658.72 And that if you push the button the LED gives a light , and and you see that it is working . ami_da_4
B 665.64 And yeah . ami_da_1
B 666.68 Yeah , but ami_da_3
B 666.68 No no no . ami_da_4
A 669.35 So and do they always have that ? ami_da_5
A 669.35 It is easy to you . ami_da_4
B 673.35 But I my my experience is that it ami_da_4
B 673.35 it ami_da_4
B 673.35 it is convenient to have that . ami_da_4
B 677.77 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 678.29 Okay . ami_da_9
B 678.69 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 680.32 Okay . ami_da_6
D 682.28 at home we have a TV , a video recorder , a DVD player , and a satellite receiver . ami_da_4
D 688.72 We have four distinctive remote controls for that . ami_da_4
C 691.44 Thank you . ami_da_14
D 692.37 That is not really ea easy . ami_da_4
C 694.61 Help also . ami_da_14
D 695.06 So it would be nice if we have one for all . ami_da_4
C 697.2 Thank you . ami_da_14
D 697.68 And we also had a remote control for our radio set . ami_da_4
D 701.27 But i it it had a lot of buttons on it , and you did not know which one was what . ami_da_4
D 708.11 And it was v not easy to use . ami_da_4
D 710.95 So we n barely used it . ami_da_4
A 712.9 Okay so they have too much . ami_da_4
A 715.21 So next . ami_da_16
A 716.44 For our own remote control we have to think how do we make it . ami_da_4
A 721.51 So what ideas do you have for it , for the new remote control ? ami_da_8
A 721.51 What what does it have to have ? ami_da_8
A 721.51 Not too heavy . ami_da_9
C 733.5 The weight . ami_da_6
C 733.97 Not not too heavy . ami_da_6
C 742.34 Not much buttons . ami_da_6
A 742.38 Yes . ami_da_1
A 754.76 Yeah . ami_da_8
C 755.16 Bust free . ami_da_6
C 756.0 That when you drop it , it wo not break . ami_da_4
C 758.17 Like some kind of rubber on it . ami_da_6
C 760.15 Or hard hard plastic . ami_da_6
C 764.56 buttons not too small . ami_da_6
C 775.25 something like when you lose your remote control , sometimes it happen . ami_da_4
A 780.5 Yes . ami_da_1
C 780.88 it between the couch and you ca not find it . ami_da_4
C 782.85 When you push a but a button on the TV , then you hear some some sort of bleep . ami_da_6

B 835.39 no . ami_da_9
