A 31.39 Okay . ami_da_5
A 33.23 So we are here for the concept design meeting . ami_da_4
A 38.95 So , we will first start by summarizing the the previous meeting and the decision we have taken . ami_da_4
A 48.31 I will take notes during this meeting so that you can look at my folder to see the summary of this meeting afterwards . ami_da_4
A 59.08 So each of you will show us the various investigation they have done during previous hours . ami_da_4
A 72.61 We will then t take decision in concert and then we will define the nest next task , to have to be done before the next meeting . ami_da_4
A 85.55 So , last time we decided to have a simple interface . ami_da_4
A 91.89 We also decided to have a wheel to change channel previous channel button . ami_da_4
A 97.79 Channel digit buttons should be protected by plastic cover or something for the remote control to look very simple . ami_da_4
A 108.75 We have also button for volume , and to switch on off the TV . ami_da_4
A 115.44 We have also the lightening feature for the remote control to be easy to find , and for fast development and low cost we have decided to have no LCD no voice features . ami_da_4
A 131.09 So now we will have three presentations . ami_da_4
A 135.18 So the conceptual specification by Industrial Designer , the specification of the UI by or UI ami_da_4
A 135.18 okay . ami_da_16
C 145.32 Abdul al Hasred is my name . ami_da_4
A 150.65 And the last point is trend watching by Market Expert . ami_da_4
A 157.29 So maybe we can start with industrial design . ami_da_6
A 164.02 So this is the presentation . ami_da_4
B 167.74 , ID you want ? ami_da_5
B 167.74 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 172.92 Maybe I can switch slide on your request . ami_da_7
B 175.38 I only v have three slides , so . ami_da_4
B 177.43 I just look at the just this . ami_da_4
B 183.37 On some web pages to find some documentation ami_da_4
B 183.37 and I think a remote control is , as I s mentioned previously ami_da_4
B 183.37 , you just have a a very simple chip and the the user interface is just done usually by push button and in our case we are using a a wheel control . ami_da_4
A 185.22 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 204.46 So I was looking basically for that chip , which is very very standard , and I just looked for the wheel sensor and the standard push button . ami_da_4
B 217.02 And ami_da_2
B 217.02 yeah we can change directly . ami_da_6
A 221.29 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 221.34 In fact I have the number of that element which is very standard for remote control . ami_da_4
B 229.13 The push button are usually extremely cheap , but I just have one problem and this is related with the wheel sensor , which seems to be quite expensive . ami_da_4
A 238.83 Okay . ami_da_1
B 239.36 And I think we if we could just talk about that if we really need a wheel sensor or if we can not if if we could combine something with the push button . ami_da_6
A 250.86 Okay . ami_da_9
B 251.51 a wheel sensor is fifty time the price of a a a push button . ami_da_4
C 251.72 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 257.16 But is it a significant price on the whole remote control ? ami_da_5
A 257.16 Because we can afford up to twelve Euros for the price of the remote control . ami_da_4
B 263.47 Yeah . ami_da_2
B 269.01 Yeah ami_da_4
B 269.01 I I th ami_da_3
B 269.01 But I do not think that we should ami_da_3
B 269.01 We should talk about the design of the box also which needs some money . ami_da_6
A 269.64 So will will will this with including all possible things , so buttons , wheel and the chip , be lower than twelve Euros to produce ? ami_da_5
A 269.64 Okay ami_da_9
A 269.64 You received something ami_da_5
C 286.43 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 288.95 Also have to say ami_da_7
C 288.95 Did you receive the email about the voice recognition ? ami_da_5
C 288.95 No ? ami_da_5
C 288.95 Yeah . ami_da_4
B 289.77 But that is all ami_da_3
B 289.77 yeah . ami_da_4
B 299.42 I have not chec ami_da_4
C 300.74 You we an email from the manufacturing division that they have basically a voice recognition chip already developed . ami_da_4
C 308.7 Says ami_da_3
C 308.7 Yeah . ami_da_9
C 311.61 It says that ri right now they just use it to to record answers to particular questions . ami_da_4
C 318.87 But I guess it could be ami_da_3
C 318.87 I guess it is possible . ami_da_4
A 319.76 And could it be adapted ? ami_da_5
A 319.76 Okay and there can recognize some commands and stuff ? ami_da_5
A 319.76 Okay . ami_da_1
C 322.66 I mean instead of recording the answers you can just record something simpler like a command . ami_da_4
C 330.56 Yeah you reco recognize commands and you can record new commands and stuff , ami_da_4
C 330.56 so if they already have it as as a chip then we we could use it . ami_da_6
A 337.25 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 338.71 Okay maybe we can just listen to this presentation and then take decision later on according to those news . ami_da_6
C 344.11 Okay . ami_da_9
B 345.45 Yeah ami_da_9
B 345.45 but I think it is yeah ami_da_3
B 345.45 Sorry , ami_da_14
B 345.45 I have not written my personal references . ami_da_4
B 350.9 the I I just want to mention the the problem of the the r wheels sensor which is much more expensive than any push button , ami_da_4
B 350.9 and if we could reduce that . ami_da_6
A 362.42 Okay . ami_da_1
B 365.64 We we have already some good things with with the backlight of the push button . ami_da_4
C 375.27 I have a question about that actually . ami_da_7
C 377.68 , what is the purpose of the light ? ami_da_5
C 377.68 Is But ami_da_2
C 377.68 But in th in the dark ami_da_3
C 377.68 Yeah but is going to be always turned on , the light ? ami_da_5
C 377.68 But if you move it then you have it , you do not need to find it . ami_da_4
B 381.81 Just to to make something which is slightly more design that a squarey box with a rubber ami_da_4
B 381.81 Yeah . ami_da_16
A 387.81 You can easily find the button in the dark or so ? ami_da_4
A 387.81 It will be turned on when the when the user move the remote control I think , ami_da_4
A 387.81 no ? ami_da_5
C 407.73 You can see the buttons better , of course . ami_da_4
A 409.65 Yeah . ami_da_9
C 410.0 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 410.92 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 412.52 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 413.24 True . ami_da_9
B 414.88 Actually . ami_da_16
C 415.02 But if you move it then you have to have some sensor to when you move it to detect your movement . ami_da_4
B 422.1 As soon as you thought to move the the remote control you have the light . ami_da_4
C 426.3 Yeah , ami_da_9
C 426.3 but you need another sensor for that , right ? ami_da_5
C 426.3 Yeah ami_da_9
C 426.3 no it is too expensive . ami_da_5
B 429.09 Yeah . ami_da_4
B 429.92 Again . ami_da_4
B 437.36 I do not think that this is really expensive , but at the end this is plenty of unexpen eh very cheap devices but the bill starts to be First of all I was thinking to have a a continuous light and you w when t you you you you press the on button ami_da_4
B 437.36 you have the light on your remote control , when you want to turn off your device ami_da_4
B 437.36 Yeah , a little bit . ami_da_4
C 439.26 Okay . ami_da_1
C 444.74 Extra . ami_da_4
C 445.55 Yeah , okay . ami_da_9
C 449.41 Yeah , ami_da_4
C 449.41 but I expected also the wheel would be cheap but ami_da_4
C 449.41 you tell me that it is very expensive so , ami_da_4
C 449.41 yeah . ami_da_2
A 466.69 But it can be battery consuming , no ? ami_da_5
A 466.69 To have the light always on ? ami_da_5
A 466.69 Well we will discuss that after maybe the other presentations . ami_da_6
B 474.33 A little bit . ami_da_4
B 478.16 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 478.38 Okay ami_da_9
C 479.23 So my one , it should be in the shared folder . ami_da_4
A 484.07 Yeah . ami_da_9
C 484.22 So . ami_da_2
C 486.12 It was last time I saw it . ami_da_4
A 490.26 And it is . ami_da_4
C 496.58 Okay . ami_da_9
C 501.4 So , ami_da_2
C 501.4 just move to the next slide . ami_da_6
A 502.16 Okay . ami_da_9
C 506.96 So basically want very simple , right ? ami_da_11
C 506.96 That is the major idea , as simple as possible . ami_da_4
A 512.69 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 513.47 Yeah . ami_da_9
C 514.31 So I just look at some current designs on the web , of usually more complicated remote controls . ami_da_4
C 521.34 And let is look at two of them because th even though they have many buttons ami_da_6
C 521.34 they look quite simple . ami_da_6
C 526.13 And in our case we just reject the buttons what we do not need ami_da_6
C 526.13 and it become even simpler . ami_da_6
A 530.12 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 533.02 So . ami_da_2
A 533.12 And also does it fit well in hand ? ami_da_5
A 533.12 Because it was th your wrist problem with the usage . ami_da_4
C 537.99 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 538.99 Well this these these remotes are quite big , ami_da_4
C 538.99 so go to the next page , ami_da_6
C 538.99 so . ami_da_2
C 545.07 We have all these buttons as you can see , but most of them , we just need the ones in the middle . ami_da_4
A 547.02 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 549.68 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 549.76 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 550.02 So , from the bottom or whatever is there , the the numbers and then the top , until the ten also , this middle part , and on the left one is exactly the same . ami_da_4
A 553.64 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 558.88 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 560.44 So it is basically more or less how we would like it , with a big volume control , big channel control , and mute and power , ami_da_4
C 560.44 yeah ? ami_da_11
C 560.44 These are the basic thing . ami_da_4
A 567.03 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 568.14 So it is only the central part . ami_da_12
C 570.0 So basically , w software we will build will look more or less the same as these two . ami_da_6
A 574.47 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 574.74 With a maybe a more ergonomic design on on the bottom part . ami_da_6
C 579.08 Yeah , ami_da_9
C 579.08 if you have , for example ami_da_3
C 579.08 I think that the volume and the buttons that are there on the top are not very easy to reach with your thumb . ami_da_4
C 585.48 It could be on the right side , for example . ami_da_6
A 585.58 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 588.06 Okay . ami_da_9
C 588.46 Yeah . ami_da_9
C 589.4 Because we do not have these input buttons and this other stuff that they have . ami_da_4
C 592.74 And I think that the plastic cover is not very good idea because you open it ami_da_4
C 592.74 , it can break , you ca you can do various things . ami_da_4
A 595.41 Okay . ami_da_1
C 601.05 you just need to put the channel numbers somewhere a bit out of the way . ami_da_6
A 601.14 Okay . ami_da_1
A 602.34 S ami_da_1
A 602.34 Okay . ami_da_9
C 607.72 So that they are separate a bit , ami_da_4
C 607.72 yeah . ami_da_11
A 607.81 Will be down or ami_da_3
A 607.81 Okay . ami_da_9
C 610.26 and it is easy to press the other the big buttons , but , it is not that difficult to press the the channel buttons either . ami_da_4
C 619.49 Yeah , I think that if you put the cover it will be even more difficult for the user . ami_da_4
A 622.76 Okay . ami_da_9
C 625.15 Alright , you wo not ami_da_3
C 625.15 yeah . ami_da_3
C 627.24 Usually what I have noticed that people put the plastic cover on things that you normally do not mess with , like buttons for t tuning the channels and stuff like that . ami_da_4
A 634.71 Okay . ami_da_1
C 636.46 Yeah . ami_da_9
C 637.06 That you want to protect a bit . ami_da_4
C 639.6 And I think it is it is reasonable . ami_da_9
A 642.05 Okay . ami_da_9
C 642.86 So , I do not think ami_da_3
C 642.86 Yeah , this is just the the wheel . ami_da_4
C 647.67 We could use the ami_da_3
C 647.67 some wheels can be pushed down , could use the push down of the wheel for the record if we want . ami_da_4
C 654.19 so we could just basically use one just wheel ami_da_6
C 654.19 and user could use just the wheel to do everything with the channels in that case . ami_da_4
A 661.0 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 664.23 Maybe the wheel will be a good advantage over our competitors . ami_da_4
A 670.79 Because otherwise it is pretty standard apart the fact that it is very simple . ami_da_4
A 675.97 So maybe it is worse to to have more expense on that is that aspect . ami_da_4
B 680.57 To s ami_da_3
C 685.45 Yeah , ami_da_9
C 685.45 I guess the market researcher will tell us all about that . ami_da_4
A 689.17 Okay . ami_da_2
A 691.13 So we can move to the ami_da_3
A 691.13 Is there any question ? ami_da_5
A 691.13 For designer of user interface ? ami_da_5
A 691.13 or we can move to the next part , maybe , and discuss afterwards ? ami_da_6
A 691.13 Okay . ami_da_16
D 714.38 Okay , I can go ? ami_da_5
D 714.38 Can I ? ami_da_5
D 714.38 So now the recent investigation we we have done fo of the remote control . ami_da_4
A 716.77 Yeah . ami_da_4
D 728.45 So , the most important aspect for remote controls is to be fancy look and feel and not current functional look and feel . ami_da_4
D 738.17 And the second aspect is that the remote control should be technological innovative . ami_da_4
A 746.76 Okay . ami_da_1
D 747.11 And the third most important aspect is to to is that the co remote control should be easy to use . ami_da_4
D 754.77 So , are things we are we have speak about before . ami_da_4
A 761.86 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 762.3 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 762.78 And so you you can go after . ami_da_6
A 766.63 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 769.59 And there is a fashion watchers in Paris and Milan that have detected the following trends , fruits and vegetables will be the most important theme for clothes , shoes , and furnitures . ami_da_4
D 782.91 So , maybe if our remote control have to be a fruit form or vegetable form something like that , or ami_da_6
D 782.91 And the the material is expected to be spongy . ami_da_4
A 791.65 Okay . ami_da_9
B 793.03 I support an apple . ami_da_6
D 800.82 I do not know which material can be spongy , ami_da_4
D 800.82 and if you ami_da_3
A 805.16 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 806.6 This is good also for ami_da_3
A 806.6 Yeah . ami_da_9
C 807.11 Well , wou wou ami_da_2
C 807.11 I think we can certainly just put the electronics in a spongy thing , ami_da_4
C 807.11 it it would work , right ? ami_da_11
C 807.11 Yeah . ami_da_9
B 812.66 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 813.7 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 814.49 I think it is good also f to have a spongy material , ami_da_4
A 814.49 yeah . ami_da_4
C 817.21 You can throw it to the television . ami_da_4
A 818.99 Yeah , because it is robust . ami_da_9
D 819.37 Okay ami_da_1
D 819.37 It is robust , yeah . ami_da_9
B 819.96 Yeah . ami_da_9
B 820.29 Me too . ami_da_9
C 821.58 Hey ami_da_16
C 821.58 that is a cool one . ami_da_9
C 822.97 We could say that if you throw it , you have a sensor , and you throw it and hits the television and turns it off . ami_da_6
C 829.63 When it d takes a shock . ami_da_4
A 831.8 Yeah ami_da_1
A 831.8 sorry ? ami_da_14
A 831.8 No . ami_da_5
B 832.22 it is okay . ami_da_1
D 832.28 Not good . ami_da_9
B 833.18 I know that they do that for alarm clock also . ami_da_4
D 835.39 An and and this you can ami_da_2
D 835.39 yeah you can say that . ami_da_6
C 835.76 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 839.53 You ca you can go before ami_da_6
D 839.53 , before , yes . ami_da_4
A 841.91 Yeah . ami_da_5
A 843.99 Before ? ami_da_5
A 843.99 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 845.35 And you know here the more iz important aspect is the fancy look and feel , after is technological innovative , and after the easy to use . ami_da_4
A 853.36 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 854.87 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 855.43 I think it is innovative to use the the wheel because I think no one else has . ami_da_4
B 859.64 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 859.91 Yeah that is why ami_da_2
D 859.91 Yeah ami_da_9
D 859.91 that is why I think we have to keep that if it is possible . ami_da_6
A 861.66 Has it ? ami_da_5
A 861.66 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 865.8 I think it is it makes it both easy and both innos innovative . ami_da_4
D 870.73 Innovative . ami_da_16
A 871.28 So I think it is a good aspect and it should be kept . ami_da_9
C 874.18 How do we make it look cool is the question . ami_da_8
A 877.56 Cool , fancy ? ami_da_5
A 877.56 We have to make it ami_da_4
A 877.56 l look like a fruit or vegetable . ami_da_4
C 879.17 Yeah . ami_da_4
D 884.8 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 886.48 Maybe a colour that remember some fruit , things like that . ami_da_6
B 886.6 What about ami_da_3
B 886.6 And for maybe look and feel , what about a a piece of ice , with blue LED inside ? ami_da_6
B 886.6 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 890.58 Oh , colour , yeah . ami_da_9
C 893.32 Well the obvious thing is a banana , I guess . ami_da_4
D 893.87 Oh i ami_da_3
D 893.87 i ami_da_3
D 893.87 I thought about a a pear , for example . ami_da_4
A 897.73 Maybe yeah . ami_da_9
D 899.88 You know the pear , is like that and it is it is easy to to have in in hand ami_da_4
D 899.88 and ami_da_3
D 899.88 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 903.64 Yeah , ami_da_1
A 903.64 and it is ergonomic as well . ami_da_4
A 907.83 A pear . ami_da_11
C 907.98 The banana is also ergonomic . ami_da_4
A 910.13 Yeah . ami_da_6
A 910.56 Maybe pear yeah or something like that . ami_da_6
D 912.65 Or a fruit like that . ami_da_6
D 914.23 I dunno . ami_da_9
A 914.8 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 915.67 We can discuss that . ami_da_6
A 916.56 D D Is is there anything you want to add ? ami_da_5
A 916.56 I do not think so . ami_da_4
C 919.0 Is there any fruit that is spongy ? ami_da_5
C 919.0 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 924.25 I think we we can have like ami_da_6
A 924.25 yeah ami_da_6
A 924.25 a pear is good , fit well , or banana as you told . ami_da_6
A 932.09 Something like that . ami_da_6
A 940.58 But that is not in the trend . ami_da_4
C 940.86 You can make it ami_da_3
C 940.86 It is not hard , the metal . ami_da_4
A 942.29 The trend is spongy , and vegetable fruits . ami_da_4
B 944.01 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 946.55 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 946.88 I think p spongy is good because it it will be robust as well . ami_da_9
C 947.49 Plastic . ami_da_4
B 953.08 Yep . ami_da_1
A 954.35 So , ami_da_2
A 954.35 I think we can keep the wheel ami_da_6
A 954.35 because it is easy , it is innovative , even if the cost is a bit higher , and we also have to find a , so , a fruit like pear or banana ami_da_4
A 954.35 wit any others idea you have . ami_da_8
B 958.45 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 977.12 What kind of fr fruit would you like to to control your TV with ? ami_da_8
A 977.12 Odi ami_da_3
A 977.12 Banana is also yellow so you you ca not lost your remote control then . ami_da_4
B 994.18 Banana I think , ami_da_6
B 994.18 it is a nice idea . ami_da_9
B 997.14 Because But ami_da_3
B 997.14 You y you do not use the banana when the banana is curving like that , but when the banana is curving like that , with the wheel on the top and to control , and here you have a a push button to ami_da_6
B 997.14 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 1001.26 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 1001.83 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 1005.73 Two of the button , ami_da_6
C 1005.73 yeah . ami_da_9
C 1009.52 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 1011.49 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 1013.73 But you do not have ami_da_3
A 1017.24 I think it is a good idea , ami_da_9
A 1017.24 yeah . ami_da_9
C 1017.33 Yeah so you can just have just have this curve , ami_da_6
C 1017.33 yeah , ami_da_13
C 1017.33 and you move your hand here to press the buttons ami_da_4
C 1017.33 and then you move on the other side . ami_da_4
A 1025.0 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 1025.12 So you can have it on on two sides ami_da_4
C 1025.12 and it will be cool , ami_da_9

A 1033.78 Maybe we can keep the banana . ami_da_6
A 1035.15 And it will be very easy to find . ami_da_4
B 1037.32 And everybody knows what is a banana . ami_da_4
B 1039.85 Basically . ami_da_16
B 1040.88 If you if you start with fancy fruits and fra s and tha ami_da_4
B 1040.88 Oh , yeah ami_da_9
B 1040.88 So ami_da_2

B 1040.88 And the chip ami_da_2
B 1040.88 we ami_da_2
B 1040.88 chip imprint we know exactly which one we are going to use . ami_da_4
C 1044.05 Ah ha . ami_da_16
C 1044.79 You can also take into account the fact that the banana fits with the colour scheme of our company . ami_da_4
A 1051.12 Yeah . ami_da_9
C 1052.94 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 1052.98 Yeah it is really really a good point . ami_da_9

C 1067.73 The only th ami_da_3
C 1067.73 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 1070.61 I think it ami_da_3
A 1070.61 So One second . ami_da_2
A 1082.01 So we have to take some decision on this aspect . ami_da_4
A 1085.07 So , so for ami_da_2
A 1085.07 sorry , ami_da_14
A 1085.07 for component , ami_da_4
A 1085.07 so ami_da_2
A 1085.07 we have to think about those aspects , ami_da_4
A 1085.07 sorry . ami_da_14
A 1102.76 Yeah . ami_da_4
B 1110.02 what do you mean by case ? ami_da_5
B 1110.02 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 1112.3 I think it is the box that should be spongy , banana is shape . ami_da_4
B 1116.93 I mean for me if we use a a spongy banana case , does not matter . ami_da_9
B 1122.6 I just want to have so something to prin to to fix my my components onto that box , and that is it . ami_da_4
C 1129.89 Y Yeah that can be in inside th in the structure . ami_da_4
B 1131.67 Yeah yeah . ami_da_1
B 1132.28 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 1132.53 But the thing is that the buttons and the wheel have to be ami_da_4
C 1132.53 I mean if it is spongy then the buttons and the wheel have to ami_da_3
C 1132.53 I mean if it is spongy then it is going to move , ami_da_4
C 1132.53 right ? ami_da_5
C 1132.53 So , it is going to be bend a lot . ami_da_4
B 1137.95 Spongy also . ami_da_4
C 1148.25 So if we try to push the buttons , it ami_da_3
C 1148.25 You think it is possible ? ami_da_11
C 1148.25 Okay . ami_da_9
B 1148.64 Oh no I think it is possible . ami_da_9
A 1148.66 But No the button would be ami_da_3
A 1148.66 In fact it it should be something odd shaped , with a spongy cover . ami_da_6
B 1154.79 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 1156.34 Yeah ami_da_1
B 1157.1 This is like the ami_da_3
C 1157.96 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 1162.26 Okay ami_da_2
A 1162.26 odd shape with spongy cover . ami_da_4
A 1167.98 And standard battery okay , a chip imprint , there is no specific problem . ami_da_4
A 1172.05 So we agree to put the wheel ami_da_4
A 1172.05 So it have to ami_da_4
A 1172.05 it has to be symmetrical . ami_da_4
B 1179.86 Wheel on the top . ami_da_4
B 1181.59 Button , where do we want some buttons ? ami_da_8
B 1181.59 Yeah . ami_da_9
C 1185.01 Well , ami_da_2
C 1185.01 usually hold ami_da_3
C 1185.01 Okay , we want it to be good also for the left hand users , ami_da_4
C 1185.01 right ? ami_da_11
C 1185.01 Yeah ami_da_9
C 1185.01 but ami_da_9
C 1185.01 okay . ami_da_2
C 1196.89 Sa let is say that th o It has to be ami_da_3
C 1196.89 basically you can only take two sides , one on ths this side where is the thumb and the other side where there is yeah also the thumb . ami_da_4
B 1206.44 Yep . ami_da_1
B 1207.64 Yep . ami_da_1
C 1207.99 Basically . ami_da_16
C 1208.97 Or you could use use this one , ami_da_4
C 1208.97 but I do not know if it is very comfortable , to use this one for the wheel . ami_da_9
A 1212.84 Yeah maybe the thumb is more comfortable . ami_da_9
C 1215.09 This for the wheel ami_da_6
C 1215.09 and then this for the buttons ? ami_da_6
C 1215.09 Should have the two sides . ami_da_4
A 1217.03 Yeah I think it is okay for both right and left . ami_da_9
C 1221.17 So if the left , we have the op ami_da_3
C 1221.17 Wheel ami_da_2
C 1221.17 Wheel buttons . ami_da_4
A 1225.27 I think you can turn it this way also . ami_da_4
A 1228.72 You can do both with both hands . ami_da_4
C 1231.6 Yeah , the problem is if you have buttons and wheel then when you turn it around , the buttons are on the other side . ami_da_4
A 1231.94 I think it is okay . ami_da_9
C 1236.47 So you cannot see them . ami_da_4
A 1238.61 Well , you you will get used to it . ami_da_9
C 1239.57 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 1241.78 And moreover , th the button ar are lighted so you you immediately identify the right side , because you have light on buttons . ami_da_4
C 1242.05 So the buttons have to be here and the wheel has to be ami_da_4
C 1242.05 Y ami_da_3
C 1242.05 Yeah I know , ami_da_9
C 1242.05 but if you hold with your left hand , and the wheel is here , and the buttons are here , then when you turn it around the buttons will be on the other side . ami_da_4
A 1256.6 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 1260.59 No ami_da_9
A 1260.59 you you ami_da_2
A 1260.59 I think you will use it only on the right or left hand , whether you are righty or lefty . ami_da_4
A 1268.91 I think for lefty it is okay . ami_da_9
A 1270.85 I can do this movement , ami_da_4
A 1270.85 and for righty as well . ami_da_9
A 1275.86 I think this does not change that much . ami_da_4
C 1279.52 Okay . ami_da_9
A 1281.06 Yeah ? ami_da_11
A 1281.06 So , ami_da_2
A 1281.06 for interface we said also that we have this banana shape with button on the s on the side . ami_da_4
C 1282.58 Okay . ami_da_9
C 1283.24 Maybe . ami_da_9
C 1285.22 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 1298.28 And ami_da_2
A 1298.28 and a wheel on the top . ami_da_4
C 1303.91 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 1311.97 So the colour is yellow . ami_da_4
A 1315.46 I think it is ami_da_3
A 1315.46 we defined everything according to what we should what the decision we should take , yeah . ami_da_4
A 1326.04 So maybe we can ami_da_2
A 1326.04 we can work on those aspects until next meeting . ami_da_6
A 1337.08 So have the final look and feel design according to the decision . ami_da_6
A 1343.27 And have the the user interface design and then evaluate the prodyuc the product . ami_da_6
A 1351.34 That is to say , check if it fit the the requirement given by the users , ami_da_4
A 1351.34 but according to your presentation it seems to be okay . ami_da_9
A 1364.25 It seems to be fancy , innovative , and easy to use . ami_da_9
A 1370.84 So so ami_da_2
A 1370.84 to prepare the prototype I would suggest that the Industrial Designer and the User Interface Designer work together . ami_da_6
A 1382.74 That would be better , I think . ami_da_9
B 1385.3 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 1388.47 And And so ami_da_2
A 1388.47 you will receive further instruction by emails , as usual . ami_da_4
A 1397.82 So ami_da_2
A 1397.82 do you need to add anything ? ami_da_8
A 1397.82 You feel okay ? ami_da_14
A 1397.82 You feel free to express what you want to say ? ami_da_14
A 1397.82 You do not feel too constrained ? ami_da_14
A 1397.82 You do not feel free to answer this ? ami_da_14
A 1397.82 Okay , so ami_da_2
C 1397.86 Yes master . ami_da_15
C 1403.3 No . ami_da_4
C 1405.96 Yeah . ami_da_4
C 1409.75 Yeah . ami_da_4
