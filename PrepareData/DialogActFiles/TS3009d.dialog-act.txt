A 142.2 It is also copy paste from what we made together . ami_da_4
A 144.64 So we still know that . ami_da_4
D 145.28 Okay . ami_da_1
A 147.17 And then we can we can use the time better . ami_da_6
A 150.26 Well next you two will present the pot prototype for us . ami_da_4

C 154.85 Alright . ami_da_9
A 156.39 Yeah . ami_da_9
B 157.6 Alright . ami_da_9
B 160.22 No you go ami_da_6
B 160.22 and I will supplement you . ami_da_7
C 162.26 If I make mistakes ami_da_4
C 162.26 you will ami_da_4
C 162.26 Right . ami_da_2
B 164.84 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 166.2 Correct . ami_da_9
C 166.65 well ami_da_2
C 166.65 this is our design . ami_da_4
C 168.44 it is pretty much like Mike draw drew the in the during the last meeting . ami_da_4
C 176.44 With the different perspectives of it . ami_da_4
C 178.73 we will begin with the front . ami_da_4
C 181.34 We have of course the the round shape the round basic shape . ami_da_4
C 186.3 with the upper part being the front . ami_da_4
C 189.52 Th ami_da_4
C 189.52 So there is this part which is made of hard plastic , the front . ami_da_4
C 194.58 And we are we are using different colours . ami_da_4
C 196.93 Of course for the launch we use the basic ugly colours , and later we will put out more interesting covers with different patterns and pictures and everything . ami_da_4
A 200.1 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 205.09 But basically , different colours , bright colours not black , too dark . ami_da_4
C 209.39 Fancy colours . ami_da_4
C 211.19 then we have the lower part of the of the device . ami_da_4
C 217.58 which is of course part of the back actually , because it is also titanium . ami_da_4
C 222.51 You can see it also on the on the on the side view , that only this part is the front , and the rest of it , the under the under side of it , yeah , the back side and the lower part of the front is of course titanium made of titanium , and has the titanium colour of course , the look . ami_da_4
C 241.37 then we have on back on the front the logo in the upper corner , which is made which is also part of the back , part of the titanium titanium part . ami_da_4
B 252.83 Yeah , it is a double R , but It is a double R . ami_da_4
C 254.91 Yeah ? ami_da_12
C 254.91 It is a double R . ami_da_9
C 258.01 Yeah the logo it is difficult to draw so small , ami_da_9
C 258.01 but it is our double R logo is in there . ami_da_4
B 258.19 But it is very difficult to to draw that in ami_da_9
B 258.19 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 258.92 Yeah , alright . ami_da_1
A 262.67 Okay . ami_da_1
A 264.12 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 264.58 so that is the logo in the upper lef right corner . ami_da_4
C 268.56 Then we have the buttons . ami_da_4
C 269.48 it is difficult to draw again the little oval or round ami_da_9
C 269.48 I think oval will be better for the for the d for the different channel buttons . ami_da_6
B 275.39 Oval ami_da_9
B 275.39 yeah . ami_da_9
A 278.13 Alright . ami_da_1
C 281.4 So oval , n those are here . ami_da_4
C 283.4 And then we have the m The m ami_da_3
C 283.4 Yeah ami_da_9
C 283.4 the the con the the the , yeah , the t volume and the channel controls in the middle here . ami_da_4
B 286.89 Channel up and volume ? ami_da_6
B 286.89 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 293.89 with kind of arrow shapes , ami_da_4
C 293.89 which makes it also a bit more exciting than basic round or square buttons . ami_da_9
C 307.27 And also here are the two buttons we agreed on . ami_da_4
C 310.25 We have the Okay button . ami_da_4
C 311.35 Oh nei ami_da_9
C 311.35 we the Okay button is here in the middle of the of the operators , of the channel and volume changers . ami_da_4
C 319.19 And then we have here the Menu button ami_da_4
C 319.19 and the ami_da_3
C 319.19 And the video button . ami_da_4
A 321.54 Alright . ami_da_1
B 322.01 Menu for the LCD screen . ami_da_4
C 323.81 The ami_da_3
C 323.81 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 324.06 right . ami_da_1
A 324.48 So Okay . ami_da_1
C 326.04 And of course this low part , this is the LCD screen . ami_da_4
C 330.02 this is what we made of it . ami_da_4
C 331.31 You can make suggestions if you want . ami_da_8
A 332.7 Well if I look at it , the side the side view ami_da_6
A 332.7 Oh yeah alright . ami_da_9
B 333.3 Well , at the back ami_da_3
B 333.3 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 335.56 Maybe we maybe we should finish first our talk and then you can add suggestions . ami_da_6
C 338.71 Maybe I ami_da_4
C 338.71 I do not want to ami_da_4
C 338.71 I do not want to suppress you ami_da_4
C 338.71 but n I will finish this quick . ami_da_4
A 339.59 Yeah . ami_da_9
C 344.93 okay I have had everything I guess on the front ? ami_da_4
C 344.93 Yeah the back . ami_da_9
B 347.96 No the back . ami_da_4
B 348.7 With the logo and our l ami_da_4
B 348.7 No I do not think ami_da_9
B 348.7 And the ami_da_3
B 348.7 And about the side view This the front wo not be as thick , but again th the the drawing technique makes it very difficult to to really ami_da_4
B 348.7 Well , it wo not be visible . ami_da_4
C 349.35 Yeah . ami_da_9
C 351.45 We thought about ami_da_3
C 351.45 Yeah , the back is of course totally titanium . ami_da_4
C 355.35 And we thought about the logo big in the middle . ami_da_4
C 358.64 Just so again the double R . ami_da_4
C 360.08 We have then the logo on front and on the back . ami_da_4
C 362.57 Maybe that is too much ami_da_9
C 362.57 but you have to say say that if you think that way . ami_da_11
A 363.39 Okay . ami_da_1
C 367.51 And the company slogan , we thought in a kind of arc shape above the logo . ami_da_4
A 371.78 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 372.52 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 374.96 That is basically what we were thinking about , ami_da_4
C 374.96 and ami_da_3
C 374.96 Oh and before I forget . ami_da_4
A 378.02 Okay . ami_da_1
A 379.2 W ami_da_3
A 379.2 Well I see , but ami_da_12
A 379.2 Well . ami_da_12
C 391.04 Yeah the the voice , of course , the voice recorder is at the bottom . ami_da_4
A 391.98 Yeah I see it . ami_da_12
A 395.2 Yes . ami_da_1
C 395.32 And you can record it using , yeah , the the the back of the f w device . ami_da_4
A 398.04 When I look at when I look at this side view , I think w when I have that in my hand ami_da_9
A 398.04 , it is terrible . ami_da_9
B 401.19 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 405.93 If if you look if if this this is thick , and this is thin , th th then it that it lies over your hands . ami_da_4
C 406.04 Why ? ami_da_5
C 406.04 Well it fits it it ami_da_4
C 406.04 it ami_da_4
C 406.04 it fits the hand , ami_da_4
C 406.04 mean the the the the ami_da_3
C 406.04 In the middle in the ami_da_4
C 406.04 That is the question . ami_da_4
A 411.54 But Well what what what ami_da_4
A 411.54 I what I agree is that when when you have such of an arc in the middle , so that the the a the ends and the fronts is a bit thicker , so th then it falls over your hands . ami_da_4
D 414.19 Yeah , I agree . ami_da_9
B 426.96 If y ami_da_3
B 426.96 If you handle a remote , you you usually do not have your hand straight like this . ami_da_4
B 433.11 You you have it a bit ami_da_4
B 433.11 Yeah . ami_da_4
D 434.05 It depends on the size . ami_da_4
D 436.1 If it is kind of small , this is is great . ami_da_4
D 438.77 But if it is it is larger , then you want to grab it . ami_da_4
A 441.78 And how large is it ? ami_da_5
A 441.78 Well ami_da_3
A 441.78 Well the sides I have not seen yet , ? ami_da_4
A 441.78 They the the the the the side view , ami_da_4
A 441.78 we did not ami_da_3
A 441.78 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 442.0 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 442.98 Yeah , that is the question . ami_da_9
C 446.24 well Yeah . ami_da_2
C 448.39 H ami_da_8
C 448.39 What do you suggest ami_da_8
C 448.39 I mean we do ? ami_da_8
C 448.39 This was Mike is prototype , and ami_da_4
C 448.39 y you seemed to agreed on it . ami_da_4
C 453.83 But now you have a totally different . ami_da_4
B 456.89 Well , they lay there all the time . ami_da_4
C 457.68 The size ? ami_da_11
C 457.68 Yeah well the size does not really matter ami_da_4
C 457.68 w ami_da_4
C 457.68 I mean ami_da_4
C 457.68 Side ? ami_da_12
C 457.68 oh the side ? ami_da_12
C 457.68 W ami_da_4
C 457.68 we we ami_da_4
C 457.68 he drew the s the side , but you d you were not paying attention as usual . ami_da_4
B 463.51 Yeah yeah . ami_da_1
C 467.14 Well any case , we will discuss it now . ami_da_4
C 469.4 I think this is a pretty good good idea . ami_da_9
D 472.25 Yeah , I agree with the LCD screen . ami_da_9
D 474.5 You have it in your palm like this , and you can watch watch the screen . ami_da_4
D 480.22 And if you have it li in the middle , your hand might be over it . ami_da_6
C 484.73 But you you hold it like this . ami_da_4
B 486.4 Yeah ami_da_9
B 486.4 you you do not you do not grab it , ami_da_4
B 486.4 you you ami_da_3
B 486.4 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 486.86 You are not holding it like this or something . ami_da_4
C 489.76 You , yeah , ami_da_16
C 489.76 y ami_da_16
C 489.76 How do you call it ? ami_da_16
C 489.76 Yeah . ami_da_16
C 491.81 Well y y y ami_da_4
C 491.81 you do not have it like this . ami_da_4
C 494.92 You have it more like this . ami_da_4
A 495.23 No no no . ami_da_1
C 497.09 You you you are using buttons this way , or if you are right handed , this way . ami_da_4
D 499.43 Like you are holding your telephone . ami_da_4
A 500.37 Yep . ami_da_1
C 501.91 So you ami_da_3
C 501.91 Yeah . ami_da_3
D 502.46 Because if you have a screen on it , you want to look at your screen . ami_da_4
C 502.68 So ami_da_3
C 502.68 Yeah well ami_da_2
C 502.68 And maybe you can you can grab it a bit higher , ami_da_6
C 502.68 so Well ami_da_3
C 502.68 Well the the Well that is a reason to to to put the LCD screen of course on the upper side , but If necessary . ami_da_4
B 506.85 That way , it it falls into your hand . ami_da_4
B 508.42 I think . ami_da_4
A 509.84 Okay . ami_da_12
D 510.77 Yeah , I agree on this . ami_da_9
D 514.04 No , I do not think so . ami_da_9
D 515.47 That is not the point ami_da_4
D 515.47 And you might be You might be target customer . ami_da_6
B 516.17 No ami_da_1
B 516.17 but but ami_da_1
B 516.17 Well f for as far as I can see , three of us agree and only Nils ami_da_4
B 516.17 But you are the Project Manager , you can make the hard decisions . ami_da_4
A 527.27 Yeah well ami_da_2
A 527.27 I think if you t if you three agree then then that is it . ami_da_4
A 534.25 Yes . ami_da_9
A 534.82 So I c ami_da_3
A 534.82 I c ami_da_3
A 534.82 Well , we will we we will do it like this . ami_da_4
C 535.57 But are d Can you live with it ? ami_da_5
C 535.57 Y Yeah , ami_da_3
C 535.57 y y ami_da_4
C 535.57 y ami_da_4
C 535.57 y ami_da_4
C 535.57 you said it was totally unusable . ami_da_4
B 538.04 Yeah ? ami_da_12
A 538.41 Alright , if you think that that is the way ami_da_4
A 538.41 it should ami_da_4
A 538.41 No No , ami_da_9
A 538.41 when I I my personal taste is that I want it to fall over my hands with a thick ami_da_4
A 538.41 But In the market ami_da_3
A 538.41 No not totally . ami_da_9
C 543.27 But do you ami_da_3
C 543.27 But d you do not think this is completely unusable I guess . ami_da_4
C 553.12 I think . ami_da_4
C 555.05 Not totally , well ami_da_9
C 555.05 Yeah ami_da_9
C 555.05 but of course ami_da_9
C 555.05 y you are also human . ami_da_4
A 555.64 For me , I I would not buy it . ami_da_4
A 557.57 Let is say it like that . ami_da_4
C 559.65 We have to take every everyone into account . ami_da_4
A 560.33 No ami_da_3
A 560.33 Yes ami_da_3
A 560.33 but ami_da_3
A 560.33 Yeah , we do not know , ami_da_9
A 560.33 but that is that is that is that is more market research . ami_da_6
C 565.12 So ami_da_4
C 565.12 Yeah . ami_da_9
C 567.38 Well who who else thinks like you ? ami_da_6
C 567.38 We do not know . ami_da_4
C 569.48 Maybe a thousand people , or a million people . ami_da_6
A 573.13 So let it be like this at at this moment . ami_da_6
C 575.19 Let it be . ami_da_14
C 576.26 Alright . ami_da_2
A 576.74 Okay ? ami_da_13
A 576.74 No , I think it is great . ami_da_9
C 577.41 So that is that . ami_da_4
C 578.07 any other suggestions ? ami_da_8
C 578.07 You are very personal again . ami_da_9
D 581.59 Yeah . ami_da_9
B 582.34 But what about the redesigning ? ami_da_5
B 582.34 Okay . ami_da_1
A 585.57 Comes to that later . ami_da_4
A 587.01 you . ami_da_4
A 588.07 c You can Walter . ami_da_4
A 591.7 You can do the evaluation criteria on this ? ami_da_4
A 591.7 That is more useful than just speaking . ami_da_9
D 594.18 Alright . ami_da_9
D 594.61 Great . ami_da_9
D 607.69 Well , this is just a short intro . ami_da_4
D 609.79 I am going to do the ev evaluation . ami_da_4
A 609.8 Yes . ami_da_1
D 613.14 That is going to be done at the end of seven point skill criteria . ami_da_4
D 619.03 So I made a I made a few questions on the hand of the impor most important requirements and trends . ami_da_4
D 626.15 And we have to look if our if our device is working correctly . ami_da_4
D 632.6 Well , I put some questions in a Word file . ami_da_4
D 636.15 See if I can find them . ami_da_7
A 644.52 Okay . ami_da_2
D 644.52 Well ami_da_2
D 644.52 I think you have all seen this kind of evaluation , so I do not have to explain it . ami_da_4
D 651.06 the first question is , is the device good looking ? ami_da_4
D 651.06 Because normal p most people thought that earlier devices were ugly ugly . ami_da_4
D 662.45 Seventy five percent of them . ami_da_4
D 663.88 So what do we think ? ami_da_11
D 663.88 Yeah ami_da_1
D 663.88 No , I know , ami_da_9
D 663.88 but I have to evaluate it . ami_da_4
C 667.1 Well d we designed it , ami_da_4
C 667.1 so of course we are very ami_da_9
C 667.1 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 670.07 Yeah , we are we are not quite objective about this . ami_da_4
B 672.24 Well we designed it to be good looking . ami_da_4
D 675.92 So I have to take this questionnaire . ami_da_4
C 680.04 So and we ha we have answer now ? ami_da_5
C 680.04 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 680.34 To the customers ? ami_da_6
A 680.34 To potential customers who have to take this questionnaire ? ami_da_6
A 680.34 Nei . ami_da_12
D 681.91 Yeah ami_da_4
D 681.91 Yeah , ami_da_4
D 681.91 but I ca not can s ami_da_4
D 681.91 Yeah , ami_da_4
D 681.91 but , you know We dis we di ami_da_4
D 681.91 we designed it to be perfect . ami_da_4
A 685.35 Oh no . ami_da_12
A 685.83 I know , I know , I know . ami_da_12
A 687.19 But Well we can go , because of the time , pretty quick through this . ami_da_4
A 692.09 do we find it good looking ? ami_da_11
A 692.09 Well we think so . ami_da_9
C 695.19 I ami_da_3
C 695.19 Yeah , I think it ami_da_3
C 695.19 Well l well let is start with the beginning , just one by one . ami_da_6
A 695.23 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 695.25 Yeah . ami_da_4
B 695.77 We designed it to be good looking , so ami_da_4
D 700.92 So But we have to be critic critical about it . ami_da_4
D 705.29 And I have to take all these points and get a average at the end . ami_da_4
D 708.65 So we we know where we stand . ami_da_4
A 709.67 Well , one . ami_da_9
D 711.62 Because th there are some things we might have bi might have forgotten . ami_da_4
A 715.41 Well so it is point four . ami_da_4
D 717.44 Right , so Right . ami_da_9
A 717.92 Easy to find t ami_da_4
A 717.92 Two . ami_da_6
D 720.75 is it good looking ? ami_da_5
D 720.75 The titanium might be f for older people . ami_da_6
C 722.2 Well , I guess I think it is ami_da_4
C 722.2 it is it is pointed towards the youth of course , if you look at the design and and the colours and everything . ami_da_4
C 732.82 That was our target audience of course . ami_da_4
C 734.26 But it is also not completely u unacceptable for older people I guess . ami_da_4
C 740.19 it is it is not f a device that ami_da_3
C 740.19 Yeah , that is that is for older people , ami_da_9

C 751.82 they think the the titanium look of it is also ami_da_4
C 751.82 I think it is also good for them , ami_da_4
C 751.82 so I think we both have consider considered the youth and also a bit older people . ami_da_4
C 767.34 So I think it is very good looking and not only for youth young people . ami_da_9
D 768.03 Right . ami_da_1

B 822.1 Well it is easier to find than a a normal black one or something , because of the colour . ami_da_4

A 1053.74 One . ami_da_4
C 1055.05 Single ami_da_16
C 1055.05 Well you have to use a chip . ami_da_4
C 1059.73 So Well you have to use the advanced chip , if you have the LCD screen . ami_da_4
B 1063.07 We we we ami_da_3
B 1063.07 Why ? ami_da_5
B 1063.07 We have very little options furthermore , ami_da_4
B 1063.07 for the ami_da_3
B 1063.07 well we have to put that in . ami_da_4
C 1068.35 But if you have a regular chip , you ca not have the LCD screen . ami_da_4

D 1077.13 Yeah , ami_da_9
D 1077.13 but No , that is ami_da_9

C 1084.04 it ami_da_3
C 1084.04 d it does not ami_da_3
C 1084.04 But we d Then we have to lose the LCD screen . ami_da_4
A 1085.64 Yeah , ami_da_9
A 1085.64 then you s then you only have one half left . ami_da_4
B 1085.84 Yeah , you must change the chip back . ami_da_4
B 1088.56 You must change the chip back , Nils . ami_da_4
D 1088.58 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 1090.94 yeah . ami_da_9
D 1094.93 No , Then the whole concept is ami_da_9

D 1094.93 You can make you can make it cheaper . ami_da_6
C 1098.44 Yeah , I know ami_da_9
C 1098.44 but that is what my information says . ami_da_4

D 1107.6 No ami_da_1
D 1107.6 no no no . ami_da_9
A 1110.5 Yeah . ami_da_1

A 1115.07 Yeah ? ami_da_5
A 1115.07 No , ami_da_9
A 1115.07 the advanced chip is needed to have an LCD display . ami_da_4
B 1116.24 Y we do not need both . ami_da_4
C 1119.31 For the LCD screen . ami_da_4
C 1120.36 Yeah . ami_da_4
C 1121.13 Yeah . ami_da_4
B 1121.54 Says . ami_da_5
A 1122.59 Says , his that was in the second meeting , I think . ami_da_4
C 1125.09 Well and what do they mean with curves again ? ami_da_5
C 1125.09 Because we you have uncurved ami_da_4
C 1125.09 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 1128.85 Well I I did single curve to ami_da_4
A 1128.85 Well you said s double curved , ami_da_4
A 1128.85 he , ami_da_9
A 1128.85 because I thought it is a b a bit cheaper already . ami_da_4
B 1132.14 I ? ami_da_9
B 1132.14 One curve . ami_da_4
A 1136.96 We can also make it flat . ami_da_6
C 1137.36 Well But what what did what do ami_da_3
C 1137.36 n ami_da_3
C 1137.36 Sorry , ami_da_14
C 1137.36 but What do they mean with the curves ? ami_da_5
C 1137.36 Is th Is this a curve ? ami_da_5
C 1137.36 One curve ? ami_da_11
C 1137.36 Yeah , this is actually two curves , yeah . ami_da_4
A 1139.17 But ami_da_3
A 1139.17 Curved ? ami_da_12
A 1139.17 Yes , that is curved . ami_da_4
A 1145.03 Yes . ami_da_9
C 1146.21 It is how you It is how you look at it . ami_da_4
A 1146.44 No , it is one curve . ami_da_9
A 1148.46 One curve , simple . ami_da_4
C 1150.05 Well then we have a huge problem I think . ami_da_9
C 1151.49 W t we can never get below the twelve and a half . ami_da_4
A 1153.58 We have a big financial problem . ami_da_4
B 1155.78 Well we make it more expensive to buy . ami_da_6
A 1158.6 Well , then we have two dollars less profit . ami_da_4
A 1161.94 Come on , ami_da_9
A 1161.94 if we if we if we make this fifty million , they wo not hesitate to congratulate us , so By the way , we also have this one . ami_da_4
D 1169.05 If if you make people brand aware , they are willing to pay more . ami_da_4
D 1173.11 But Because we we use a brand at the front and I dun at the back . ami_da_4
C 1174.18 But I ami_da_3
C 1174.18 Hey but I think you will agree that that we that now we have this screen , it is it is very not practical to ha to consider this after we have designed the entire thing . ami_da_4
D 1179.39 If you have lots of marketing people might buy . ami_da_4
B 1185.53 Yeah or we could replace it ami_da_3
B 1185.53 Why why do not we replace the titanium with plastic coloured titanium , titanium coloured plastic ? ami_da_6
B 1185.53 Yeah well if we we we have to get cheaper . ami_da_4
D 1186.7 If you if you make it cool to have ami_da_3
D 1186.7 Oh , that is just great . ami_da_9
A 1194.73 Oh , costs nothing . ami_da_4
D 1196.17 Oh , alright . ami_da_1
A 1196.49 That is nice . ami_da_9
A 1199.22 Plastic is ami_da_3
A 1199.22 Yes , ami_da_9
A 1199.22 but I just got it . ami_da_4
C 1212.6 Well that is pretty l ami_da_3
C 1212.6 N not very practical . ami_da_9
D 1214.93 That is pretty stupid . ami_da_9
C 1218.23 Well But I am ami_da_9
C 1218.23 n I do not agree . ami_da_9
A 1221.82 Who ? ami_da_12
A 1221.82 You want to dump the titanium ? ami_da_5
A 1221.82 And make all plastic , then we ha then we are there . ami_da_4
B 1239.31 But then we we have got to run through the eval evaluation process again . ami_da_4
C 1239.35 I think ami_da_3
C 1239.35 I think the titanium just provided the the tough look and the and the And also the the older people will like it because of that . ami_da_4
A 1240.76 Th then you have a ugly , stupid , l ugly looking , dumb remote that that no one would buy . ami_da_9
B 1247.46 no no . ami_da_9
B 1249.37 It is not ugly looking . ami_da_4
B 1250.37 The looks remain the same . ami_da_4
A 1251.65 No , I do not think so . ami_da_9
D 1252.68 Y ami_da_3
D 1252.68 Yeah , I agree . ami_da_9
B 1252.76 Well , I do think so . ami_da_9
A 1256.32 Yes . ami_da_9
A 1257.18 And the feel , and th that it is strong , and ami_da_4
A 1257.18 We still ami_da_3
A 1257.18 we had to focus to get more people from the younger group , but not lose the one ami_da_4
A 1257.18 Why ca not I ami_da_3
A 1257.18 I will put in the report we that we think that fourteen point one is the l m lowest price you can make a remote for that is trendy d these days . ami_da_7
B 1257.75 feel . ami_da_3
C 1262.06 And because i ami_da_3
C 1262.06 Alright it is not our target audience , but it is it is useful if it is important for old people . ami_da_4
C 1268.89 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 1271.97 I think the titanium is very important . ami_da_9
B 1273.88 Yeah alright ami_da_12
B 1273.88 but then we we wo not get there . ami_da_4
C 1275.25 Yeah we have a problem , yeah . ami_da_9
C 1276.41 W ami_da_6
C 1276.41 But you can better , yeah , dump the LCD screen then . ami_da_6

A 1542.03 Well it is both a SMARTboard . ami_da_4
C 1542.82 That is that is the smart ami_da_4
C 1542.82 A televi ami_da_9

D 1547.65 This is just a beamer function . ami_da_4
A 1549.1 It is both a SMARTboard , but this one is used for a desktop , and that one is used to to draw . ami_da_4

D 1602.43 I agree . ami_da_9
D 1606.98 No . ami_da_9
C 1607.18 I ami_da_4

C 1608.26 I wrote things down ami_da_4
C 1608.26 but I did not import it into my laptop . ami_da_4
D 1612.82 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 1613.93 That is the ami_da_3
C 1613.93 W ami_da_4
C 1613.93 But also y you write things down . ami_da_4
D 1615.11 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 1615.7 It is not practical . ami_da_4
D 1617.43 Right . ami_da_4

A 1626.63 It is , no , it it is useless . ami_da_9
B 1628.35 Well I I drew this . ami_da_4
B 1632.16 And I made a mistake . ami_da_4
B 1633.01 But it it would have been useful , if I I could show this on the screen . ami_da_4
A 1635.28 Yes . ami_da_1
A 1637.48 For drawings , yes . ami_da_9
C 1637.5 For drawings , ami_da_9
C 1637.5 but not for personal notes . ami_da_4
B 1638.42 Yeah for drawings . ami_da_9

C 1639.69 I mean you can bring your paperwork along and p ami_da_4
C 1639.69 Well of course if you have a lot of paper ami_da_4
C 1639.69 If you have If you have ami_da_3
C 1639.69 Yeah I understand . ami_da_9

A 1647.04 But ami_da_3
A 1647.04 But for notes , it i you you have to put that in a strict you have to put a name , standard date , and all those things . ami_da_4
D 1647.11 Yeah , it might be useful for drawings . ami_da_9
D 1648.9 I I agree on that . ami_da_9
A 1657.31 And notes for a meeting are very strict . ami_da_4
