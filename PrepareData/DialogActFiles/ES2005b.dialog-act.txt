C 2.55 minutes from the last meeting which were essentially that we had decided on roles for each of you , however , there are some changes that I have got from on high ami_da_4
C 2.55 that are a bit ami_da_2
C 2.55 well w what I did not actually realise it was that the this is for a specific television . ami_da_4
D 17.03 Okay . ami_da_1
D 28.17 Okay . ami_da_9
C 29.1 So the all in one idea goes out the window . ami_da_4
C 31.33 And they require that the ami_da_3
C 31.33 actually I will get to that at the end point number four , ami_da_7
C 31.33 we will get what you have got and then we can see what we can adapt from it . ami_da_6
C 45.31 So , presentations , ami_da_4
C 45.31 were you anybody got , raring to go ? ami_da_8
C 45.31 Raring to go ? ami_da_8
C 45.31 Okay . ami_da_9
B 50.86 Yeah . ami_da_7
B 51.99 Yeah . ami_da_7
C 53.88 Good stuff . ami_da_9
C 63.47 Oh I need to plug you in . ami_da_7
B 63.56 So how ami_da_5

B 63.56 Sh do you want me to hold it ? ami_da_5
B 63.56 So , after that ? ami_da_5
B 63.56 F eight . ami_da_12
D 76.47 Wow . ami_da_16
C 76.68 Just about . ami_da_9
A 78.16 It is a inspired design . ami_da_14
C 86.78 there we go , ami_da_16
C 86.78 just screw them on in . ami_da_4
C 89.19 Gonna have to swap them round so now , it was function F eight . ami_da_4
C 100.97 That is the wee blue one . ami_da_4
B 101.29 f oh sorry F eight . ami_da_16
C 103.83 Blue one F eight . ami_da_4
C 106.71 Should do it , good one . ami_da_9
B 106.74 Okay . ami_da_9
B 110.31 Yeah . ami_da_9
B 117.75 Yeah . ami_da_2
B 119.08 , me again , Rajan the Marketing Expert . ami_da_4
B 123.28 , as we have decided in the last meeting that I have to find out , ami_da_3
B 123.28 sorry , ami_da_7
B 123.28 yeah sure . ami_da_7
C 127.14 Hold on , sorry . ami_da_6
C 130.12 and if you just click that it will go ahead , one at a time . ami_da_4
B 132.1 Yeah , ami_da_9
B 132.1 yeah . ami_da_9
B 133.41 actually , sorry I have to see the other , sorry . ami_da_4
C 137.83 Sorry , . ami_da_14
B 139.96 Yeah , thank you . ami_da_14
B 141.72 , yes , I have to look at the market potential for this product , , like consumer likings and everything , what is the potential for this product and are we able to achieve our a net profit or our aims or not ? ami_da_4
B 141.72 Then ami_da_2
B 141.72 Sorry . ami_da_14
C 161.18 P press F five to start it first . ami_da_4
B 164.98 Okay . ami_da_9
B 165.62 Yeah , I can , okay . ami_da_9
C 169.17 Jesus . ami_da_16
B 169.56 then the methodology I adopted to find out all this was market survey . ami_da_4
B 178.0 A a detailed market survey on consumers was done to find out their likings and dislikings , what they prefer what they not prefer , w what problems they do encounter in all this type of things . ami_da_4
B 189.39 And what we got was , we found that if you , what they th what problems they are having with different remote controls available in the market . ami_da_4
B 202.08 Seventy five percent of users they do find it that the remote controls available in the market are ugly . ami_da_4
B 207.49 They are not so good looking . ami_da_4
B 208.95 So , we have to put stress on this , we have to take care of this fact also like our design , should be appropriate , should be good looking for the consumers . ami_da_6
B 219.52 And yes that is wi this ami_da_4
B 219.52 will definitely , this can definitely put enhance our sales . ami_da_4
B 228.16 and even the good thing about this is that eighty percent of users they are willing to pay high pay more for this good looking remote controls also . ami_da_4
B 239.0 So even if the available market goes for the available ami_da_2
B 239.0 even if the market goes for the available remote control is less even then we can sell it at twenty five Euros , ami_da_4
B 239.0 which maybe which may seem quite high but if our looks are are if the re remote control we design have a good better better look designs , then we can hope that consumers will prefer these g remote controls . ami_da_9
C 263.73 Excellent . ami_da_9
B 264.53 Then ami_da_2
B 264.53 And the second thing , some some companies they think that they should have more and more functions of the users or in their remote controls , ami_da_4
B 264.53 but rather than those having more functions in the remote controls we should emphasise what actually consumer want , what they operate , rather than making it too complicated . ami_da_6
B 290.87 Because mostly it has been found that fifty percent of the users they use only ten percent of the buttons , ami_da_4
B 290.87 so there is no point of having ninety percent buttons making the remote controls too bulky , too complicated too expensive a because I think I believe that technology is useful only if the consumers they want to use it . ami_da_9
B 310.9 Otherwise there is no point of having all this type of things . ami_da_9
B 313.84 So this will not only reduce the cost of our remote controls but it will increase our profit also . ami_da_4
B 321.29 So we have to take care of this fact also . ami_da_6
B 324.55 Then . ami_da_2
B 326.39 it was function I want to go to . ami_da_4
C 328.36 Oh you want to go back ? ami_da_4
C 328.36 Just escape . ami_da_4
B 330.39 , escape , okay ami_da_9
B 330.39 thank you . ami_da_14
B 333.37 Then if we look at this slide , ami_da_6
B 333.37 these are in your shared documents , you can see , ami_da_4
B 333.37 like ami_da_2
B 333.37 , sorry . ami_da_14
C 336.94 Okay . ami_da_1
C 340.45 Okay . ami_da_1
D 342.87 So , sorry ami_da_14
D 342.87 I was just going to say , ami_da_7
D 342.87 what was the question for this ? ami_da_5
D 342.87 Or is are you coming on to that ? ami_da_5
D 342.87 Okay . ami_da_1
B 348.84 t look all the market potential , what how we should design consu our remote controls , what they should be there so as to en enhance our profit , enhance our sales . ami_da_4
D 358.47 So these percentages are are what ? ami_da_5
B 360.28 Yeah , these are different age group persons ami_da_4
B 360.28 like ami_da_2
B 360.28 sorry , ami_da_14
B 360.28 I can open it in another way . ami_da_7
C 369.05 Okay . ami_da_4
B 369.74 , yes . ami_da_9
C 370.03 Speech recognition . ami_da_4
B 371.74 If we look at the costs whether the consumers they are willing to pay more for speech recognition in a remote control or not , we can find that they up to a thirty five years age group we have a very good disliking for this this point , like for speech recognition in a remote control . ami_da_4
B 391.48 So we can emphasise on this point also like , ami_da_6
B 391.48 because it will definitely enhance our sales in this ag in this particular age group from fifteen to thirty five , and I and I think that most of the users of the rem TV are belong to this age group . ami_da_4
B 408.44 So we should look ami_da_3
B 408.44 Yeah . ami_da_9
C 409.34 We are als we we are looking at who buys it as well . ami_da_6
B 412.63 We can look at that that factor also , so yes . ami_da_9
C 416.27 , which I think the twenty five to thirty five is usual , sort of . ami_da_4
B 420.77 Yeah . ami_da_9
B 421.67 So , and And then ami_da_2
B 421.67 Yes . ami_da_9
C 428.8 Fifteen to twe ami_da_16
C 428.8 Okay . ami_da_1
B 434.61 I think so . ami_da_9
B 435.82 if we look at this data how how h how what are the problems the consumers are facing with the existing remote controls in the market . ami_da_4
B 445.66 They find that thirt thirty five percent thirty four percent of the consumers they find too difficult to operate a remote control . ami_da_4
B 452.65 So it should be in such a way that it should be easy to learn how to operate these remote controls and we should provide pl spe proper manuals for its use also so as that people consumers could easily learn . ami_da_6
B 466.56 They need not to have any , much technical knowledge to see to know how to operate these remote controls . ami_da_4
B 472.7 So this is also a very goo major factor to loo take into consideration to enhance our profits and sales . ami_da_6
B 480.28 So this is all about market potential by me . ami_da_4
B 486.33 , yes , ami_da_2
B 486.33 th thank you . ami_da_14
C 487.7 Okay , thank you . ami_da_14
C 489.34 , follow on with Helen ? ami_da_8
C 489.34 Yeah please . ami_da_14
D 492.36 Yep , sure , that is cool , ami_da_7
D 492.36 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 494.81 Yeah we have to take that out . ami_da_4

B 511.17 Thank you very much Brian . ami_da_14
B 514.33 If you want me to help , yeah . ami_da_7
D 515.51 , yep . ami_da_9
B 523.87 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 524.36 Okay , and then what do I press , F eight ? ami_da_5
D 524.36 Oh right . ami_da_9
B 525.73 F eight . ami_da_4
C 526.59 Function F eight . ami_da_4
B 526.69 Function F eight . ami_da_4
B 531.23 s . ami_da_3
D 532.26 Okay , cool . ami_da_9
B 533.17 It is not coming . ami_da_4
D 533.89 Oh . ami_da_16
B 534.26 Function F eight ami_da_4
B 534.26 , okay . ami_da_4
B 539.74 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 540.8 Yeah . ami_da_4
D 541.27 No signal . ami_da_4
B 544.31 Computer . ami_da_3
C 548.09 There you go . ami_da_9
B 548.4 Computer adjusting , yeah . ami_da_9
D 549.11 Okay . ami_da_9
D 549.86 Cool . ami_da_9
D 554.26 Okay and then how do I press the the big one , to get it on to the big ami_da_5
D 554.26 F five ami_da_12
D 554.26 and I press that again to get it off ami_da_5
D 554.26 as well do I ? ami_da_5
D 554.26 Okay , so I am the interface design designer , User Interface Designer sorry , I am concerned with w what effect the apparatus should have on the user ami_da_4
D 554.26 and I am I am also ami_da_2
D 554.26 I want to point out that our motto , put the fashion in electronics , so obviously we as a company we want to make our products trendy and fashionable , it is a big concern of ours . ami_da_4
B 554.42 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 557.2 F five . ami_da_4
C 560.84 , F five and escape will bring it back and just the left button for advancing . ami_da_4
B 561.04 Escape . ami_da_4
D 597.73 Okay , and how do I press n just the next button ? ami_da_5
D 597.73 The arrow ? ami_da_5
D 597.73 Okay . ami_da_9
C 600.49 just a left left mouse button . ami_da_4
D 603.65 So I looked at existing designs ami_da_4
D 603.65 and also the information that Raj gave us was very useful about what people like , what people dislike . ami_da_9
D 613.34 and what people fashionable , because we said people between twenty five and thirty five were the main buyers of of our TV I think . ami_da_4
C 625.03 Okay . ami_da_1
D 625.29 So what they like and what they find fashionable . ami_da_4
C 630.14 Okay . ami_da_1
D 630.6 And ergonomics , ami_da_4
D 630.6 we said , ami_da_2
D 630.6 I do not know I have not actually been able to do any of this myself , but maybe that comes up , I do not know . ami_da_4
C 639.59 That can come under Arlo as well . ami_da_9
D 640.66 And the findings , well the basic that was the basic function to send messages to the television set . ami_da_4
D 648.63 That is what people want to do . ami_da_4
D 650.36 , so they need to be included , , but I have got some pictures here of some leading ones . ami_da_4
D 657.96 I do not know how to get to them , ami_da_4
D 657.96 do I press F five is it ? ami_da_5
D 657.96 escape ? ami_da_5
D 657.96 Oh okay , cool . ami_da_9
C 659.74 if you if you escape then you can see your bar . ami_da_4
D 665.9 I have not got my glasses on ami_da_4
D 665.9 so I hope it is this one . ami_da_4
D 669.02 These are two leading remote controls at the moment . ami_da_4
C 669.26 okay . ami_da_1
D 673.49 You know they are grey , ami_da_4
D 673.49 they have ami_da_2
D 673.49 I mean this one is got loads of buttons , it is hard to tell from here what they actually do , ami_da_4
D 673.49 and they do not look very exciting at all . ami_da_9
C 673.74 Okay . ami_da_1
D 683.24 , personally I prefer this one just because it is looks easier use , it is a bit more sleek with more of this silver stuff , ami_da_9
D 683.24 , but there you go , that is what we are up against , ami_da_4
D 683.24 and I think we can do much better than that . ami_da_9
A 699.96 Of course . ami_da_9
D 700.29 hang on . ami_da_16
C 700.81 We hope so . ami_da_9
D 703.97 F five , ami_da_16
D 703.97 okay , sorry . ami_da_14
D 708.37 Personal preferences . ami_da_4
D 709.69 , well I think we need to l ami_da_9
D 709.69 I think the ergonomics is quite important , Uh huh . ami_da_9
C 717.71 Yeah , particularly if we have there was a bit in Raj is about RSI and things as well . ami_da_9
B 723.4 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 724.27 And I thought not too edgy and like a box , more kind of hand held more not as computery and ami_da_6
D 724.27 or organic , yeah ami_da_9
D 724.27 , more organic shape I think . ami_da_9
C 735.13 Organic . ami_da_6
D 739.12 simple designs , like the last one we just saw , not too many buttons ami_da_6
D 739.12 and as Raj pointed out , only ten percent fifty percent of people only use ten percent of the buttons , ami_da_4
D 739.12 so I think what we can miss out on the buttons we can make up for in design and and how nice it looks . ami_da_9
C 754.08 Sales , . ami_da_9
C 757.24 Okay . ami_da_1
D 757.78 , hand held and portable I think is portamint is important ami_da_9
D 757.78 because TFT have just released I think is it a a remote control for presentations or and a big seven inch big screen , anyway , so ami_da_4
D 757.78 Yeah , no seven inches is not that big ami_da_9
D 757.78 but anyway so hand held and portable ami_da_6
D 757.78 and m I thought about other functions for TV ami_da_4
D 757.78 but as you pointed out people do not actually want that , ami_da_4
D 757.78 so maybe we forget about that . ami_da_6
C 770.8 Yeah it is like a , yeah . ami_da_9
C 775.51 It is . ami_da_4
C 785.0 Right . ami_da_1
C 789.76 And also the company want to keep it stuck to the TV for to keep down the production time . ami_da_4
B 789.81 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 795.41 It is for one TV ami_da_9
D 795.41 oh right ami_da_9
D 795.41 okay , sure . ami_da_9
D 798.53 And so the last thing I thought w which I quickly mentioned in the other one ami_da_4
D 798.53 was maybe a bit of a gimmick to set us apart from other people , like glow in the dark ami_da_6
D 798.53 which does already e exist but it is not very widely used I do not think . ami_da_4
B 807.2 Exactly . ami_da_9
B 807.96 Yeah . ami_da_9
C 811.33 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 814.03 Easy finder with the a whistle function or something , or rechargeable station because it is a pain when you run out of batteries . ami_da_6
C 816.51 Okay . ami_da_1
C 821.36 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 821.78 And I think that , yep , that is it . ami_da_4
C 824.79 That is cool . ami_da_9
A 825.35 So , I noticed your talk about speech recognition and whistling , ami_da_4
A 825.35 and I was just curious to know , have we done any research into how many people can whistle ? ami_da_5
A 825.35 , or if ami_da_2
A 825.35 is that a function we want in the remote ? ami_da_11
A 825.35 I do not , but ami_da_4
A 825.35 I ami_da_4
A 825.35 I know a lot of people do right . ami_da_4
D 825.45 Okay ? ami_da_11
D 840.32 , I have not been able to ami_da_3
D 840.32 , yeah ami_da_9
D 840.32 or some sort of voice ami_da_4
D 840.32 Yeah . ami_da_9
C 840.48 , do you have trouble whistling ? ami_da_5
C 840.48 Really ? ami_da_5
C 840.48 Ooh . ami_da_16
A 845.89 Yeah ami_da_9
A 845.89 it just ami_da_2
A 845.89 I mean it has to be a certain kind of whistle too , right ? ami_da_4
A 845.89 That is costly though . ami_da_9
C 848.55 Yeah , I suppose that is true . ami_da_9
C 849.66 Well I suppo you could y ami_da_2
C 849.66 you could have the ami_da_2
C 849.66 you could have the basically instead of a whistle if it is got the voice recognition you could have it just , you know , where are you ? . ami_da_6
B 859.4 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 860.41 a much easier thing is just any loud noise like clapping , shouting , you know , ami_da_4
A 860.41 and then , what would the response be ? ami_da_5
A 860.41 It beeps back at you or something ? ami_da_5
A 860.41 Okay . ami_da_9
B 864.83 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 866.58 Sounds good . ami_da_9
D 871.56 Yeah , something . ami_da_4
A 875.68 Well , let me set this up . ami_da_7
A 879.75 So I plug it in , press F five ? ami_da_5
A 879.75 Function F five ? ami_da_5
A 879.75 Or function F eight ? ami_da_12
A 879.75 Okay . ami_da_9
C 883.3 Function F eight for the the ami_da_4
C 883.3 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 889.48 Oh you need to twiddle the thingamibobsy thing . ami_da_4
A 893.2 Okay . ami_da_9
A 893.71 I think it is just to lock it in . ami_da_9
A 897.08 It is got it . ami_da_4
D 898.12 Okay . ami_da_9
A 902.38 Okay . ami_da_2
A 906.81 So as the Industrial Designer my job is to take an input from you guys , ami_da_4
A 906.81 so it is good you went first , ami_da_9
A 906.81 and I jotted down some notes as to what are the b needs and what kind of novel features we can add to differentiate our product from the others . ami_da_4
C 914.26 Alright . ami_da_1
C 917.08 Let is remember that . ami_da_6
A 926.13 so Raj told us that consumers are willing to spend more for fancy products , and he also mentioned that the current products do not always match users' operating behaviour . ami_da_4
A 942.61 , a lot of the buttons are not used , ami_da_4
A 942.61 and ami_da_2
A 942.61 he mentioned that they are not fun to use . ami_da_4
A 951.43 And a novel feature which we just brought up was this this automatic speech recognition feature or noise detection feature for when you lose the remote , there could be a little microphone on it , and any noise over a certain threshold it will pick up as a a distress signal from you and it will beep back and say you know ami_da_4
A 951.43 oh here I am or something of this sort . ami_da_4
C 973.62 But sure surely that would have to be sort of specific rather than above a threshold because if you had a loud movie on you are likely to get it beeping back at you . ami_da_9
A 982.02 Oh yeah , ami_da_9
A 982.02 yeah , that is true . ami_da_9
A 983.99 Well maybe you could have a ami_da_2
A 983.99 tha that would be a consideration to take into account yes . ami_da_9
C 992.75 Sorry I did not mean to derail you there . ami_da_14
A 994.31 Yeah well tha that is for later down the road , ami_da_9
A 994.31 and then as for the user interface it should be trendy , and not computery , right , so more low tech and not too many buttons . ami_da_4
A 1008.44 So I took these all into consideration and also I have some limitations from the boss . ami_da_4
A 1014.4 Right , ami_da_2
A 1014.4 and practical limitations which I kind of threw out the window . ami_da_4
A 1022.45 And so I did a little research and unfortunately all I had to work on was our our corporate archives of the great products we have made before , which include , you know , space craft , coffee makers , and bullet trains ami_da_4
A 1022.45 Or or a high speed train . ami_da_4
C 1039.25 is that what that is ? ami_da_9
C 1039.25 Well that is cool . ami_da_9
A 1042.04 Right ami_da_2
A 1042.04 and having personally worked with all these products I have a great deal of experience with with industrial design of these . ami_da_4
C 1049.09 If you if you can build space craft you will have no problem with a remote control , ami_da_14
C 1049.09 yeah . ami_da_14
A 1051.94 Right . ami_da_2
D 1052.24 Yeah sure . ami_da_1
A 1053.01 So , ami_da_2
A 1053.01 I figured , just put them all together . ami_da_14
A 1058.01 You got a a caffeine powered space shuttle train transport to your TV , and as for the user interface problem , you know , too many buttons . ami_da_14
A 1071.04 Give it one button and and it is a you know , for the the cowboy in all of us ami_da_14
A 1071.04 I I am not quite sure what the the function is there but ami_da_4
A 1071.04 Yeah it is a g ami_da_3
A 1071.04 I mean you could have a ami_da_3
A 1071.04 you know a ami_da_3
A 1071.04 Right . ami_da_4
C 1082.95 Right okay . ami_da_9
D 1082.97 Well I like that design . ami_da_9
C 1087.8 Is that just switches on the speech recognition and it is entirely speech operated , is it ? ami_da_5
C 1087.8 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 1091.98 So I think I I missed the budget thing , ami_da_4
A 1091.98 it was fifty million Euros ? ami_da_5
A 1091.98 And we gotta sell twenty five of them ? ami_da_5
A 1091.98 Right . ami_da_9
C 1095.42 Yeah . ami_da_4
D 1098.34 Yeah , ami_da_4
D 1098.34 not a problem . ami_da_9
B 1099.68 Fifty million was prof ami_da_3
B 1099.68 As a profit . ami_da_4
A 1099.91 Okay . ami_da_9
C 1100.1 now it is ami_da_4
C 1100.1 fif fifty million Euros we have gotta ami_da_4
C 1100.1 we have g ami_da_4
C 1100.1 gotta make profit , ami_da_9
C 1100.1 so we are making that at twelve and a half Euros a time . ami_da_4
A 1104.78 Oh okay , ami_da_9
A 1104.78 so I I mixed those numbers . ami_da_9
A 1108.86 Okay . ami_da_9
A 1109.83 Well I guess more realistically then ami_da_6
A 1109.83 , we need a product that is got some kind of nifty outer casing , cheap plastic , you know , that should be just like a tenth of the price maybe or less . ami_da_6
A 1122.56 An energy source which would probably just be your regular batteries ami_da_6
A 1122.56 , we do not want to have it ami_da_3
C 1126.28 Okay . ami_da_9
C 1127.47 Would it be possible to have the rechargeable idea ? ami_da_5
C 1127.47 Is that is that going to mark up a lot ? ami_da_5
C 1127.47 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 1131.46 Or a little base station or something , . ami_da_6
A 1133.48 Yeah , ami_da_9
A 1133.48 yeah , we could do that too . ami_da_9
A 1136.04 , I had not thought of that . ami_da_4
A 1137.47 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 1137.95 That might cost more though , ami_da_9
D 1137.95 because obviously with batteries we do not need to provide , well we provide the first batteries , but it is more , it is that is cheaper to just provide batteries . ami_da_4
C 1143.65 Yeah , ami_da_1
C 1143.65 yeah . ami_da_1
A 1146.15 Right . ami_da_1
C 1146.46 I mean if you think about these base stations now it is essentially just a a lead with a sort of self connecting brake in it , ami_da_4
C 1146.46 so I do not think it would up up the price that much . ami_da_9
D 1151.55 A battery in it , kind of . ami_da_4
A 1154.31 Right , ami_da_1
A 1154.31 so so the unirs the user interface ami_da_2
A 1154.31 the canonical user interface for these would be just a bunch of buttons , but since we are a cutting edge company , we of course will have alternatives like speech recognition , whistling recognition and rocket power behind our product . ami_da_4
D 1154.68 Okay . ami_da_1
D 1156.83 Okay . ami_da_1
C 1173.25 Okay . ami_da_9
A 1175.59 and lastly the transmission interface is , just some engineering thing you do not have to worry about . ami_da_4
C 1181.86 Okay . ami_da_9
A 1183.22 so here is you know , a great schematic that my apprentice designer gave me . ami_da_4
A 1189.38 as you can see the the remote control have parts and those parts look like that ami_da_4
A 1189.38 and ami_da_2
A 1189.38 you know it is got a little operating procedure that looks something like that . ami_da_4
A 1204.12 And I suppose you all know how it works because we have all used it and we would not be in a company designing remote controls if we did not know what they were so ami_da_4
A 1204.12 personal preferences , I think programmable options which just require a small amount of memory , ami_da_6
A 1204.12 non volatile memory , ami_da_4
A 1204.12 just so the user can put in their favourite channels and maybe their preferred volume settings so that when they turn it on it is not blasting . ami_da_6
D 1232.17 that is a good idea actually I like the programmable options . ami_da_9
B 1234.12 Yeah , me too . ami_da_9
A 1235.54 Oh okay . ami_da_9
A 1236.48 And the , the bells and whistles that we mentioned you know , they take more budgeting , more technical expenditure of effort and it is also much more likely to not work if if we add these bells and whistles . ami_da_4
C 1249.02 Right . ami_da_1
D 1249.05 okay . ami_da_1
C 1251.68 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 1253.75 That is all I got . ami_da_4
C 1254.23 Okay , ami_da_9
C 1254.23 thank you very much , ami_da_14
C 1254.23 I will take that back . ami_da_7
A 1262.59 Ooh that is tight . ami_da_9
C 1264.07 Right , also so a notice I got not very long before the meeting , so did not manage to forward it on to you , ami_da_4
C 1264.07 it is ami_da_2
C 1264.07 let is see , ami_da_16
C 1264.07 I will find it myself , ami_da_7
C 1264.07 Ta ami_da_3
C 1264.07 nah . ami_da_9
A 1283.0 Okay , I do not think we need to screw it in . ami_da_4
A 1285.25 Just push it . ami_da_4
B 1288.33 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 1292.12 We had that to dis include teletext because it is become outdated , and everybody uses the internet anyway . ami_da_4
C 1303.08 , dunno what Oracle would have to say with that but never mind . ami_da_9
C 1306.88 it is only for the television , which I am presuming means it is for a specific television , and instead of colours and sorta colour options , they want corporate colour and slogan somehow implemented in the new design . ami_da_4
D 1312.17 Okay . ami_da_1
D 1323.28 Corporate colour . ami_da_12
C 1324.42 Yellow . ami_da_4
D 1325.52 Okay . ami_da_9
A 1326.16 Yellow . ami_da_9
C 1329.17 I presume . ami_da_4
C 1330.5 , everything , all their sort of you know the corporate website and everything is yellow . ami_da_4
C 1339.75 And the logo the sort of slogan we put the fa fashion in electronics ami_da_4
C 1339.75 I do not know exactly how sort of incorpor ami_da_9
C 1339.75 I mean , I guess if you are going for a sort of globular shape you could kind of have it working its way round it or something . ami_da_6
D 1356.72 Yeah . ami_da_9
C 1359.09 , where am I ? ami_da_16
C 1359.09 Okay , so , we have to decide on which functions we are going to actually have . ami_da_6
D 1359.38 Okay . ami_da_1
D 1372.32 Okay . ami_da_9
C 1373.13 , now , ami_da_2
C 1373.13 we had as listed options we had speech recognition potentially , flat screen interface , LCD interface we also want to limit the number of buttons ami_da_4
C 1373.13 so we will pretty much take that one as read . ami_da_9
C 1394.69 We will use the the basic functions for a television . ami_da_6
C 1397.56 No teletext . ami_da_4
C 1400.49 okay hold on . ami_da_2
D 1401.67 Although the the danger with that is , it could look a bit cheap . ami_da_9
C 1406.71 Not enough buttons you mean ? ami_da_11
C 1406.71 So sorta strike a balance between a a few and a ami_da_6
C 1406.71 or it looks like we are just cutting on the ami_da_9
C 1406.71 I do however have this from over my head , that they do not want teletext on it . ami_da_4
D 1408.23 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 1409.22 Well ami_da_3
D 1415.28 On the number of buttons , kind of functions and stuff . ami_da_9
D 1420.0 , okay . ami_da_9
D 1422.44 Okay , cool . ami_da_9
C 1424.26 maybe Raj you could find out what people would think about that , ami_da_6
C 1424.26 or maybe they will send some information about that , ami_da_4
C 1424.26 about what people , ami_da_2
C 1424.26 whether people would require teletext in a remote teletext option in a remote control . ami_da_4
B 1429.86 About cost . ami_da_5
B 1438.09 Okay . ami_da_9
C 1442.39 Okay . ami_da_2
C 1446.25 So I take it your position Arlo ami_da_11
C 1446.25 is that the bells and whistles we have gotta come up with the a gimmick but not too complicated a gimmick . ami_da_11
A 1456.34 Yeah yeah . ami_da_9
C 1456.78 so I mean a a the sort of inkling I am getting from little bits of web chatter that I am getting sent is that they are quite interested in a TFT display , interactive display . ami_da_4
C 1470.4 However that does sound a bit like the more complicated design that rav ami_da_9
C 1470.4 sorry ami_da_9
C 1470.4 Raj said people did not like . ami_da_9
C 1483.89 Although I guess if there is a sort of ami_da_2
C 1483.89 If you think about standard interfaces that people use already , sort of Windows style drop down menus or whatever , ami_da_4
C 1483.89 I think maybe that is a bit , going a bit far ami_da_9
C 1483.89 but you know like in a basic sense that you could have your basic selection of buttons , and if you hit a sort of menu at the top you have it goes to a different selection of buttons , ami_da_6
C 1483.89 so it sorta keeps it simple . ami_da_9
D 1493.6 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 1508.03 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 1509.64 Okay . ami_da_1
C 1510.68 glow in the dark , is that sort of with a light inside it or is it sort of glow in the dark material ? ami_da_8
C 1510.68 Okay . ami_da_9
D 1516.47 Glow in the dark material I was thinking . ami_da_6
C 1520.36 So ami_da_2
C 1520.36 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 1520.61 , so I I guess that would be cheaper than a light I think . ami_da_4
B 1520.97 I ami_da_3
B 1520.97 may I say something about ? ami_da_7
B 1520.97 actually I think it is really really very important point as if we look at the market ami_da_9
B 1520.97 because people mor fifty percent people they find that the remote controls are often lost somewhere in the remote , in the room . ami_da_4
C 1524.52 Yeah . ami_da_9
B 1538.54 But ami_da_3
B 1538.54 yeah are lost and means they forget where they have kept the remote control last time . ami_da_4
D 1538.55 Often lost s was that , ami_da_12
D 1538.55 yeah . ami_da_9
C 1539.58 Lost , yeah . ami_da_4
B 1544.34 But if we add speech recognition as well as glow in the dark then both these factors will help their locating the remote control , ami_da_9
B 1544.34 like if they come and speak something at the remote control replies to something something and it glows in the dark . ami_da_4
B 1560.05 Both these factors both these points will help them to locate the where they have kept this remote control , ami_da_4
B 1560.05 and this will definitely enhance our market sales , ami_da_9
B 1560.05 so we should take it into consideration also . ami_da_6
C 1564.02 That is cool . ami_da_1
C 1566.14 That is cool . ami_da_1
C 1573.21 Okay , cool . ami_da_9
C 1574.45 speech recognition I take it ami_da_3
C 1574.45 I do not , I have ami_da_2
C 1574.45 I know of no products that use speech recognition well . ami_da_4
A 1574.52 Well . ami_da_3
A 1579.49 Oh it is ami_da_3
A 1579.49 They are act there ami_da_2
A 1579.49 there was a remote control that came out two years ago that had a some basic speech recognition on it . ami_da_4
A 1589.62 You could programme it with your channels and then you say you know like BBC one ami_da_4
A 1589.62 and it goes to that channel . ami_da_4
C 1595.83 Really ? ami_da_5
A 1596.69 Yeah , it did not work very well though because of this noise interference problem . ami_da_4
A 1600.02 They mentioned you know if the television says you are listening to BBC one . ami_da_4
C 1603.49 Yeah , ami_da_9
C 1603.49 or a yeah an advert an advert for BBC two on BBC one will switch the channel for you kind of thing . ami_da_4
A 1608.8 Right , right , ami_da_9
A 1608.8 and so there was a lot of this , you would be watching the TV and then all of a sudden it would it would pick up a noise and turn it off ami_da_4
A 1608.8 or you know or turn the volume off or something , ami_da_4
A 1608.8 but if you can work around that that noise problem ami_da_6
A 1608.8 Right . ami_da_1
D 1616.73 Okay . ami_da_1
C 1620.26 Uh huh . ami_da_1
D 1620.61 Well what about ami_da_2
D 1620.61 this might get a bit too expensive actually , ami_da_9
D 1620.61 but what about something that is built into the TV that you can press and it will send out a little signal you know like the ones that we ca not hear or something that that will activate the remote control starts to beep . ami_da_6
C 1635.54 , that is a good idea . ami_da_9
C 1640.95 So like a kind of backwards remote from the telly . ami_da_9
D 1641.55 If you find if y ami_da_3
D 1641.55 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 1643.87 Right and then it would do just you know , subtractive kind of cancellation of the noise . ami_da_9
A 1649.31 What you could do then would be you have a remote controlled by the TV speaker , ami_da_6
A 1649.31 or not a remo ami_da_4
A 1649.31 I am sorry , ami_da_4
A 1649.31 a microphone by the TV speaker and a transmitter there that sends back to your remote , ami_da_6
A 1649.31 because you ca not expect the the television manufacturers to to put that feature into their TVs . ami_da_4
D 1665.05 Yeah , that is the only thing , yeah . ami_da_9
A 1666.67 But yeah , then you have like the little se separate module by the TV speaker ami_da_6
A 1666.67 which ami_da_3
A 1666.67 Right , and then the remote control would know what is being produced by the television . ami_da_4
C 1669.79 That we should just stick on , ami_da_6
C 1669.79 yeah . ami_da_11
D 1671.4 That comes with our remote control . ami_da_5
C 1673.22 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 1673.42 Yeah . ami_da_9
C 1675.45 And that is a sort of basic RF kind of frequency so it will be cheap . ami_da_4
A 1678.56 Right , right . ami_da_9
A 1681.57 Right , right . ami_da_9
A 1683.73 Yeah that is certainly possible ami_da_9
A 1683.73 then an another thing was about this losing the remote and trying to find it again . ami_da_4
A 1688.72 If you do have this sorta speech interface to it , you do not even need to find it . ami_da_4
A 1692.49 You just say you know , whatever you whatever you want the remote for , you know to change the channel or to turn the TV on and off , you just shout your command to it and it would do it for you if it is within you know , within hearing range . ami_da_4
C 1705.72 Uh huh . ami_da_1
A 1706.03 And you know it could be somewhere in the room y ami_da_4
A 1706.03 that you have no idea where it is ami_da_4
A 1706.03 and it would still do its job . ami_da_4
D 1710.71 That could also be built into the TV though , which might make our remote control a bit obsolete . ami_da_9
C 1714.7 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 1715.51 Well , hopefully we are we are ahead of the curve . ami_da_9
C 1716.23 It might do us out of a job . ami_da_9
D 1717.72 Yeah , okay . ami_da_9
C 1719.85 Okay . ami_da_2
C 1727.75 I like the whole sort of remote feedback thing . ami_da_9
C 1733.72 so I think rather than ami_da_3
C 1733.72 and that also kind of takes out the speech recognition in terms of the interference of it not working very well and things like that , ami_da_9
C 1733.72 so I th ami_da_3
C 1733.72 yeah and expense and the time . ami_da_9
D 1744.64 And the expense . ami_da_9
C 1747.44 So I think if we are going to go ami_da_3
C 1747.44 well I mean like the thing about the there is the problem with the TFT or the LCD kind of thing is if you are also wanting the the kind of organic globby sort of feeling to it ami_da_9
C 1747.44 then you might have trouble incorporating the screen . ami_da_9
C 1768.52 , but I guess not ami_da_9
C 1768.52 I thin we will just we will just pretend that is not a problem . ami_da_6
C 1773.54 and how are you about the glow in the dark material ? ami_da_11
C 1773.54 Is that ami_da_3
C 1773.54 Contrast contra well . ami_da_9
D 1781.12 Maybe not even all of it ami_da_6
D 1781.12 because we said colours and fashion w were important ami_da_4
D 1781.12 so maybe just like a little l line that is kind of around the outside ami_da_6
D 1781.12 and then you can make the rest a different colour . ami_da_6
A 1791.8 Yeah , no th the material is cheap but it is just the the glow in the dark material needs some light to charge it you know , ami_da_9
A 1791.8 and then if you are , if you are sitting in the dark for too long it it wo not glow any more . ami_da_4
C 1799.28 Yeah , okay . ami_da_9
C 1801.03 So if it is dow it is d ami_da_3
C 1801.03 yeah . ami_da_9
C 1803.53 Or if it is down under the couch cushions which is where I usually find mine . ami_da_4
A 1805.41 Right . ami_da_1
A 1807.65 Right . ami_da_1
C 1807.7 Okay , well we can use ami_da_2
C 1807.7 we can still use the glow in the dark as a gimmick essentially , ami_da_6
C 1807.7 if we are going to have to ami_da_2
C 1807.7 if we are going to have the logo on as well , bright yellow logo in our our slogan . ami_da_4
D 1814.45 Yeah , ami_da_9
D 1814.45 because what I thought , main ami_da_3
D 1814.45 Slogan , yeah . ami_da_9
C 1825.54 then you know they are going to be fairly brightly coloured anyway , ami_da_4
C 1825.54 and we can have sort of a a a trimming as well , of the glow in the dark material , just as gimmickyness . ami_da_6
D 1830.07 Right . ami_da_1
D 1835.19 Because yeah , that w more than finding it , that was more like ami_da_9
D 1835.19 you know if you are watching a film in the dark , you can still see the remote control . ami_da_9
C 1844.54 Alright , so n sorta if if if we are gon if we are going to go with the idea of of feedback , sort of remote finder , then that kind of stuffs that one out then . ami_da_9
D 1845.6 That was more of a a gimmick . ami_da_4
C 1859.94 Do you think ? ami_da_11
C 1859.94 it makes it fairly unnecessary then . ami_da_9
D 1863.68 Yeah , unnecessary . ami_da_9
C 1864.18 Okay . ami_da_9
D 1864.7 Yeah . ami_da_9
C 1865.77 , okay so scratch that . ami_da_9
C 1869.55 so we have got ami_da_2
C 1869.55 do we want to go with the TFT idea or the is that far too expensive ? ami_da_11
C 1869.55 Well I mean I think I think the sort of find the finder things I mean it is I could probably write the circuit diagram for that myself . ami_da_9
A 1875.24 yeah we are getting a lot of features now , ami_da_9
A 1875.24 I I think ami_da_3
A 1875.24 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 1888.52 Well , I think a consideration too is that these remotes get abused a lot , ami_da_9
A 1888.52 you know they get thrown around , there is a good chance the the TFT screen would break or get damaged . ami_da_4
A 1898.94 They are pretty fragile . ami_da_4
D 1899.95 So is that one of our definite requirements that they wa that it needs a TFT screen ? ami_da_5
D 1899.95 Yeah you think so ? ami_da_11
D 1899.95 Okay . ami_da_9
C 1900.24 Okay . ami_da_1
C 1904.17 no , I mean that was going on ravs Raj is sort of marketing research I guess . ami_da_4
C 1911.77 So we will stick with sort of programmability for the buttons that we do have . ami_da_6
C 1931.51 So that is sort of included in your sub module kind of stuff , you were finding out about teletext . ami_da_4
A 1936.48 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 1945.76 If you could find out that I think we are going to scratch the speech recognition as a bit of a expensive , ami_da_6
C 1945.76 no ? ami_da_11
C 1945.76 Oh right ami_da_9
C 1945.76 , okay . ami_da_9
B 1946.21 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 1949.22 Totally , it takes cheap speech recognition , ami_da_5
B 1949.22 she they wi ami_da_3
B 1949.22 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 1956.1 Oh . ami_da_16
A 1959.73 Oh no it is it is much cheaper than the TFT , it is just a microphone and some some integrated circuits . ami_da_4
C 1965.97 Is it not the circuits that cost ami_da_5
C 1965.97 Oh right ami_da_9
C 1965.97 , okay . ami_da_9
A 1966.2 And it would it would be a small vocabulary speech recognition system , ami_da_4
A 1966.2 like a ami_da_3
A 1966.2 Okay . ami_da_9
C 1972.18 well that kind of takes back the RF the RF remote sort of idea as well . ami_da_9
C 1982.89 Five minutes . ami_da_4
C 1983.99 Okay . ami_da_2
C 1985.49 Decisions . ami_da_4
C 1986.91 , votes , let is vote . ami_da_6
C 1988.65 Who wants TFT ? ami_da_11
C 1988.65 No one does . ami_da_9
C 1992.16 Excellent , ami_da_9
C 1992.16 so we will go with speech recognition , yeah ? ami_da_6
C 1992.16 , speech recognition , limited buttons , organic design . ami_da_9
D 1995.41 , that is cool . ami_da_9
D 2003.11 if it is not too expensive s ami_da_9
D 2003.11 I think it is a good gimmick . ami_da_9
C 2003.32 And what else was I thinking of that I have not written down and therefore fallen out my head , ami_da_5
C 2003.32 programmability . ami_da_4
B 2012.07 Glow in dark . ami_da_11

C 2114.21 Okay . ami_da_1
D 2114.29 What I thought as well about the material is maybe not this kind of material , but maybe more like this kind of rubbery material , ami_da_6
D 2114.29 it is a bit more bouncy , like you said they get chucked around a lot . ami_da_4
D 2127.63 , a bit more durable and that can also be ergonomic and it kind of feels a bit different from all the other remote controls . ami_da_9
C 2135.41 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 2138.2 The rubber rather than ami_da_4
A 2138.6 Yeah . ami_da_1

B 2147.52 means if children catch hold of your or if they chew it it should not be too harmful . ami_da_4
B 2160.22 So , whatever material we use it should be ami_da_6
