A 91.24 So ami_da_2
A 91.24 we are here to talk about functional design . ami_da_4
A 97.61 Now hopefully we have all got a better idea from than we did f leaving the last meeting as to what it is we are up to now . ami_da_4
A 105.79 So here is an agenda . ami_da_7
A 107.62 I will open . ami_da_4
A 109.13 you should know that I will be taking minutes during all the meetings , ami_da_7
A 109.13 as I was struggling to our last time and that will be easier for me now because I am not actually giving the whole presentation . ami_da_4
A 119.75 the additional points are just the stuff that we sent and that I forwarded on from upper management having a few bright ideas to make our lives painful . ami_da_4
A 128.03 now you can all give your presentations . ami_da_4
A 132.65 We can talk about the requirements and hopefully come to some decisions . ami_da_4
A 138.35 Right , forty minutes for this meeting , so a bit more time than the last one . ami_da_4
A 141.94 Here is the additional points ami_da_4
A 141.94 I just wanted to put those in there to see if you guys had any comments on them . ami_da_11
A 149.43 did you all receive that email ? ami_da_5
A 149.43 So does anyone have any overall ami_da_8
B 151.33 Yep . ami_da_4
D 151.36 Yeah . ami_da_4
D 156.36 Well what comes up for me is that if we are going to if we are going to be marketing a product that is going to be having no teletext , people are very comfortable with the idea of having teletext and using teletext , and so we are not we are going to be a new product without something that people are very comfortable having right now . ami_da_4
A 172.04 Yep . ami_da_1
D 178.97 So that is , from a marketing perspective I ami_da_4
D 178.97 I see I see a lack . ami_da_4
D 183.92 And so we have to go , I think , in the other direction . ami_da_4
D 186.29 What are we going to have that makes this thing better than ami_da_8
D 186.29 Right . ami_da_9
A 189.08 Well tha that first point could also be an op opportunity because in seeing that teletext is becoming outdated , some sort remote control that can work with the Internet there is the opportunity that is presented , I guess . ami_da_4
D 198.61 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 198.82 No , I I agree with you . ami_da_9
D 200.09 So what I am talking about is I see that one side we are eliminating something so we have to come up with another side which is , what are we going to be targeting our market that identifies our product as better than ami_da_4
D 200.09 because it does not have teletext ami_da_4
D 200.09 it has ta ta ta ami_da_4
D 200.09 ta ta . ami_da_4
A 200.33 Okay . ami_da_1
D 213.15 So that is that is that was my reactions . ami_da_4
A 213.3 Okay . ami_da_1
A 215.09 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 215.36 but but we are sort of being dictated that this should only be for the television . ami_da_4
D 218.15 Yeah yeah . ami_da_1
A 219.03 So we are quite fixed . ami_da_4
D 220.39 Yep . ami_da_1
A 220.55 So we are really probably , in terms of marketing , are looking for that ami_da_4
A 220.55 is that is a cost winner rather than a fantastic new feature product . ami_da_4
D 228.26 Okay . ami_da_9
C 228.51 Yeah bu but we we are designing only the remote ami_da_4
C 228.51 , we not design the TV . ami_da_4
A 228.54 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 232.63 So we are going to be removing the teletext out of any TV that we people use our remote with . ami_da_4
D 237.3 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 237.81 Okay . ami_da_3
D 239.57 That is right . ami_da_9
D 240.13 I think we take with you . ami_da_3
C 240.32 So it is kind of a stupid decision . ami_da_9
A 241.66 But there is also the potential for mark there is a market here for our lost teletext . ami_da_4
B 242.12 Right . ami_da_1
A 245.53 For example someone that just goes to the shop that wants a replacement wants it as cheap as possible . ami_da_4
A 250.03 Twenty five Euros is the selling price , we really have to innovate here I guess . ami_da_4
D 254.15 That is what I am that is what I am talking about is is that we have to find something that is going to be very attractive about this product because somebody , some people are going to be hap unhappy because it took they ca not ac access their teletext . ami_da_4
D 265.62 Okay . ami_da_2
D 266.49 Because we are talking about eighty percent or ninety percent or ninety five percent of the televisions out there are are teletext . ami_da_4
A 274.4 K yeah . ami_da_1
D 274.66 So so it is it is not that I am criticizing the product at all . ami_da_4
D 278.3 It is just when we eliminate that then what do we bring ? ami_da_4
D 278.3 What are we bringing in to take the place of this , ami_da_4
D 278.3 and we have to d in my opinion we have to double up . ami_da_6
A 283.95 okay . ami_da_1
D 285.61 If we lose one we need to bring two or three . ami_da_6
A 288.08 Okay . ami_da_1
A 290.45 Okay ami_da_2
A 290.45 I think that the last point is probably quite straightforward . ami_da_9
A 295.18 Obviously the the w it has to be branded . ami_da_4
C 299.38 So then the double R will be our our ami_da_5
C 299.38 I tho I tho I thou ami_da_3
C 299.38 I think Rol Ro Rolls Royce might mind , but do not worry . ami_da_4
A 299.84 Okay . ami_da_1
A 303.57 On the product ami_da_4
A 303.57 yeah . ami_da_4
B 304.9 I think one of ami_da_3
B 304.9 I think w , yeah , one of the things that we should also keep in mind when we are doing this ami_da_4
B 304.9 I mean our company is slogan is we put the fashion in electronics , right . ami_da_4
A 305.24 Can you handle that black and yellow ? ami_da_5
B 319.46 So I think our kind of our target here is to have some kind of very like sleek nice look remote ami_da_4
B 319.46 and we want it to be functional as well , ami_da_4
B 319.46 but I think one of the main selling points is that we do not want it to be clunky like like this thing here . ami_da_4
B 334.73 You know we do not want to a big clunker . ami_da_4
B 336.41 We want something that looks nice and it is fashionable and so ami_da_4
B 336.41 That is fine . ami_da_9
D 342.54 So you have this ? ami_da_5
D 342.54 Now is would this be considered just a standard ami_da_5
D 342.54 This is not this is not cutting edge technology we are talking here . ami_da_4
A 343.49 Nah . ami_da_4
A 344.96 So we have three presentations , ami_da_4
A 344.96 and I think we will go in order of participant number here . ami_da_6
A 353.19 So we can have a look at the working design first from participant two . ami_da_6
A 357.48 That is ami_da_3
A 357.48 Okay . ami_da_1
C 359.32 Yes . ami_da_1
B 365.97 Okay so ami_da_2
B 365.97 so you all know me , I am the Industrial Designer . ami_da_4
A 367.33 it is enough . ami_da_3
A 368.21 But click it on off ? ami_da_3
A 368.21 Do we have an idea of costs of different components ? ami_da_5
A 368.21 Okay . ami_da_1
B 374.47 And we have some basic components that our remote is going to need , just basically every remote will need them . ami_da_4
B 380.4 We need some kind of of power d power source . ami_da_4
B 382.97 we have to decide on our our user interface , which is his department , but ami_da_4
B 382.97 the in user interface is also a major component . ami_da_4
B 390.71 we need a programmable digital signal processor to to take the input from the user and translate that into into electronic signal , which we pass to the infra red LED , which you aim at the television ami_da_4
B 390.71 which and it receives that signal . ami_da_4
B 409.71 You need a on off switch ami_da_4
B 409.71 I do not know how that got in there . ami_da_9
B 413.29 And we also need to have the if we want a universal remote we need to have encryption codes for the different makes of TVs . ami_da_4
B 422.23 So we need to know all the different you know all the different signals and so that will require some memory as well . ami_da_4
B 431.48 so here is just a basic layout of how how the remote would work . ami_da_4
B 437.48 You ha the v the power source is in the upper right hand corner there , and you can see that we have the user interface here which is connected to the chip which does all our signal processing , and then passes that signal on to the infra red LED and that signal is then emitted and received by the television at the photo transistor . ami_da_4
B 458.71 So those are the basic components that need to go into this and everything else is pretty much open to move around . ami_da_4
B 474.1 I think any des ami_da_3
B 474.1 No . ami_da_9
D 477.29 We are talking about existing technology . ami_da_4
B 479.14 Right ami_da_9
B 479.14 I think ami_da_3
B 479.14 Yeah ami_da_9
B 479.14 this is just this is just a basic layout of ev of all the components that w w are going to be absolutely necessary f to have a working remote . ami_da_4
D 479.54 Nothing is being modified or upgraded or new discoveries . ami_da_4
B 490.01 We can add things in like if we wanted some voice recognition , ami_da_6
B 490.01 I mean that I mean that you can kind of say would would fall under the user interface and the digital signal processing chip . ami_da_4
D 501.26 Okay . ami_da_1
D 502.02 Okay . ami_da_1
B 502.46 well the most the most costly components are going to be the chip ami_da_4
B 502.46 and the th it could als ami_da_3
B 502.46 basically the user interface and the casing are going to be expensive as well . ami_da_4
B 515.13 the LED and the the transistors and everything else are you know they are ami_da_4
B 515.13 they are pretty cheap . ami_da_4
B 521.72 So depending on what we want our functionality to be , the chip could be expensive or it could be cheap . ami_da_4
B 528.0 depending on the n amount of memory we need in there and stuff like that and h and h you know how much power . ami_da_4
A 528.05 okay . ami_da_1
A 533.54 Do we have any ballpark figures for that yet ? ami_da_5
A 533.54 No . ami_da_5
B 535.68 I do not have any figures right now . ami_da_4
A 537.83 Okay . ami_da_1
B 538.19 We we have to wait until we get to a more specific design phase for that . ami_da_4
A 541.8 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 542.51 N okay . ami_da_1
B 542.58 but and I think a significant part of the cost could be the actual the actual casing itself and ami_da_4
B 542.58 and you know the the b the buttons and things like that , I think . ami_da_4
D 555.81 the shell ? ami_da_12
D 555.81 Okay . ami_da_9
B 557.11 Yeah . ami_da_4
B 557.44 Basically yeah . ami_da_4
A 561.75 Okay . ami_da_1
B 563.22 So yeah . ami_da_2
B 563.69 That is all I have really . ami_da_4
A 565.45 Okay . ami_da_14
A 565.85 Thanks . ami_da_14
A 570.53 And we have participant three , which I believe is Pedro . ami_da_4
C 575.0 I ami_da_3
C 575.0 Hey mouse . ami_da_16
A 580.69 I can give you that to click on . ami_da_4
C 583.38 Open . ami_da_16
A 585.99 And you want to get ami_da_3
A 585.99 View a slide show , that is what you want to do , ami_da_6
A 585.99 yeah ? ami_da_6
A 585.99 Just go up to view . ami_da_6
C 587.4 When we are fighting over it is also more lot more fun . ami_da_14
B 594.64 Click , do not ami_da_6
B 594.64 Yeah . ami_da_6
A 596.01 okay ami_da_1
A 596.01 But I t I think what the the management recommendation was less that there is a worry that teletext will become outdated rather than we should not have it . ami_da_4
C 596.66 This does not work . ami_da_4
C 598.86 So yeah function design . ami_da_4
C 600.37 you guys know me , Pedro , and what I found is we want to do fashion ami_da_4
C 600.37 and I think , honestly , we should keep technology low and just simple basically and try to aim for design . ami_da_6
C 618.07 If ami_da_3
C 618.07 basically a case will will cost the same if it looks good or bad so we ma we have to make it look good . ami_da_4
C 626.04 something cute and small . ami_da_6
C 629.16 The big chunky remotes are died in the eighties . ami_da_4
C 631.49 So we should just go for something that people will like to actually look at . ami_da_6
C 637.3 And although mo most people will buy s televisions and everything for that have loads of loads of little functions and everything and they mostly end up using simple functions and little things and most the people wo not wo not get too mad of actually having to go the to the s to the television to , for instance , tune in their the stations . ami_da_4
C 661.37 There is no need to have that in the remote . ami_da_4
C 663.49 So ami_da_2
C 663.49 as for what I would recommend for the the interface design , and I will change the colours on the on the logo , but we should go for the user oriented device , ami_da_6
C 663.49 so simple controls and good ergonomics . ami_da_4
C 682.67 and although I th I th I am still here recommending the teletext ami_da_7
C 682.67 so I will remove that , I guess , ami_da_7
C 682.67 but we should go for the ami_da_3
C 682.67 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 699.59 So I I still think if it is cheap enough functionality wise to include , it really should be in there . ami_da_6
A 704.83 Because otherwise we are just going to ami_da_3
A 704.83 I mean even if it is necessary or not , if you if you are given the choice between a t a remote with teletext or without when it really if it i if it is not more expensive for us to k make because as far as I understand it , it can be operated with the same set of buttons , ami_da_4
A 704.83 yeah ? ami_da_4
A 704.83 So it should be in there . ami_da_6
B 724.61 Right as far as ami_da_3
B 724.61 i it is just the cost of an extra button . ami_da_4
B 728.13 I mean software wise there is really no difference . ami_da_4
A 728.88 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 731.12 Okay . ami_da_3
B 731.22 I think . ami_da_1
A 731.37 Is not ami_da_3
A 731.37 Well maybe what we are getting into here is the the idea of Internet through the TV for example . ami_da_4
D 732.24 I have maybe a silly question . ami_da_7
D 733.54 I in the very beginning it said with the with the advent of computers there is going to be the it is going to be out moded teletext . ami_da_4
D 740.55 I I do not understand how those two things are connected . ami_da_12
D 743.29 How does how does computers and teletext h how why is one eliminating the need of the other ? ami_da_5
D 743.29 I do not understand that . ami_da_12
A 755.95 So that might play on what we can do . ami_da_6
C 757.41 Yeah ami_da_9
C 757.41 the they are basically aiming at saying that you would use you know a couple of years ago teletext to be the easiest way to check like for the scheduling and the next programme and stuff like that ami_da_4
C 757.41 and now ami_da_3
C 757.41 Yeah ami_da_1
C 757.41 and now you can c look it over Internet . ami_da_4
B 764.56 Scheduling . ami_da_4
B 767.49 to find out what what you are watching even if there is commercials you know . ami_da_4
D 771.03 Okay . ami_da_1
C 773.01 But I still think teletext is way more convenient until until we have the same commodities . ami_da_9
B 774.46 I think I ha ami_da_3
B 774.46 I agree . ami_da_9
D 777.78 Yeah because , yeah , ami_da_9
D 777.78 I just I do not see the cross over between computers and television . ami_da_4
D 781.01 I mean I do see the cross over in some sense , but ami_da_4
D 781.01 but but but with the the remote is is used for television , okay . ami_da_4
C 783.44 Yeah , but it is not happen yet . ami_da_9
B 784.47 Well for me ami_da_3
B 784.47 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 784.84 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 785.06 Well you have digital TV still already . ami_da_4
D 787.92 So so if we make the cross over and we are going to view television on computers then we are then we are losing the the necessity of the remote . ami_da_4
B 791.32 Unless you have a ami_da_3
B 791.32 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 794.24 Well there there is a for example on digital TV systems you have you can press a button ami_da_4
A 794.24 and you can buy things in adverts , and you can you can view through a catalogue for example . ami_da_4
D 794.42 S ami_da_4
D 794.42 Okay . ami_da_1
A 803.02 A a family member of mine has got a system ami_da_3
A 803.02 where you just you can ami_da_3
A 803.02 Yeah , and there is other features for example on other systems where you can pause live TV and things like that . ami_da_4
A 812.23 They are just features from the Internet from computers are are coming into the TV sort of under the covers , but you still use it through a teletext . ami_da_4
A 820.32 So now the things to think here are that that there is going to be more functionality , potentially that we can handle . ami_da_4
D 820.45 Okay . ami_da_1
C 824.87 Yeah ami_da_9
C 824.87 but we we do not we are not aiming a command for that . ami_da_4
C 827.88 That is the thing . ami_da_4
C 828.45 And all of those require the other commands with more complexity and more software and ami_da_4
C 828.45 Yeah ami_da_9
C 828.45 but we would increase the price to try to make it a trainable one , so ami_da_4
C 828.45 Well I dunno . ami_da_9
B 832.93 I think a lot of that is proprietary anyways . ami_da_4
B 835.01 You are not going to be able to , you , like command a TiVo with our remote . ami_da_4
B 838.95 I do not think . ami_da_4
A 840.12 But still there there is an opportunity . ami_da_4
A 841.68 If if it is , for example , a trainable one then we are just simply having like an up , down , left , right , an okay button or something like that might might do as well in future proofing it . ami_da_6
A 857.17 Okay . ami_da_1
C 858.87 One way the other teletext was there ami_da_4
C 858.87 but I guess we can remove it ami_da_6
C 858.87 or , you know , make two separate interface designs . ami_da_6
B 864.88 I think if it is possible you should try to you know have a talk with management about that . ami_da_6
B 870.35 Just you know ami_da_6
B 870.35 Right it is just not ami_da_3
B 870.35 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 871.68 Yeah I do not I do not see the logic . ami_da_4
C 871.91 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 873.47 I I do not see the logic in elimination of teletext , ami_da_4
D 873.47 I ami_da_3
D 873.47 just I ami_da_3
D 873.47 I ami_da_3
D 873.47 but I am not a tech mind either . ami_da_4
C 873.48 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 876.6 Yeah , and neither do I in fact . ami_da_9
D 878.42 I just do not see the cross over between computers and and ami_da_4
D 878.42 and Because we are designing something for a television , okay . ami_da_4
A 881.64 Bu . ami_da_3
A 884.71 I will communicate that back to those guys there ami_da_7
A 884.71 a a and th the message really we want to be sending to them is that , although teletext may become outdated w there is no l logic in not having it in there anyway ami_da_4
A 884.71 i if it does not affect the price . ami_da_4
C 894.71 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 896.36 We are selling it to an existing market . ami_da_4
C 896.65 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 896.86 but I ami_da_4
A 896.86 I think what they are pushing us towards here is in terms of thinking of ways to future proof our system for future systems that have something else other than teletext maybe . ami_da_4
C 908.47 Yeah ami_da_9
C 908.47 but we are not putting some ami_da_4
C 908.47 there is no ami_da_4
C 908.47 no putting anything in in the place of teletext . ami_da_4
A 908.62 I dunno ami_da_3
A 908.62 I am ami_da_3
A 908.62 okay . ami_da_1
D 909.33 That is ami_da_3
D 909.33 Yeah , ami_da_9
D 909.33 and and , ami_da_3
D 909.33 yeah , ami_da_9
D 909.33 and and we are also marketing a product . ami_da_4
C 913.31 That is the problem . ami_da_4
D 915.77 It is what I am seeing is a is a mid range cost product . ami_da_4
D 918.47 So so w we ca not go and pump a whole bunch of technology into this thing because all of a sudden we are going to have cost overruns . ami_da_4
A 921.62 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 925.02 So if we drop if we are going to choose to drop teletext , again what are we adding to the product that makes it marketable ? ami_da_8
D 925.02 I do not I do not see it , ami_da_9
D 925.02 and to me if I am going to market a product for b for beauty for for design I am going to ami_da_4
D 925.02 I am going to try to market it at a much higher price . ami_da_4
A 932.18 So if we are keeping it basic we are loo loo what we are looking to sell it basically ami_da_4
A 932.18 is it is just being very easy to use , looking exceptionally good , that sort of thing . ami_da_4
A 942.32 Because we really do not have anything else there , do we ? ami_da_4
C 944.56 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 953.3 I need to make it special with a high price tag . ami_da_4
D 955.57 I do not want to make it economically ami_da_4
D 955.57 g competitive . ami_da_4
D 958.89 I want I want to market it as exclusive . ami_da_4
D 961.3 So I would market this product it at eighty nine Euros and come up with some really beautiful exterior design or something th ami_da_4
D 961.3 but ami_da_4
D 961.3 but I do not think we have that flexibility . ami_da_4
A 970.45 But i if design if design is cheap and functionality is basic , then twenty five Euros is probably a high price for a commoner garden stan standard TV ami_da_9
A 970.45 so the place remote the ami_da_3
A 970.45 then the place we are going to justify that cost is through through design through making it a a sleek elegant high priced basic remote . ami_da_4
A 991.4 Does that make sense , huh ? ami_da_13
D 992.08 No I ami_da_12
D 992.08 no ami_da_12
D 992.08 I ami_da_12
D 992.08 I understand what you say , ami_da_12
D 992.08 but what I am what I am , ami_da_3
D 992.08 okay we probably need to move along , ami_da_6
D 992.08 but my my concern is trying to find a marketing niche for this product , and if I am coming in with a with with twenty five Euros , which is mid market price , then what am I going to give these people for this ? ami_da_4
D 992.08 So that is just my question , but we can keep talking . ami_da_4
A 997.03 Yeah we probably should . ami_da_9
A 997.99 We we are doing alright for time . ami_da_4
A 1009.65 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 1012.39 Okay . ami_da_9
A 1013.4 Sorry that kind of cut into you there . ami_da_14
B 1014.86 Right . ami_da_2
C 1015.27 No ami_da_14
C 1015.27 just I I would I would advocate for continuing teletext and those would be the basic commands . ami_da_4
C 1020.83 as for , you know , the the case design maybe I will come up with more concrete ideas . ami_da_7
C 1026.24 Right now it is just the idea of simplicity and slickness , cute and small ami_da_4
C 1026.24 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 1032.12 I am just thinking you know with all these universal remotes that are out there , how many people how many people actually use every feature ami_da_4
B 1032.12 that ar ami_da_3
B 1032.12 you know i like these trainable remotes and things like that , where , you know , it is just so confusing to do to use all these functions . ami_da_9
B 1050.34 Where I think the largest portion of the market is just going to you know they lost their TV remote , they need another one that will work with their TV . ami_da_4
B 1057.75 They want something that looks nice , that that that is not going to break when they drop it , that you know that maybe it is it is ergonomic , it feels good in your hand , something like that . ami_da_4
B 1068.71 I think that is going to be where you are going to find the biggest , you know , market share . ami_da_4
A 1073.08 So we are looking for something that looks good and just works , rather than looking for any special features . ami_da_4
A 1077.4 Is that ami_da_3
B 1077.54 I think the more bells and whistles we add , it is just going to cut into our into our profits . ami_da_4
B 1081.89 Because I think as we as we add costs for things like for like if we add the voice recognition and things like that , I think you know what percentage of the of the of the market is actually going to use that ? ami_da_4
B 1081.89 Maybe five percent , you know , ami_da_4
B 1081.89 and how much ami_da_3
B 1081.89 Right . ami_da_1
C 1096.57 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 1098.55 But we can talk a little bit more potentially in the marketing marketing presentation about this . ami_da_6
B 1102.28 Yeah okay . ami_da_9
A 1102.86 Be a good idea . ami_da_9
B 1102.9 I am sorry . ami_da_14
A 1103.8 sorry , I did not mean to cut in . ami_da_14
D 1105.08 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 1105.17 Sorry boss . ami_da_14
A 1106.55 I am not the boss . ami_da_14
A 1108.32 Okay . ami_da_2
D 1108.56 Oh P Pedro , I just want to say quickly I ami_da_8
D 1108.56 I would really like it when you can come up with some more bells and whistles , eh . ami_da_8
D 1114.91 You know sell things come to my mind is something that is voice activated . ami_da_6
D 1122.07 I know we are getting into some , I hope , some big money on this thing , but ami_da_4
D 1122.07 Is that for over here ? ami_da_5
D 1122.07 Okay , alright . ami_da_12
A 1124.76 I think that is probably a question more for for this guy here , yeah . ami_da_4
B 1128.2 Yeah . ami_da_4
B 1129.3 Well it is kind of both of us . ami_da_4
B 1130.41 Us us user interface . ami_da_3
A 1130.59 Is it ? ami_da_5
A 1130.59 Okay . ami_da_1
D 1130.98 That is ami_da_3
D 1130.98 Because and I think of voice activated ami_da_6
D 1130.98 I think of of how many times I have I have lost my my remote ami_da_4
D 1130.98 and I ca not find it . ami_da_4
D 1139.78 So some way that I can I can find my remote by clapping my hands or something ami_da_6
D 1139.78 and and so so ami_da_3
D 1139.78 But this is just something . ami_da_9
B 1142.48 I was thinking about that . ami_da_9
B 1144.12 Then your lights would go off , though . ami_da_9
D 1150.01 I am trying to find some bells and whistles ami_da_4
D 1150.01 because when they talk about tel taking out teletext , it is like , what are we going to put in ? ami_da_8
D 1150.01 What makes this thing attractive ? ami_da_8
D 1150.01 And it is only for televisions . ami_da_4
D 1158.71 So we everyth ami_da_3
D 1158.71 our our competition out there has got these these multiple adaptors where they can use them for their VCRs , their DVDs , their their televisions and we are coming out with one remote for television only . ami_da_4
D 1171.95 And so to me we have to make this a really special product ami_da_4
D 1171.95 I ami_da_4
D 1171.95 I ami_da_4
D 1171.95 I do not s ami_da_4
D 1171.95 I really have to say I do not see the market niche for this product . ami_da_4
B 1172.88 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 1178.26 At this price I do not see it yet . ami_da_4
D 1179.74 I am I I go along with this , ami_da_7
D 1179.74 because this is what we are given to try to market , but I I do not see the market niche for this product without without some really sort of something really special to identify it as as unique in the market . ami_da_4
C 1194.21 But we th that should be design . ami_da_6
D 1196.31 Yeah . ami_da_9
C 1196.92 That should be the design basically . ami_da_6
B 1198.04 Right . ami_da_1
C 1198.74 I think technology we would we ami_da_4
C 1198.74 we are not in the price range to do it . ami_da_4
C 1203.22 We do not have the money to do it towards t ami_da_4
C 1203.22 f technology ami_da_4
C 1203.22 so we should we should aim at design . ami_da_6
D 1207.25 Okay . ami_da_1
D 1208.04 Have to do you have to do it in the box ? ami_da_5
D 1208.04 Okay well , so so that is up to you then ami_da_4
D 1208.04 to to make this box in something that is absolutely extraordinary . ami_da_9
C 1209.52 Yeah . ami_da_4
C 1210.59 Yeah . ami_da_4
A 1219.81 Okay . ami_da_2
D 1219.91 Maybe make it in the form of a gun . ami_da_6
D 1221.21 We can sell it in United States . ami_da_6
A 1224.43 I have a question for you . ami_da_7
A 1226.0 Does any of the the features that Pedro is spoken about here have any implications we might not have thought about on in terms of just pure functionality ? ami_da_5
A 1226.0 In terms of making it work or the cost of that or ami_da_5
A 1226.0 Okay . ami_da_1
B 1238.26 I do not ami_da_3
B 1238.26 I think all these things are pretty standard . ami_da_4
B 1241.72 I think we will be okay . ami_da_9
A 1244.53 Okay . ami_da_1
A 1245.28 Cheers . ami_da_14
A 1248.56 Onto participant four . ami_da_4
D 1260.72 Well you know for marketing f marketing for me is ami_da_3
D 1260.72 and how do I go here ? ami_da_5
D 1260.72 Okay . ami_da_12
B 1269.18 you can just click . ami_da_6
D 1270.43 Go go . ami_da_16
D 1272.29 Is that right ? ami_da_11
D 1272.29 Ah ha . ami_da_12
B 1272.34 No no no ami_da_9
B 1272.34 you just get off that . ami_da_6
B 1273.97 You just click anywhere . ami_da_6
D 1276.5 Yeah , what for me is it ami_da_3
D 1276.5 I d I do not know what I am marketing right now , okay , until you spoke and when I wrote this , I do not know what I am marketing . ami_da_4
D 1285.35 I just know that I I was identified as a a we identified ourselves as a as a developer , as a manufacturer , and as a as a distributor t to other wholesalers . ami_da_4
D 1298.1 And so the th the twenty five Euros that we have identified as the sale price is a wholesale price rather than a retail price . ami_da_4
D 1307.41 That is what we decided here . ami_da_4
D 1309.46 so what I did is I ami_da_4
D 1309.46 I decided that that this this needs to be a product in a in a sense can market itself . ami_da_4
D 1318.34 So what we have identified here as our main marketing stratagem is is in design . ami_da_4
D 1324.62 We are making the most beautiful attractive whatever we decide it is . ami_da_4
D 1329.8 So that means we have about seven more minutes or ten minutes left . ami_da_4
D 1333.88 so I would like to have a product that that we can sell easily . ami_da_4
D 1340.19 So I say inspiration , so having something beauty , something attractive , something that in a sense will sell itself . ami_da_4
D 1347.42 innovation I think fits into what we are talking about here with design . ami_da_4
D 1351.8 cutting edge technology , I do not think we are going to have that , these were ideas I was putting together , unless we come up with some New Age product a as far as the casing is concerned . ami_da_4
D 1364.34 I I want to make this thing something that I can identify as special in some way , ami_da_4
D 1364.34 so maybe we can have some ami_da_3
D 1364.34 I I talked about environmentally sensitive , ami_da_4
D 1364.34 maybe we have a product that can be identified in some way as advantageous in a home . ami_da_6
D 1378.82 I do not know . ami_da_9
D 1380.38 These are just thoughts . ami_da_9
D 1381.71 I wanted to talk about who we are as a as a corporation , ami_da_7
D 1381.71 that we are new , we are aggressive , ami_da_4
D 1381.71 we are competitive , we are we are trying to provide a product from a new perspective rather than from an old corporate line . ami_da_4
D 1395.77 So to me it is about selling d our identity our corporate identity along with the product . ami_da_4
D 1405.99 what I found is that the projected costs are competitive . ami_da_4
D 1411.08 we are kind of in the middle of the market , but what I am seeing is that the market is ready for I ami_da_4
D 1411.08 I identified new technology , but again , because what I see is budget restrictions and limitations ami_da_4
D 1411.08 , I do not know that we can bring any new technology into this thing . ami_da_4
D 1424.7 If if we could have a technological something ami_da_8
D 1424.7 p ami_da_3
D 1424.7 please . ami_da_9
B 1429.37 I have an idea . ami_da_7
B 1431.03 And it is kind of along the s lines of environmentally sensitive , and it may even fit into ergonomics , and even kind of address the issue of losing losing the remote , what we were saying it is a common issue . ami_da_4
B 1443.6 what we can do is , well you know ami_da_4
B 1443.6 that batteries throwing a aw remotes run through batteries like crazy . ami_da_4
A 1449.89 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 1450.3 Right ? ami_da_4
B 1450.3 And s for some people ami_da_3
B 1450.3 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 1451.65 Solar . ami_da_6
B 1453.93 Well maybe not a solar remote ami_da_9
B 1453.93 but instead what about if we had like a power cradle ? ami_da_6
B 1453.93 Like a a cradle that is is there to hold the remote when you are not using it , ami_da_6
B 1453.93 so you will always know where the remote is because you have to put it back there to charge the remote , ami_da_4
B 1453.93 and we can , instead of having instead of having , you know , replaceable batteries we will just have a power cell that stays there for the life of the remote . ami_da_6
D 1455.36 But solar ami_da_6
D 1455.36 , I like it . ami_da_9
B 1474.67 You never have to get go through the go through all these different batteries . ami_da_4
B 1480.27 And also you can ami_da_3
B 1480.27 I I think it is a good opportunity for the user design ami_da_9
B 1480.27 or for not just for the user design , but also for the just for the look and feel of the remote as as a whole . ami_da_4
B 1492.61 You know you could have some kind of neat little , you know , a sexy design for d a cradle and the remote itself . ami_da_6
D 1501.62 I like the idea , ami_da_9
D 1501.62 but we are talking about in cost is going to probably double . ami_da_4
B 1505.28 It w it would increase the cost . ami_da_4
D 1506.65 But boy , we can sell this thing , ami_da_9
D 1506.65 because there is no batteries , it is environmentally sensitive , i we can identify it as a safer product in some form . ami_da_4
B 1513.56 And you could page the remote if you lose it . ami_da_6
B 1515.28 Maybe there is a button on the cradle . ami_da_6
D 1516.56 Yep , that is right . ami_da_9
D 1517.88 I really see ami_da_3
D 1517.88 But the cost ami_da_3
D 1517.88 i ami_da_3
D 1517.88 No no . ami_da_9
A 1518.79 Now the the question is can we make this for less than twelve fifty per ? ami_da_5
A 1518.79 We we well do we necessarily have to change the end cost because Can we dl can we do that without changing it twelve fifty per product , if we basically can sell more based on this ? ami_da_6
D 1522.72 No no , ami_da_9
D 1522.72 we have t we have to change the end cost . ami_da_4
D 1524.67 There is ami_da_4
D 1524.67 I mean I do not see it anyway . ami_da_4
D 1538.76 Yeah , ami_da_9
D 1538.76 that is going to be up to these guys . ami_da_4
D 1540.29 I my reaction is no , but ami_da_4
D 1540.29 Well , see ami_da_6
D 1540.29 I ami_da_6
D 1540.29 I see ami_da_6
D 1540.29 I ami_da_6
D 1540.29 I am an advocate to make this an exclusive product . ami_da_6
B 1540.32 Well ami_da_2
B 1540.32 what I can do is I can d look into ho well Pedro ami_da_7
B 1540.32 and I can look into how much this might increase our our costs ami_da_7
B 1540.32 and you can look into what kind of effect an increased cost is going to have on our on our final numbers . ami_da_6
A 1555.45 Yeah ami_da_9
A 1555.45 we we can certainly push for a more expensive product if that is going to be ami_da_6
A 1555.45 Nah , ami_da_9
A 1555.45 I think we can say with certainty now that we are supporting teletext . ami_da_4
D 1562.55 You know , let is let is sell this wholesale for for fifty Euros , sixty Euros . ami_da_6
D 1567.01 Let is make this thing really exclusive , environmentally sensitive , high tech design , ergonomics , all of this . ami_da_6
D 1574.12 Just make this thing , yeah , the the the Rolls Royce of of remote controls . ami_da_6
B 1579.57 I I ami_da_3
B 1579.57 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 1580.18 Every home is got to have it . ami_da_6
D 1581.34 If you do not have one , ami_da_3
D 1581.34 hey what kind of remote do you have ? ami_da_5
D 1581.34 Oh you have got one of those , ami_da_4
D 1581.34 oh fantastic , ami_da_9
D 1581.34 I want one of those too . ami_da_4
D 1587.25 I just do not have enough money right now . ami_da_4
B 1589.08 I just do not know about that , because in order to do that in order to price it at that kind of level I think we would need to have every functionality that all the other competitors are offering like being able to operate , you know , the DVD player and , you know , the stereo system and all that . ami_da_4
B 1606.37 Which is a pretty basic function that w we have opted out of . ami_da_4
B 1610.1 And additionally we are m maybe not supporting teletext ami_da_4
B 1610.1 But I do think there are some basic features that we do not have that a lot of other remotes are going to have . ami_da_4
D 1624.3 Yep , ami_da_1
D 1624.3 one one thing I do not understand is h they have they have given us this package , okay . ami_da_4
D 1629.54 Now in my opinion we need to give them a package back , okay . ami_da_6
D 1633.37 They say they say okay here you go . ami_da_4
D 1635.22 They gave us a fundament a foundation of of what they want , and and w it is our place to kind of analyse and evaluate . ami_da_4
D 1641.96 I do not think it is our place to create their product for them , maybe it is . ami_da_4
D 1645.48 I do not know what kind of role we have in this in the corporate ladder , ami_da_9
D 1645.48 but to me it is like , ami_da_6
D 1645.48 okay , you have got your here is our ideas , okay . ami_da_6
D 1653.56 And then let them look at those ideas and they say , yeah ami_da_6
D 1653.56 well , we can we can raise the price twenty percent , you know we like this idea , this idea no , ami_da_6
D 1653.56 but to me it is it is about a choice , ami_da_4
D 1653.56 do we follow their directives or do we make presentations back ami_da_6
D 1653.56 and and then and then discuss ? ami_da_6
D 1653.56 beca I ami_da_4
D 1653.56 I do not ami_da_4
D 1653.56 I do not see the market niche for the product that they are handing f handing us right now . ami_da_4
D 1676.55 I do not see it . ami_da_4
B 1676.71 I don I ami_da_3
B 1676.71 I d ami_da_3
B 1676.71 I have to disagree though . ami_da_9
B 1678.97 I think our market niche is basically people who need who have lost their remote or who have broken their remote and do not want to send back to the manufacturer , they just want to run out to the store and get a remote , and then they are going to look on the shelf and they are going to see ours is the nicest looking remote . ami_da_4
B 1695.04 It does what they need . ami_da_4
B 1696.26 These are not I I think that it ami_da_3
B 1696.26 Right . ami_da_1
A 1698.18 And and th to get to back to another point , ami_da_7
A 1698.18 sorry for cutting in but , ami_da_14
A 1698.18 I th ami_da_4
A 1698.18 I think it is important to remember that that this remote has to work with multiple TVs , ami_da_4
A 1698.18 yeah , because it is selling on its own . ami_da_4
A 1707.38 It is not going to be specifically for Hitachi TVs or or whatever . ami_da_4
D 1708.1 Right . ami_da_1
B 1708.98 Right . ami_da_1
D 1710.05 No I understand that . ami_da_12
A 1711.09 So technologically , if I understand it , TVs TV remote is working exactly the same way as video remotes and DVD remotes . ami_da_4
A 1720.31 All you need to do is train them to the individual one , all you need to do is is know the the f like some four digit code . ami_da_4
A 1726.28 So saying that it works with all TVs is equivalent to saying that it will work with DVDs and other things . ami_da_4
D 1731.32 Nope , ami_da_9
D 1731.32 they have identified the product as not working for anything but televisions . ami_da_4
C 1734.77 Yeah y y ami_da_3
C 1734.77 you you would not ami_da_3
C 1734.77 The interface will be different . ami_da_4
D 1734.94 They have identified this product limita That is why I say I do not I do not see the market niche for this . ami_da_4
A 1735.03 Oh okay okay . ami_da_12
A 1735.63 We have done this . ami_da_3
D 1739.91 If we if w if we were going to have a product that worked for DVDs , VCRs and everything , then I can see the market niche , but we we are only identified as going for televisions without teletext . ami_da_4
A 1739.94 I see . ami_da_1
D 1751.18 And it is like whoa ami_da_4
D 1751.18 we ha in my opinion we have to go with something that is extremely exclusive to make this thing marketable , because who wants just a television remote ? ami_da_4
D 1751.18 I do not . ami_da_4
B 1751.37 Right . ami_da_1
B 1755.86 Well here is ami_da_3
B 1755.86 Right . ami_da_1
A 1757.09 And I ami_da_3
A 1757.09 I would ami_da_3
A 1757.09 sorry . ami_da_14
B 1759.56 We he well here is my thing about that . ami_da_7
B 1761.9 If you are in the market for this ultimate remote , you are not going to go for just a television remote . ami_da_4
B 1768.46 If it ca not control if it ca not control your your DVD player and a al ami_da_4
B 1768.46 if y if you ca not get that all in one ultimate remote , that just you can throw all your other remotes away . ami_da_4
D 1768.96 That is right . ami_da_9
B 1779.47 I am not going to buy a d seventy five Euro remote . ami_da_4
D 1783.03 I ami_da_9
D 1783.03 I ami_da_9
D 1783.03 I have a tendency to agree with you . ami_da_9
D 1785.17 I really do . ami_da_4
A 1786.04 So we really ca not chase that . ami_da_9
D 1786.08 That is why I say I quest I ami_da_4
D 1786.08 q I question the marketability of the product . ami_da_4
D 1789.49 I really question where we create the demand . ami_da_4
B 1790.32 So I think what we ami_da_3
B 1790.32 So that is what I am saying ami_da_4
A 1792.04 We are really looking for something basic . ami_da_4
A 1793.79 The the one thing that that that you said really struck a chord with me here in that we are we are carrying the corporate identity with the product , but we are actually looking for a large profit at the same time ami_da_4
A 1793.79 where I would be inclined to go back to upper level management and say like let is just cut down our profit expected on this product because we are actually branding our company here . ami_da_6
A 1811.41 We are selling more than just the product . ami_da_4
A 1813.27 We are trying to get mind share about Real Reaction to to the people who are going to buy consumer electronics . ami_da_4
A 1819.67 We want people to eventually say , oh that is that is Real Reaction that is a good m make . ami_da_4
A 1823.62 It is reliable . ami_da_4
A 1825.36 And and we are going to make it we are going to win mind share by either being a fantastic product or for it working , it just being good , reasonable priced , and solid . ami_da_4
A 1836.65 So if we can make if we can put an emphasis here on it not breaking I think that is in itself an extremely big thing . ami_da_4
B 1841.99 I think that is big . ami_da_9
D 1843.08 W okay ami_da_4
D 1843.08 if you if you drop the cost , now if you make if you make go to the other side of the cost scale , and you make it less expensive , then all of a sudden now we are going into an a a new market area . ami_da_4
D 1853.89 So we can say low cost good design , beautiful , wa da da da da da . ami_da_6
C 1857.88 Good design . ami_da_4
A 1859.31 We only have a few minutes left . ami_da_4
D 1861.21 But what I am saying is right now we are middle market . ami_da_4
A 1864.52 Is twenty five Euros a mid market price for a remote ? ami_da_5
A 1864.52 Okay . ami_da_1
D 1867.46 Yeah for for multi for a multi function remote , that is a mid market price . ami_da_4
B 1867.97 I think so , yeah . ami_da_4
D 1871.22 In a discount right now you can buy them on sale sometimes for about about eighteen , nineteen Euro , and that is for the multi functions , DVD , VCR , catch alls . ami_da_4
A 1878.55 Okay . ami_da_1
D 1883.86 And and they have them in a little box in the middle , and and this is the consciousness that most people have about replacement remote controls . ami_da_4
D 1891.81 So to me , to market this a t only a television remote control we have to change consciousness . ami_da_6
D 1898.05 We have to have something that will change people is thinking to identify this as advantageous , and I do not know what that is . ami_da_4
D 1903.89 It is gotta be low cost or high cost with with special design features . ami_da_4
A 1908.56 Well I would be inclined to say , if we can make the design better than any comparable remote while reducing the cost ami_da_6
A 1908.56 , then that is the way we really should play it . ami_da_6
B 1918.13 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 1918.4 If we can take it down to you know fifteen rather than twenty five and make a low profit margin on it , but we are really doing that to sell the brand . ami_da_6
A 1927.09 Yep we have five minutes left . ami_da_4
A 1929.41 rather th to to to sell for Real Reactions . ami_da_6
D 1929.67 Or my d ami_da_3
D 1929.67 I mean I ami_da_4
D 1929.67 I ami_da_4
D 1929.67 well ami_da_4
D 1929.67 we g ami_da_4
D 1929.67 we are talking about the other end now . ami_da_4
A 1931.95 And I can communicate this to to the more senior people within the company here to to get a reaction . ami_da_7
B 1940.72 What about the idea that I had with the cradle ? ami_da_11
B 1940.72 How do you feel about that ? ami_da_11
B 1940.72 Or how does everybody feel ? ami_da_11
B 1940.72 No , ami_da_9
B 1940.72 but I that is the thing ami_da_4
B 1940.72 I ami_da_4
B 1940.72 I do not think it is necessarily the other end . ami_da_4
A 1947.6 Well how does everybody feel ? ami_da_11
A 1947.6 I ami_da_3
A 1947.6 I think The other the o ami_da_3
A 1947.6 the problem with that in my mind I just think off hand as a as a consumer , would I want to buy that ? ami_da_9
A 1947.6 And I think maybe not because I have got a remote and I will take it to different chairs , I will take it to different ami_da_4
A 1947.6 I ami_da_4
A 1947.6 w ami_da_4
A 1947.6 I do not want to go over somewhere and put it down . ami_da_4
D 1951.6 I like it . ami_da_9
D 1952.11 I like the idea , ami_da_9
D 1952.11 but we have t we have to find out ami_da_3
D 1952.11 Well . ami_da_3
A 1970.7 It i if it is going to be somewhere that you put it down then it needs to be at the side of your armchair , ami_da_6
A 1970.7 and that implies that there is only one TV user . ami_da_4
B 1970.71 Right . ami_da_1
A 1977.9 So it is very good for some people ami_da_9
A 1977.9 but it is not a like ami_da_3
A 1977.9 But it it takes away the ease of use of the remote to a certain extent . ami_da_9
B 1980.28 Well it lasts it would last for several hours on its own power , but when you are done with it you put it back in the cradle . ami_da_4
B 1988.08 Yeah ami_da_9
B 1988.08 well it ami_da_3
A 1988.71 You have to l sort of remember . ami_da_4
A 1990.15 You have to d shift down the side of the couch to find it and put it back and ami_da_4
A 1990.15 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 1996.04 I d ami_da_9
A 1996.04 I d ami_da_9
A 1996.04 I ami_da_9
A 1996.04 d I think it it in my mind ami_da_9
A 1996.04 it does not seem like something that oh I would really want because of that fact . ami_da_9
A 2003.09 But I I do not know , that is just my opinion . ami_da_4
D 2004.56 Well , I think again it is it we have a cost issue here . ami_da_4
D 2007.81 You know if we are going to go in this direction , to me we are going to the other side of the cost range . ami_da_4
D 2011.66 Are we going to make this selling selling the cost as a high high tech environmentally sensitive whatever , or are we going to go to the lower side of the range ? ami_da_8
D 2011.66 Again I do not see our market niche in the middle for our product yet . ami_da_4
D 2026.8 I do not see it yet . ami_da_4
A 2027.0 Okay . ami_da_1
A 2028.52 So what do we think maybe we should ami_da_3
A 2028.52 Pedro , do you have any opinion on it ? ami_da_8
A 2028.52 Really need to wrap up now . ami_da_6
C 2032.88 we should keep it simple , medium low cost mar cost area and make it look good . ami_da_6
D 2041.96 W a question I have in in a ami_da_7
D 2041.96 because I I ami_da_9
D 2041.96 I think I agree with you on ami_da_9
D 2041.96 , we gotta make it a box . ami_da_9
D 2047.83 The box is going to sell it ami_da_4
D 2047.83 I think , the outside , the casing . ami_da_4
D 2050.36 Can can can we have multiple designs ? ami_da_5
D 2050.36 Have a modern , have a traditional , have a you know , and so so instead of them all looking the same , people can have maybe four or five different designs they can choose from . ami_da_6
D 2064.51 I do not know what that creates cost , or ami_da_4
D 2064.51 Yep one over another . ami_da_9
B 2066.53 Well the the problem with that is we may end up with a whole bunch of inventory of a of a poor design you know . ami_da_4
D 2072.66 Yeah , okay , I hear that . ami_da_9
B 2073.81 So ami_da_4
B 2073.81 but what we could do is some kind ami_da_3
B 2073.81 of well ami_da_3
B 2073.81 I mean ami_da_3
B 2073.81 Yeah we we need to , ami_da_6
B 2073.81 I mean , have a few designs to look at and then come up with something that I think we all agree is , you know , the best fit . ami_da_6
C 2074.26 Yeah , complicated but ami_da_9
C 2074.26 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 2094.01 I think w what is really important is it has to look good ami_da_4
B 2094.01 , it has to feel it has to feel good in your hand , it has to be durable , it has to a ami_da_4
B 2094.01 and I think it is really important that it does not look cheap . ami_da_4
A 2099.89 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 2105.82 I think I think we have to make sure people look at it an and feel like it ami_da_4
B 2105.82 its like a quality remote . ami_da_4
B 2113.07 Even though the cost may be low . ami_da_4
D 2113.14 What ab what ab ami_da_3
D 2113.14 what about a a remote that is that does not maybe look like a remote ? ami_da_6
D 2113.14 Just an idea . ami_da_4
D 2124.31 Just just ami_da_3
D 2124.31 okay because I mean we all know what a remote looks like on the outside . ami_da_4
D 2127.91 They are selling these things everywhere . ami_da_4
D 2129.48 Maybe that could be part of our design exclusivity , is we make a remote that does not even look like a remote it it opens like a telephone . ami_da_6
B 2136.21 Or what if it looks like a pen ? ami_da_6
B 2136.21 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 2137.88 Does not matter , yeah . ami_da_9
D 2138.71 I am just jus I talking about some something to make this thing unique . ami_da_4
B 2139.91 A pointer ? ami_da_6
B 2139.91 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 2142.14 It ami_da_3
D 2142.14 That is the thing , I am going to keep thumping on . ami_da_7
D 2144.11 I will sell whatever you guys design . ami_da_7
B 2145.65 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 2145.75 I do not have a problem selling a product , that is not the issue . ami_da_4
D 2148.46 I give you ideas , you guys create the product . ami_da_4
D 2150.83 Once you have the finished product I will find a way to sell it . ami_da_7
D 2153.63 Do not worry about it . ami_da_4
D 2154.38 I just give you these things now , because these are my thoughts and feelings . ami_da_4
C 2157.56 Okay . ami_da_1
B 2157.64 So ami_da_2
B 2157.64 just to touch on m my point one last time that I had brought up . ami_da_6
B 2163.04 I really ami_da_3
B 2163.04 un unless you guys are die hard against the fact that it is possible like it reduces the usability of the remote b and the fact that you ca not lose it on your own , I think it still might be a good idea to investigate having like a power cradle . ami_da_6
A 2180.64 Yeah . ami_da_9
C 2182.69 Okay . ami_da_9
C 2183.11 Yeah . ami_da_9
B 2183.2 Because I really think i in a certain sense it almost like for me ami_da_9
B 2183.2 I would want to have that just , because I know at the end of when I am done watching TV that when I am done , oh I better go find the remote and put it back where it belongs . ami_da_9
B 2195.76 Maybe th th th that is just some people that like that . ami_da_4
A 2198.48 I mean there is al ami_da_4
A 2198.48 there is also remote controls I remember that that worked , this has not been done in a while I think , but th as a as a watch . ami_da_4
B 2198.54 A lot of people ami_da_3
B 2198.54 As a watch ? ami_da_12
B 2198.54 okay . ami_da_1
D 2198.64 No no . ami_da_9
A 2205.92 Yeah , ami_da_9
A 2205.92 there is remote control watches , but I think they are a sorta eighties thing , ami_da_4
A 2205.92 so it might not be easy to market in it ami_da_9
A 2205.92 but the the technologies came along and it might be cheaper to make now . ami_da_4
C 2213.46 Yeah they are not simple . ami_da_9
A 2216.48 Those things may have been inexpensive for all I know . ami_da_4
D 2219.17 One thing I just thought about when you were saying that , is that the p our target market is going to be someone who has lost or broken ami_da_4
D 2219.17 We gotta stop ? ami_da_5
D 2219.17 Who is lost or broken their their remote . ami_da_4
B 2226.66 That is what I was saying . ami_da_4
A 2227.63 Gotta cut up . ami_da_4
D 2230.71 So how many remotes do they want to buy ? ami_da_4
D 2230.71 Can we p can we sell them a remote that can maybe guarantee they will not need to buy another one ? ami_da_6
D 2230.71 And so with with with this kind of system or locator or something , to to think about , how have people been been losing or breaking their remote ? ami_da_6
D 2230.71 How does this happen ? ami_da_6
D 2230.71 And and then and then design the product , maybe some component of the product that can identify this as the last one you will ever need to buy . ami_da_6
B 2237.94 Exactly . ami_da_9
C 2240.31 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 2249.61 The last remote you will ever buy . ami_da_4
B 2249.75 And also presumably they have ami_da_3
B 2249.75 Exactly . ami_da_1
A 2258.72 Well if if we are going down that then we can we do not need to go the ami_da_3
A 2258.72 it it strikes me that the locator feature might actually be quite expensive to make . ami_da_9
B 2264.39 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 2266.81 Whereas actually just putting it in a power cradle might not be too expensive at all ami_da_9
A 2266.81 because that is just done with mobile phones ami_da_4
A 2266.81 you can just ami_da_6
A 2266.81 n ami_da_6
A 2266.81 we we have said we have actually similar products that we can take from and potentially cut costs there . ami_da_6
B 2270.25 True . ami_da_1
B 2271.81 Right . ami_da_1
B 2273.06 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 2273.62 The locator will definitely be more expensive . ami_da_4
A 2278.35 need to look into whether we can do that ami_da_6
A 2278.35 but I think we we have some m mobile phone based products ami_da_4
A 2278.35 checking quickly our Internet . ami_da_7
A 2287.34 We really need to finish up here . ami_da_4
D 2289.4 we can make it in the shape of a coffee pot . ami_da_6
A 2289.43 But Yeah we have the the power adaptor products . ami_da_4
A 2295.75 We sell power adaptor products . ami_da_4
A 2297.1 So for example there is nothing stopping us using that technology . ami_da_4
D 2298.63 It is just it is that I think it is telling us to stop our meeting . ami_da_4
A 2301.68 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 2302.43 So we have the c we probably have have on line in our in our system , we have the ability to create this , we are talking about . ami_da_4
A 2309.32 Yeah I think so , ami_da_9
A 2309.32 without it being too ami_da_3
A 2309.32 In fact we can cut costs through using the manufacturing that is already going to be in place here . ami_da_4
D 2309.64 A charging system . ami_da_4
B 2314.92 Right . ami_da_1
D 2315.15 If if we can create this we have probably five or six or seven really strong marketing characteristics . ami_da_4
B 2319.52 Right . ami_da_1
B 2320.17 I think one of the things that we can put right on the box is , never buy another battery . ami_da_6
A 2320.56 Okay . ami_da_2
A 2324.68 Yep . ami_da_1
A 2326.98 Okay . ami_da_14
