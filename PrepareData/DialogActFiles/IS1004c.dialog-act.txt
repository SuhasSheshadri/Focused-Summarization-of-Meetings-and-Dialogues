B 43.58 , yes , I had something similar but non vegetarian . ami_da_4
A 51.08 So today is our third meeting . ami_da_4
A 55.61 It will be about the conceptual design . ami_da_4
A 60.47 If I come back to the minutes of the last meetings ami_da_7
A 65.7 We decided not to go for speech recognition technologies because of some reasons and we are not decided about u the use of LCD screen on on the remote control because of costs . ami_da_4
A 77.51 So maybe we cou wi will be able to clarify this this question to today . ami_da_6
A 83.11 at the end of the meeting we should take decision on that point . ami_da_6
A 88.09 So I hope that your respective pr presentations will help us . ami_da_4
A 93.53 So each of you have some presentatio presentation to perform ami_da_4
A 93.53 who starts ? ami_da_8

D 134.39 I investigate deeper the preference of the users . ami_da_4
D 140.96 so the the current investigation th th ami_da_2
D 140.96 sorry ami_da_14
D 140.96 the current the ami_da_2
D 140.96 n ami_da_2
D 140.96 current trends ? ami_da_5
D 140.96 Yeah ? ami_da_11
D 140.96 Okay . ami_da_9
B 152.47 Yeah . ami_da_4
D 155.73 Okay . ami_da_2
D 158.96 Well wha what I found ami_da_3
D 158.96 can you ami_da_6
D 158.96 Yeah . ami_da_4
A 163.65 Next slide ? ami_da_5
A 163.65 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 165.16 Thank you . ami_da_14
D 166.28 What I found in order of importance from less to more important is that people want an easy to use device . ami_da_4
D 176.74 After they they want something new technologic technologically speaking , ami_da_4
D 176.74 but the most ami_da_2
D 176.74 what they what they find more more interesting , more or more important it is a fancy look and feel instead of instead of the current the current trend which was f the functional look and feel . ami_da_4
D 203.64 So now more more cool aspect , ma more a cooler aspect rather than a device with many functions and many buttons with instead of i instead of ha of a device which can do many things , a device which is pleasant to to watch , to see . ami_da_4
A 228.08 Okay . ami_da_1
D 229.06 also Well in in Euro in in Paris and and Milan the ami_da_2
D 229.06 in Paris and in Paris and Milan the the current trend of of clothes , furniture and all this all this fashion it is it is fruit and the the the theme is fruit and vegetables . ami_da_4
D 258.69 And also in the in the USA the the current the mor the most popular feeling it is it is a spongy . ami_da_4
D 269.68 Spongy means eponge ? ami_da_4
D 269.68 So maybe we should we should think in in this direction , so ami_da_6
D 269.68 Fruit vegetables is the the new ami_da_3
D 269.68 have you seen the last exposition of clothes in Milan ? ami_da_5
D 269.68 Yeah , I I did not miss an ami_da_2
D 269.68 I did not miss and I saw that the fruit , there are many fr pictures of fruits and vegetables in the clothes . ami_da_4
B 277.4 What what do you mean by fruit and vegetables and spongy ? ami_da_5
B 277.4 What you mean clothe ami_da_5
B 277.4 No , I missed that one . ami_da_4
C 282.17 Spongy means it it is like sp ami_da_3
C 282.17 But what is your suggestion how we can have some shape like that on the remote ? ami_da_8
B 300.76 Oh , they are okay ami_da_12
B 300.76 so they are not like dressed as a carrot they just have like pictures of fruit on , okay . ami_da_12
D 303.67 No no , not not yet , not yet . ami_da_4
D 306.35 Yeah , ami_da_4
D 306.35 yeah . ami_da_4
B 307.98 So we are not going to have a remote control in the shape of of a banana , ami_da_9
B 307.98 just maybe Okay and ami_da_3
B 307.98 So which fruit are you thinking of ? ami_da_8
B 307.98 Oh , so you want the remote control to be the shape of a fruit , or you want just some kind of like fruit logo on the ami_da_8
B 307.98 So something that looks half like a fruit and half like an elephant . ami_da_14
D 308.09 So te textu textures , yeah . ami_da_4
D 311.56 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 313.0 Vegetable textures and all this kind . ami_da_4
A 315.8 Drawings of bananas . ami_da_4
D 318.54 yeah , ami_da_2
D 318.54 yeah . ami_da_2
A 320.5 Uh huh . ami_da_16
A 326.64 Well so this is in the next slide certainly . ami_da_4
D 328.71 no no , it is not . ami_da_4
A 329.78 It is not ? ami_da_12
A 329.78 So maybe you maybe you can display a banana on the LCD . ami_da_6
D 330.53 It is ami_da_3
D 330.53 And . ami_da_2
D 341.42 I ha I have not thought of any particular fruit , ami_da_4
D 341.42 but the general aspect of the of the remote control may may could remind some kind of vegetable , ami_da_6
D 341.42 some kind of ami_da_2
D 341.42 instead of vegetable , some natur natural object or something . ami_da_6
D 363.26 But yeah it it depends on the ami_da_3
D 363.26 Yeah maybe the shape the shape ami_da_9
D 363.26 No , not n not not too much focus , not too much focu not n not too s not too similar to a fruit because next year the ten the trend the trend will be different . ami_da_9
C 377.22 Means buttons are in the shape of fruits , buttons are in the frape shape of fruits or something , apple , banana , something like that . ami_da_6
A 386.6 Apple for channel one . ami_da_14
D 396.87 So we should not be at re really attached to to the trend ami_da_6
D 396.87 but ami_da_3
D 396.87 For instance , yeah . ami_da_14
D 407.39 African or as an elephant ? ami_da_14
D 407.39 Well ma maybe we we should further specify what target are we focusing . ami_da_6
C 409.11 That we can discuss afterwards . ami_da_14
B 410.35 But okay , ami_da_2
B 410.35 I am not , I am not really sure if that would really appeal to everyone though , maybe just to fashion gurus , ami_da_9
B 410.35 like maybe just like a little bit n a little fruit picture somewhere in the corner , ami_da_6
B 410.35 but I do not know about ami_da_2
B 410.35 I dunno how ergonomic a , an orange is . ami_da_9
A 411.48 Okay . ami_da_1
D 433.99 I think in my opinion we should focus on on young people ami_da_6
D 433.99 because they are more open to new devi new devices and also ami_da_4
D 433.99 yeah ami_da_4
D 433.99 according to the marketing report ninety p ninety five percent of young people was was was able to to buy a a n a cooler remote control . ami_da_4
B 440.82 To fruit ? ami_da_5
B 440.82 But is it is fruit cool ? ami_da_11
B 440.82 Is fruit cool ? ami_da_11
B 440.82 Well I guess , you know , Apple has the iPod so , ami_da_9
B 440.82 imagi ami_da_3
B 440.82 just because they have an apple on their on their product , does not mean fruit is cool . ami_da_9
D 463.28 What ? ami_da_12
D 463.28 What ? ami_da_12
D 463.28 Yeah ? ami_da_12
D 463.28 Is the new trend ami_da_4
D 463.28 of the ami_da_3
D 463.28 No I think we we should think about a a shape with it ami_da_6
D 463.28 a device with a shape of some ami_da_3
D 463.28 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 463.92 That is a question . ami_da_4
B 495.62 Okay , but it has to be easy to to use though and to hold you know , you do not want to pear or a watermelon . ami_da_9
D 505.9 Don do not you think we can find the shape of a fruit which is handy to use ? ami_da_11
D 505.9 Or m ami_da_3
D 505.9 Maybe . ami_da_9
B 510.08 Well , probably the only thing is a banana that I can think of , a cucumber . ami_da_4
C 512.04 Banana . ami_da_1
B 515.58 I dunno . ami_da_4
A 515.89 Maybe too long . ami_da_9
B 518.16 Maybe . ami_da_9
B 519.06 Too green . ami_da_9
B 522.4 So , but I mean you also have to you have to also have , fit r all the buttons ami_da_4
B 522.4 and you know . ami_da_4
A 522.91 A banana . ami_da_6
D 524.95 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 529.14 It is , it ami_da_3
B 529.14 The thing is you have t normally with with buttons , they have to be at some point attached to a circuit board ami_da_4
B 529.14 so if you are going to have things like on a cylindrical kind of device it may be difficult to kind of to build . ami_da_9
C 543.78 I do not th ami_da_3
C 543.78 it will be rolling a lot . ami_da_9
D 544.36 Yeah ami_da_9
D 544.36 but I li ami_da_9
D 544.36 I like your idea that we should not have a lot of buttons b buttons so ami_da_9
D 544.36 do you want a an LCD with twenty five Euros ? ami_da_11
D 544.36 I think ami_da_3
D 544.36 Well , according to the to the report people are more interested in in a fa fancy look and feel and in a technological inno in innovation , ami_da_4
D 544.36 so , I will give more importance to the look and feel than rather than the new inputs and also it is I am not convinced about this LCD ami_da_9
D 544.36 because you need internet connection , you need more things , it is not just buying a new control ami_da_4
D 544.36 re remote , you need buying control remote , buying more things . ami_da_4
A 545.84 Okay . ami_da_1
A 550.15 Yeah ami_da_9
A 550.15 and you you you will not have pla enough a lot of place to put a LCD on a banana also . ami_da_4
B 556.93 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 561.11 Well , you are the Marketing Expert ami_da_11
A 561.11 you should tell us if it is too much or not . ami_da_11
B 561.2 Well , this is ami_da_3
B 561.2 Okay . ami_da_9
A 579.68 So So you you you suggest to go f ami_da_3
A 579.68 Okay . ami_da_1
A 600.69 S ami_da_2
A 600.69 so you are simply ami_da_2
A 600.69 you are simply looking s to a remote control that looks like a banana with few buttons with only a few buttons . ami_da_9
D 601.19 It is not so simple . ami_da_9
D 607.21 For instance , yeah . ami_da_9
D 608.68 Yeah for for for given an an example ami_da_9
D 608.68 yeah . ami_da_9
A 611.57 Okay good . ami_da_9
A 612.58 So maybe you can go ahead ? ami_da_6
A 612.58 Okay . ami_da_9
D 614.6 Yeah no , it is what I already said . ami_da_4
A 619.04 Thanks . ami_da_14
A 622.96 Okay , I will give the floor . ami_da_7
A 625.41 So you are User Interface guy . ami_da_6
A 628.21 So you are three ? ami_da_5
A 628.21 And it is this one . ami_da_5
B 629.64 Yeah . ami_da_4
B 633.22 Yep . ami_da_4
A 636.34 Go for it . ami_da_6
B 638.11 Yep . ami_da_9
B 638.44 Okay . ami_da_2
B 638.76 So . ami_da_2
B 640.31 S next slide . ami_da_4
B 642.7 Okay . ami_da_4
B 643.07 So I received an email around lunchtime letting me know that the brilliant minds at our technology division had developed an integrated programmable sample sensor sample speaker unit , which is a way for you to have a conversation with your coffee machine and or remote control . ami_da_4
C 662.18 But it is just a speaker right ? ami_da_5
C 662.18 It is not a microphone . ami_da_4
B 663.84 It is ami_da_2
B 663.84 no , what it is , it is it is very ami_da_4
B 663.84 It has a has a microphone , has a speaker , it is got a little chip ami_da_4
B 663.84 and it allows you t ami_da_3
B 663.84 Well , it is a sample sensor sample speaker . ami_da_4
C 671.96 Actually I am not reading microphone there , ami_da_4
C 671.96 so that is why you can all have conversation , it just to speak to you . ami_da_4
B 679.72 Sample sensor sample speaker . ami_da_4
B 681.52 It means that it can recognize , it can do like a match on a on a certain phrase that you speak and then can play back a phrase in response to that . ami_da_4
B 690.89 But there is no kind of understanding of the phrase . ami_da_4
C 695.73 Okay . ami_da_1
B 696.07 So , I mean , you know , ami_da_2
B 696.07 I guess you could build that in , you could you could link the the recognition of a certain phrase to some function on on the remote control . ami_da_6
B 703.75 But basically the thing is , we have this technology available in house . ami_da_4
C 707.41 In house . ami_da_5
B 709.0 So , ami_da_2
B 709.0 but the thing is obviously there is still going to be a cost if you decided to integrate that because you still have to pay for the c production of the components , ami_da_4
B 709.0 so it ami_da_2
B 709.0 it ami_da_2
B 709.0 but it basically means we c ami_da_6
B 709.0 we can kind of consider this from you know a theoretical or usability kind of viewpoint without worrying too much about you know how to develop it because we have this already done . ami_da_6
B 731.98 Whilst you know , some people might get annoyed if we if we just dump it , ami_da_4
B 731.98 It is it it is no , well , ami_da_2
B 731.98 it is it will recognize ami_da_4
B 731.98 I guess keywords , but you know keywords in a certain order like a phrase . ami_da_4
A 735.55 I ami_da_2
A 735.55 there is something that I unclear really understanding . ami_da_4
A 741.52 Is this a technology that recognize keywords speech keywords ? ami_da_5
A 741.52 And it is just to , it is just to playback something ? ami_da_5
A 741.52 Yeah yeah . ami_da_9
B 752.69 You train it for a certain , for a certain phrase , ami_da_4
B 752.69 you say ami_da_2
B 752.69 the the example they said that they have up and running with their prototype is well they have actually integrated into the into the the coffee machine that that we are producing is , you can say good morning to the coffee machine and it can recognize that phrase and it will playback good morning , how would you like your coffee ? ami_da_4
B 752.69 Yeah . ami_da_4
B 777.35 So actually that was a bad example , ami_da_9
B 777.35 because it does not actually ask how do you want your coffee because it ca not really understand the response , so . ami_da_4
A 782.01 So this is not s really to do to to do control . ami_da_5
B 787.87 Only , like , only in the sense that it it can recognize a set a set target kind of word an ami_da_4
B 787.87 It is designed it is designed as a fun kind of thing , ami_da_4
B 787.87 but I guess you could use it as as a way to implement ami_da_3
B 787.87 Completely pointless yeah . ami_da_9
A 792.23 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 793.15 This is just more like a poi pois ami_da_9
A 793.15 yeah . ami_da_9
A 797.74 Yeah yeah . ami_da_1
A 802.25 So it it is c it it ami_da_2
A 802.25 it is a easy a fancy thing that you you can bring to we can bring to the remote control that will not have any ami_da_9
A 802.25 yeah ami_da_9
A 802.25 comp completely pointless for the inter for from the interaction point of v point of view . ami_da_9
D 802.28 Yeah but you can u ami_da_3
D 802.28 Yeah but the can we use it for saying okay , channel fifty , channel twenty ? ami_da_5
D 802.28 M Mando . ami_da_4
B 816.3 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 819.92 Yeah , unless you know , you like having conversation with your remote control . ami_da_9
A 823.59 Okay . ami_da_1
B 827.75 Well yeah , that is the thing , ami_da_9
B 827.75 if ami_da_2
B 827.75 you can but you have to pro though I think it is a fairly simple design ami_da_4
B 827.75 so you would have to record into the device every possible combination , you have to s ami_da_4
B 827.75 tr train it to l to learn channel fifteen ami_da_4
B 827.75 , that whole thing , not just the word channel and the word fifteen , it does not have that kind of logic in it . ami_da_4
A 844.02 Yeah yeah . ami_da_1
A 845.19 So this is so this is this is much more than tak taking this technology , bringing it to the remote control and using it . ami_da_9
B 846.65 So ami_da_2
B 846.65 Yeah , that would be some development work . ami_da_9
A 853.03 So this is out of discussion . ami_da_9
B 856.2 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 856.58 So if if if it is something that you can we can bring easily and to put it into the banana remote control ami_da_9
A 856.58 No this is banana bando , ami_da_9
A 856.58 yeah . ami_da_9
B 865.09 Banana mando . ami_da_6
D 866.27 Banana mando ami_da_9
D 866.27 yeah . ami_da_9
B 866.28 Banana man ami_da_14
B 866.28 I ami_da_9
B 866.28 I ami_da_9
B 866.28 I ami_da_9
B 866.28 I do not think it is worth it though ami_da_9
B 866.28 , I think it does not really add much to the functional design ami_da_9
B 866.28 and it is it is it is not mature enough to use as a speech recognition engine , ami_da_9
B 866.28 so ami_da_9
B 866.28 , yeah . ami_da_2
A 868.04 then it could be cool ami_da_9
A 868.04 yeah . ami_da_9
C 874.51 Yeah okay , ami_da_9
C 874.51 let is go ahead . ami_da_6
A 876.27 Okay . ami_da_9
A 887.99 Okay . ami_da_1
B 891.51 So if we can just move on to the next slide , ami_da_6
B 891.51 I have just done a quick mock up of some of the features of our potential funky looking remote control ami_da_4
B 891.51 Well , you see , I was ami_da_4
B 891.51 I was unaware at this point of th of the fruit focus , ami_da_4
B 891.51 , so at the moment it is more of a box focus . ami_da_9
A 900.66 It does not look like a banana at all . ami_da_9
A 906.58 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 908.38 But you you can fit i ami_da_3
A 908.38 you are saying now you can fit it to ami_da_3
A 908.38 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 908.76 Looks like a tr look likes a a tro a tropical fruit . ami_da_9
D 913.25 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 914.06 Yeah , well , this is actu this could be a genetically engineered fruit that is designed to be you know square so that it packs tighter in the boxes . ami_da_14
B 921.43 But , I have just indicated here , we could have actually two scroll wheels , ami_da_6
B 921.43 because I think the scroll wheel is a fairly key part of , you know , ami_da_9
B 921.43 I think everyone has has agreed that it is that it could be quite a useful thing , so . ami_da_4
C 928.0 Stable thing , that is right . ami_da_9
C 930.37 To have , ami_da_9
B 935.54 But I think it is important , you know , to have two scroll wheels because , you know , you want one for for the channel , but you also want one for for the volume , because it is it is the volume ami_da_9
B 935.54 i it is , you know it is very handy for it to have instant kind of feedback and response , so . ami_da_9
B 951.08 But , ami_da_2
B 951.08 I have also included this turbo button ami_da_4
B 951.08 because I think , you know , every design should have a turbo button , ami_da_9
B 951.08 and well ami_da_2
B 951.08 so this is you know , a unique problem with with televisions is that if you have this scro this scroll wheel for the television , the the tuner on the TV is not going to be able to to switch between stations as fast as you can scroll , so you know , the th the person might want to have a Might want to be able to scroll past television stations without seeing what is on them , in which case it just waits until you stop scrolling and then , you know , displays that station . ami_da_4
D 957.01 What is a turbo button ? ami_da_5
D 957.01 It con it controls the speed ? ami_da_5
D 957.01 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 986.17 Or they might want to scroll and and have a quick glimpse of it , even if it lags behind what they are doing . ami_da_4
B 993.94 Yeah , so with this turbo button you can , say , skip over t channels if , you know , if I am if I am going if I am scrolling past them ami_da_4
B 993.94 and you know , it is , you could have a little red light that comes up when they press it ami_da_6
B 993.94 so they feel ami_da_6
B 993.94 you know it is really going fast or whatever . ami_da_6
B 1011.57 So yeah , that is , ami_da_2
B 1011.57 those are the two important features I think we need on the remote , ami_da_9
B 1011.57 but I mean we can discuss about what other kind of buttons we need , . ami_da_6
B 1022.89 You know , i it could be , you know , if we if we want to have like a very cheap kind of device , ami_da_6
B 1022.89 I mean , we could either consider that maybe we want to sell this as a very , if it is going to be a banana ami_da_4
B 1022.89 , you know that is a pretty gimmicky kind of thing that does not have that much functionality , it is just you know a couple of scroll wheels and a button ami_da_4
B 1022.89 cause it is hard to get so many buttons on a banana ami_da_4
B 1022.89 and it is still very ami_da_2
B 1022.89 it may even be for most for some people more functional than their current remote , but if they have these scroll wheels , ami_da_9
B 1022.89 so , you know , what other buttons do we want ? ami_da_11
B 1022.89 I mean we could have ami_da_2
B 1022.89 well , I guess you need an on and off switch , ami_da_4
B 1022.89 but you could you could o you could turn it turn it on by taking the top off the banana maybe , you know , ami_da_6
B 1022.89 it is kind of like a spy kind of flick thing . ami_da_9
A 1042.32 It is enough . ami_da_9
A 1058.04 Switch on . ami_da_9
A 1058.65 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 1065.42 So sounds crazy . ami_da_9
D 1067.34 I like crazy ideas . ami_da_9
B 1069.93 That is why you are a marketing guru . ami_da_9
A 1070.63 Okay . ami_da_2
D 1070.9 Yeah , of course . ami_da_9
A 1071.5 So i it looks like we are going completely to forget about the LCD thing . ami_da_9
B 1077.9 Well , that is the thing , ami_da_9
B 1077.9 as ami_da_3
B 1077.9 have we decided that we can only spend , , twenty five Euro ? ami_da_5
B 1077.9 Well not spend , but you know , charge twenty five Euro . ami_da_4
A 1083.7 I think that ami_da_3
A 1083.7 No we can we ca not use that . ami_da_9
D 1087.31 I I think we could use somehow the s coffee machine dialogue interface or so . ami_da_6
D 1099.73 You ami_da_2
D 1099.73 we can ? ami_da_12
D 1099.73 We ca not . ami_da_12
A 1100.97 We ca not use that to to comman co communicate , ami_da_4
A 1100.97 it is just a thing ami_da_3
A 1100.97 No . ami_da_4
C 1103.48 Communicate . ami_da_4
D 1105.78 Yeah , but we can say channel twenty five . ami_da_4
C 1106.46 It is one way . ami_da_4
D 1108.6 No ? ami_da_12
D 1108.6 It is not a lot one hundred templates , ami_da_9
D 1108.6 it is not ami_da_3
D 1108.6 , it is designed for a cof okay . ami_da_9
B 1109.11 But then you have to have a template for every channel , for a hundred channels , ami_da_4
B 1109.11 you have to be able to to recognize ami_da_3
B 1116.29 Well , I f I think it is probably more than , than our can handle because it is designed for a coffee machine , you know , to say hello in the morning . ami_da_9
A 1120.08 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 1125.71 Is it design for a coffee machine ? ami_da_5
D 1125.71 Okay . ami_da_1
B 1127.16 Well that is its current application , I would presume that it is kind of , they would not design it to handle a hundred things th so . ami_da_4
D 1132.66 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 1133.83 Maybe you could ask your the ami_da_2
D 1133.83 you could ask the engineering department if we can ami_da_6
D 1133.83 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 1138.09 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 1138.66 A good good good thing . ami_da_9
B 1139.51 But ami_da_3
B 1139.51 Well I just I just made the point , ami_da_4
B 1139.51 I do not I do not know if that speech recognition is , you know , even if we can do it ami_da_9
B 1139.51 , I think it is not really appropriate for television environment . ami_da_9
A 1139.85 You want to g to move to your slides ? ami_da_8
A 1139.85 You are finished ? ami_da_5
A 1139.85 Yeah I think so . ami_da_9
C 1140.69 Yeah , that is right , yeah . ami_da_9
B 1152.13 But I did have one thing from a previous meeting , you were talking about being able to find the remote control and I was talking about extendin being able to extend the remote control by having you know , a base station that can control other things as well . ami_da_4
B 1165.79 It might be useful to have some kind of base station , even if it is just you press on a button on it and and the remote control starts beeping , you know , this is a way of finding the remote . ami_da_6
B 1176.73 Y in that case maybe the maybe the speech recognition the speech thing could be useful just to say I am here ami_da_9
B 1176.73 but it is probably a bit of overkill if you could just have a a beeping ami_da_9
B 1176.73 It is speech ami_da_2
B 1176.73 It is it is speech synthesis and s ami_da_4
B 1176.73 it is speech kind of , not really speech recognition , but kind of pattern matching , ami_da_4
B 1176.73 yeah ami_da_4
B 1176.73 yeah . ami_da_9
A 1181.02 Exactly yeah . ami_da_1
C 1186.51 So it is a speech synthesis kind of thing , ami_da_5
C 1186.51 something has been stored and it is just spoken out . ami_da_4
C 1195.29 Yeah . ami_da_9
C 1196.23 That is right . ami_da_9
A 1196.88 Oh , good idea . ami_da_9
A 1198.37 Very good . ami_da_9
A 1199.53 Okay , let is move on . ami_da_6
A 1203.17 So you are two ? ami_da_5
A 1203.17 Okay . ami_da_9
C 1204.16 That is right . ami_da_4
C 1209.25 So this is going to be about the component design . ami_da_4
C 1212.61 So first thing is we need power source for the remote control . ami_da_4
C 1215.92 So I was of the idea that we can have two kind of power supplies , one is the usual batteries which are there , ami_da_6
C 1215.92 they could be chargeable batteries if there is a basis station kind of thing ami_da_4
C 1215.92 and on top of that we can have solar cells , ami_da_6
C 1215.92 when the lighting conditions are good they can be used so it will be pretty innovative kind . ami_da_4
C 1235.05 Then we need plastic with some elasticity so that if your if the remote control falls it is not broken directly into pieces , there should be some flexibility in t ami_da_6
C 1235.05 Yeah . ami_da_9
B 1244.79 I guess that fits in with the spongy kind of design philosophy . ami_da_9
A 1247.96 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 1249.97 So there should ami_da_2
C 1249.97 we should think of something like that ami_da_6
C 1249.97 and then it should be double curve . ami_da_6
C 1256.39 The s science for the ease of handling and there are some other issues why we need double curve . ami_da_4
C 1263.17 Then controls ami_da_4
C 1263.17 for the traditionals u traditional users we can have the push buttons so that they do not feel that it is an alien thing for them . ami_da_6
B 1271.14 So , just one second , ami_da_16
B 1271.14 when you say double curve , what do you actually mean ? ami_da_5
B 1271.14 You reckon you could like draw us a thing on the , on the whiteboard ami_da_6
B 1271.14 because I am not sure ami_da_4
B 1271.14 Okay , ami_da_9
B 1271.14 but like , kind of convex or concave ? ami_da_5
C 1278.58 Double curve is , you have curves on both the sides if I am right . ami_da_4
C 1283.83 So it is symmetrical kind of thing , whatever it is . ami_da_4
C 1287.24 So , it could be curve , so it could be convex , conve concave , depending on what what we want . ami_da_4
B 1293.35 Okay . ami_da_9
C 1294.72 So there are flats , there are single curve and there are double curves . ami_da_4
B 1297.89 Okay . ami_da_1
C 1298.09 These are the three things , and there are different materials , with plastic you can have double curve but with certain other materials we cannot have double curve . ami_da_4
C 1306.01 So there there was there were many other materials like wood , titanium and all those things , ami_da_4
C 1306.01 but plastic is I think is the most appropriate one , ami_da_9
C 1306.01 it will bring the cost down ami_da_4
C 1306.01 and anyway it is Wooden cases ami_da_3
A 1313.9 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 1316.08 Although , you know , wood could be quite a stylish option , ami_da_9
B 1316.08 if you take like , nice quality kind of wood that is got a nice grain ami_da_6
B 1316.08 and you kind of put some , some varnish on . ami_da_6
A 1326.78 but i ami_da_2
A 1326.78 but there is no elasticity ami_da_4
A 1326.78 which could be ami_da_3
A 1326.78 Yeah but the components inside . ami_da_9
B 1332.21 Well it depends , ami_da_9
B 1332.21 I mean , you have the outs the wood itself is not going to break ami_da_4
B 1332.21 so you do not have to worry too much about the case being broken , ami_da_9
B 1332.21 it is the inside . ami_da_4
B 1338.79 Yeah ami_da_6
B 1338.79 but inside you know you could have you can still have some kind of cushioning that is not visible to the to the user . ami_da_6
A 1342.43 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 1344.61 Very too expensive to do . ami_da_9
D 1346.9 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 1348.2 And I mean you could also , you can have just a very thin veneer of wood as well . ami_da_6
A 1348.56 And also ami_da_3
A 1348.56 Yeah but it is more easier to do a banana in plastic than in wood . ami_da_9
B 1357.0 That is true , ami_da_9
B 1357.0 but are we set on the banana idea ? ami_da_11
B 1357.0 It is like a pumpkin or ami_da_5
B 1357.0 Green . ami_da_12
D 1362.25 Actually I was thinking that the the shape of a banana is not it is not really handy . ami_da_9
A 1362.39 Well it look like ami_da_2
A 1362.39 it looks like you are all targeting that ami_da_9
A 1362.39 yeah ? ami_da_11
A 1362.39 Yes it is . ami_da_9
D 1374.04 I do not know the name o o in English ami_da_4
D 1374.04 This ami_da_2
D 1374.04 it is not a fruit it is a vegetable . ami_da_4
C 1383.77 Is it an e apple which has ami_da_5
C 1383.77 Banana is more handier as compared to this I think , and to capsicum . ami_da_9
A 1388.06 Yeah ? ami_da_5
A 1388.06 Pumpkin . ami_da_5
D 1390.24 Green . ami_da_4
A 1391.48 Green . ami_da_12
A 1391.95 , yes I see . ami_da_9
B 1396.45 What does it taste like ? ami_da_5
B 1396.45 yeah , ami_da_9
B 1396.45 is it ami_da_2
B 1396.45 what is it in French ? ami_da_5
B 1396.45 Yeah , okay , so capsicum or pepper . ami_da_9
D 1396.77 And you put in the salad . ami_da_4
A 1398.4 Pep pepperoni . ami_da_5
D 1400.05 Oui c'est ca ami_da_9
D 1400.05 Pepper . ami_da_12
A 1402.6 Poivron . ami_da_4
A 1407.3 pepper . ami_da_12
B 1407.54 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 1409.71 But they do d ami_da_3
A 1409.71 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 1411.25 And it is al it also suits with the double curve for easy of No , ami_da_9
D 1411.25 I mean in a ami_da_3
D 1411.25 I am sure it is fun . ami_da_9
B 1417.17 I do not know , it seems a little bit kind of bulky to me , like ami_da_9
B 1417.17 like with a banana you can have ami_da_3
B 1417.17 Well ami_da_3
B 1417.17 But like a banana you can you can be holding like this and have the scroll wheel kind of on top and just roll it back and forth like that , ami_da_4
B 1417.17 but with ami_da_2
B 1417.17 I do not know how you would hold a capsicum and ami_da_4
B 1417.17 So is that , when you say speaker support , you mean it just has some output pinned which which which kind of ami_da_5
B 1417.17 Okay , ami_da_9
B 1417.17 but the speaker is actually attached to the to the chip in some way , or is just the the signal ? ami_da_5
B 1417.17 Okay . ami_da_9
A 1420.26 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 1421.43 It is not re it ami_da_2
A 1421.43 you you think it is really fancy and fun ? ami_da_11
A 1421.43 You think that young people that are ami_da_3
A 1421.43 Yeah . ami_da_11
A 1429.23 More than a banana ? ami_da_11
A 1429.23 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 1431.06 But banana is not so handy , I think that is handier . ami_da_9
A 1445.58 It is kind it is kind of it is more ami_da_2
A 1445.58 it is really ergonomic , it is fit in the hand and you have a lot of surface to to put the controls . ami_da_9
A 1458.79 Okay let is move on . ami_da_6
D 1459.52 Yeah you are right . ami_da_9
A 1460.42 So time is running , ami_da_4
A 1460.42 let is move on . ami_da_6
C 1461.7 Okay , so push buttons for the traditional users so that they do not feel they are alienated , ami_da_4
C 1461.7 just ami_da_3
C 1461.7 and a scroll button with push technology for channel selection , volume control and teletext browsing . ami_da_4
C 1472.32 These are the three scroll buttons which are already available with us in the company ami_da_4
C 1472.32 and we we can go ahead with that . ami_da_6
A 1478.5 Okay . ami_da_1
C 1478.89 Yeah , we can go to the next slide . ami_da_6
C 1481.07 Then there are different kind of chips , one one is the basic chip and the regular chip and one an adva advanced chip . ami_da_4
C 1488.57 So we can have regular chip for control . ami_da_6
C 1490.34 Pricing is a factor for us , that is why we will go for the regular chip . ami_da_9
C 1494.17 And regular chip supports speaker support , ami_da_4
C 1494.17 so this functionality could be used for tracing the mobile phone which has been misplaced . ami_da_6
C 1507.04 It could be a beep kind of thing . ami_da_4
C 1513.08 Yes , yes , that is right , it is it is onto the chip , most most probably , not not hundred per cent sure about that . ami_da_4
B 1519.34 Okay . ami_da_1
B 1520.8 So are there any issues where we place this this chip to make sure you can actually hear the the speaker from the outside of the banana ? ami_da_5
B 1520.8 Okay . ami_da_1
C 1529.12 That will be the volume control I think which which a user shou it ami_da_4
C 1529.12 it should be already pre defined . ami_da_4
C 1535.73 It should be whatever will be the case , the chip is always going to be sitting inside . ami_da_4
B 1539.8 Yeah , but the speaker , if the speaker is actually on the chip , then if it is too far away from the the casing , or if the casing is too thick , then you may not hear the the speaker . ami_da_4
C 1548.68 , so we can have it at one of the boundaries so that things are slightly better . ami_da_6
B 1553.91 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 1554.06 As ami_da_2
C 1554.06 or as hearing is concerned , we can have some gap at some place , ami_da_6
C 1554.06 so that ami_da_3
C 1554.06 That is right . ami_da_9
B 1558.32 Yeah . ami_da_9
B 1558.73 So that is something we have to keep in mind with the actual physical design is to keep the the speaker close enough to the outside . ami_da_6
C 1564.3 Okay . ami_da_2
C 1564.74 Yeah . ami_da_2
C 1565.38 So these these were the component selection and these things . ami_da_4
C 1568.76 We can go to the next slide . ami_da_6
C 1573.14 And these were the findings which I I saw with the web web , that user wants to have control more than one device wants to control more than one device from the same remote control , ami_da_4
C 1573.14 so our TV remote can have little extra things to support additional devices like VCR DVD players which are usually attached with the TV , ami_da_6
C 1573.14 because users are like this and they do not want to have one remote control for everything , ami_da_4
C 1573.14 so with this additional little , we might be having slightly better market for us . ami_da_9
B 1596.92 Although , if ami_da_3
B 1596.92 It depends , if we like , if we are concentrating on like a fruit design , then maybe maybe we want to sell a collection of fruit , you know , like a different fruit for each device . ami_da_6
C 1608.83 Of fruits . ami_da_1
B 1611.19 Cause that , you know , that sometimes people like to collect you know things that of a similar type . ami_da_4
C 1615.16 Remotes ami_da_4
C 1615.16 objects , okay . ami_da_9
A 1615.52 S objects . ami_da_4
A 1617.9 Crazy objects . ami_da_9
D 1618.39 I think that would be funny at the beginning but after one month you will be tired of be surrounded of fruits . ami_da_9
B 1626.13 Well , you are the one who wanted to do fruit in the first place . ami_da_9
D 1627.81 No ami_da_6
D 1627.81 but I think just one fruit to control everything . ami_da_6
B 1631.18 Like a power fruit . ami_da_14
D 1632.25 A power fr a power M a Mando , a Supermando fruit . ami_da_14
C 1637.93 And as well as I could see on the web the scroll button is becoming really hot thing s ami_da_4
C 1637.93 and we should have it on the remote . ami_da_6
B 1644.51 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 1644.78 Okay . ami_da_1
D 1646.97 Actually I ami_da_5
D 1646.97 I did not understand very well this trace speaker lost control . ami_da_5
B 1647.09 Well ami_da_3
B 1647.09 I think that is a pretty handy feature . ami_da_9
A 1647.1 Okay , good . ami_da_9
C 1652.33 So you are having a basis station . ami_da_4
C 1654.97 Okay . ami_da_11
C 1655.87 Your ami_da_2
C 1655.87 usually your remote sits on that . ami_da_4
C 1658.3 So you ami_da_2
C 1658.3 and it is that is why it can have chargeable batteries . ami_da_4
C 1661.83 Now let is say ami_da_3
C 1661.83 Basis station is with the thing . ami_da_4
D 1662.13 So you you have to buy two things , the banana and the basis station . ami_da_4
A 1665.05 Bu it is it is . ami_da_2
A 1667.69 You s you you thing . ami_da_4
C 1670.55 It is like a telephone handset is there and the basis station for the telephone hand set is there . ami_da_4
C 1675.33 So now what user gets additionally he does not have to buy batteries , they are rechargeable batteries , so over the period of cor time he will recover the cost . ami_da_4
C 1684.56 So you are having the basis station and there is a button , if you press that button wherever the remote it will start beeping ami_da_4
C 1684.56 so you know where the remote is . ami_da_4
A 1693.51 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 1694.03 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 1694.9 I think it is kind of people would find that worth it even if it was not a recharging station , even if they did not have to buy extra batteries , you know . ami_da_9
D 1703.8 Yeah ami_da_9
D 1703.8 but I am a bit worried about the budget . ami_da_9
B 1704.09 So ami_da_3
B 1704.09 Although you do need to include RF kind of circuitry in the remote . ami_da_4
C 1706.73 this is ami_da_2
C 1706.73 basis station is nothing more , just it is a wire which is coming from the main cable and you are having one socket on which the thing sits . ami_da_4
C 1719.89 That is right . ami_da_9
C 1720.98 But all these things are usually in house so we do not have much problems . ami_da_9
C 1725.29 So component cost is going to be the least . ami_da_4
C 1727.89 Anyway , we are not using really advanced technology , LCD has already been ruled out , ASR has been ruled out . ami_da_4
C 1733.05 So it is the basic thing but very trendy and very user friendly . ami_da_9
B 1738.42 Okay . ami_da_1
C 1738.93 And ami_da_3
B 1739.3 I am just wondering actually , because , you know , I this whole fruit thing with the banana , it is it seemed like it first seems a bit kind of niche , like only a few people would really want a banana , ami_da_9
B 1739.3 but what if it was kind of a stylised banana ? ami_da_6
B 1739.3 You know , rather than having it kind of you know yellow and really looking exactly like a banana , you could make it kind of silver . ami_da_6
B 1762.22 And , you know to give you kind of the idea of a banana ami_da_9
B 1762.22 but without it looking you know completely kitsch . ami_da_9
B 1772.36 For better want of a better word ami_da_9
B 1772.36 you know ? ami_da_11
B 1772.36 Well , you know , I don I do not know how many peop ami_da_3
B 1772.36 Well they ami_da_3
B 1772.36 Yeah , like this colour this colour ami_da_9
B 1772.36 Maybe , you know , ami_da_2
B 1772.36 maybe like still in the shape of a banana . ami_da_6
A 1774.42 You think that yellow it is kitsch . ami_da_11
A 1779.09 If you make something that looks like a banana it should have the colour of a banana . ami_da_9
D 1779.47 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 1782.2 No , I I ami_da_3
D 1782.2 Maybe li like that . ami_da_6
C 1784.56 A ami_da_9
C 1784.56 yeah , otherwise it will be ami_da_9
C 1784.56 mis means you do not get b any feeling then . ami_da_9
A 1785.92 O otherwise ami_da_3
A 1785.92 Roughly . ami_da_9
C 1789.35 It is neither a banana nor a ami_da_9
C 1789.35 And going to the last slide . ami_da_6
B 1799.55 No , exactly . ami_da_14
B 1801.85 Exactly . ami_da_9
B 1802.84 , but you know , just maybe maybe not exactly the same texture as a banana ami_da_6
B 1802.84 and just kind of , you know ami_da_16
B 1802.84 because the thing is it is going to be a little bit difficult to make to give like the texture of a banana anyway and to k to have the exact shape . ami_da_9
B 1817.99 I think if you are going to not be able to do it properly ami_da_9
B 1817.99 you may as well do it in a stylised way that just looks a bit more kind of , you know , twenty first century rather than sixties or seventies . ami_da_9
A 1826.47 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 1830.4 Okay . ami_da_6
A 1831.37 Let is move on . ami_da_6
A 1832.02 yeah . ami_da_9
A 1833.28 Before before st before ending the meeting I would like to to draw some sketch about the pro future prot prototype . ami_da_6
B 1839.66 Okay . ami_da_1
A 1840.27 Go for it . ami_da_6
C 1841.46 Okay . ami_da_1
A 1843.47 Well no , not not you , ami_da_4
A 1843.47 you can finish your slides before ami_da_6
A 1843.47 okay . ami_da_1
C 1844.94 Okay . ami_da_1
C 1845.82 Okay , ami_da_9
C 1845.82 so . ami_da_2
C 1846.42 Anyway , users will be ami_da_2
C 1846.42 so the findings is users will be very interested in our locator device to find their misplaced remotes . ami_da_4
C 1853.01 So that was very ami_da_2
C 1853.01 I thought it is a very good suggestion by everybody . ami_da_9
A 1856.88 Okay . ami_da_1
C 1857.05 That is it . ami_da_4
A 1857.68 That is all ? ami_da_12
A 1857.68 Okay , so ami_da_2
A 1857.68 so well done for the presentations . ami_da_9
C 1858.16 Yep . ami_da_4
A 1862.69 So we need to take some de decisions about about what we are going to do . ami_da_6
A 1868.79 So I I propose that you go to the whiteboard and we are going to report all the ideas we had we had during this these presentations just to draw some sketch about what will be the prod final product ami_da_6
A 1868.79 and where Superman go banana and ami_da_14
A 1868.79 extra func functionalities such as wheels , the speaker unit well not in order not to lost the the device , ami_da_4
A 1868.79 I do I do not remember you call it ? ami_da_5
A 1868.79 Basis station , yeah . ami_da_12
B 1871.92 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 1881.68 Okay . ami_da_1
C 1901.93 That is right . ami_da_4
C 1902.44 The basis station . ami_da_4
C 1903.4 That is right . ami_da_4
A 1904.95 so ami_da_2
A 1904.95 so we are going for a stylish banana shape . ami_da_9
B 1912.77 Yeah , ami_da_9
B 1912.77 so , I guess you want to hold like the way ami_da_2
B 1912.77 the end of the banana you want to kind of hold as ma you maybe want to kind of hold like a gun rather than because you do not want it to point kind of towards the floor . ami_da_6
A 1923.31 Yeah , right . ami_da_9
B 1925.2 So ami_da_2
B 1925.2 you know , so if you have like ami_da_3
B 1925.2 Okay , ami_da_2
B 1925.2 so ami_da_2
B 1925.2 So ami_da_2
B 1925.2 okay , ami_da_9
B 1925.2 so I guess we need , you know , something that can fit a banana shaped object . ami_da_6
D 1929.59 What about what about this shape ? ami_da_6
D 1929.59 More or less . ami_da_6
A 1933.75 We I if it i if it has really the model shape of a bana ami_da_3
A 1933.75 you could ami_da_3
A 1933.75 the the starting is good but it could it should have more the shape of a banana if you want to point really a at the thing . ami_da_9
C 1934.37 There is less space on this to put with the buttons . ami_da_9
D 1938.14 Yeah , ami_da_9
D 1938.14 but how many buttons do we need ? ami_da_11
D 1938.14 What a What about ami_da_3
D 1938.14 Four millions ? ami_da_4
D 1938.14 What about a ami_da_3
D 1938.14 I wo what about adding the this word spotting , keyword spotting recognition saying volume up volume down ? ami_da_6
D 1938.14 It is too difficult but people like innovation and that is really innovative and I do not know if it would cost a lot , just a few five words . ami_da_9
A 1947.35 If you do not want to to to do that movement which is which is difficult ami_da_4
A 1947.35 if you do not have to do it in fact , it is better . ami_da_9
C 1956.09 what about a ami_da_3
C 1956.09 The base station . ami_da_4
