A 8.17 Right well . ami_da_2
A 9.94 Welcome to the what should be the last of these meetings ami_da_14
A 9.94 and it looks like we have done a good job here ami_da_9
A 9.94 and we will just go through the the final the final details . ami_da_6
A 24.17 okay , ami_da_2
A 24.17 oh ami_da_2
A 24.17 the th the the minutes of the last meeting I think we will take those as read , ami_da_6
A 24.17 Okay ami_da_2
A 24.17 the th the the next thing ami_da_4
A 24.17 we ami_da_4
A 24.17 we we will have a look at the th ami_da_4
A 24.17 have a look at the prototypes and look at the evaluation criteria and finance and then just tidy up with production ami_da_4
A 24.17 and and then we can close . ami_da_4
A 55.07 So f if if you would like to present your your proposals . ami_da_6
B 65.79 okay ami_da_2
B 65.79 we basically have the same kind of lay out here ami_da_4
B 65.79 it is just ami_da_3
B 65.79 you hold it like this ami_da_4
B 65.79 and it gets kind of moulded to the to the shape of your hand , basically . ami_da_4
B 74.59 on the left we have got the scroll for the volume , on the right we have buttons for the channels up and down and that kind of ami_da_4
B 74.59 so you can hold it and scroll , or you can hold it and and push . ami_da_4
B 85.01 this is the power key , it is kind of like the biggest ami_da_4
B 85.01 so you know how to turn on . ami_da_4
A 89.25 Uh huh . ami_da_12
B 89.76 that is the little menu key . ami_da_4
B 92.04 This is the infra red section ami_da_4
B 92.04 so you g ami_da_3
B 92.04 it will be sending rays and if you are you know pointing it like that it can send it , or if you hold it up like that it will send it . ami_da_4
A 97.95 Yep , yeah , good , good . ami_da_1
B 100.92 we got a microphone there which for all the voice commands so you can you know talk to it like that ami_da_4
B 100.92 and it will still understand . ami_da_4
A 104.3 Uh huh . ami_da_1
A 105.63 Yep , right . ami_da_1
B 107.29 the logo is down down there and has the cover on it ami_da_4
B 107.29 and you can see like it just kind of goes ami_da_3
B 107.29 the red bit is the cover and it kind of goes over everything ami_da_4
B 107.29 and then there is holes for the buttons to come through . ami_da_4
A 110.73 Uh huh . ami_da_1
C 111.72 S ami_da_3
C 111.72 And so we figured it would be kind of you know a light weight plastic , just kind of a light non descript grey ami_da_6
C 111.72 so that people will want to buy the covers ami_da_4
C 111.72 and then the covers will be that sort of rubbery material like they make iPod covers , ami_da_6
C 111.72 so they kind of just stretch over . ami_da_4
A 117.29 Yep , yep , . ami_da_1
A 124.44 Uh huh . ami_da_1
A 124.88 Yep yep . ami_da_1
A 128.23 Yep . ami_da_1
A 134.41 showing me age , ami_da_15
A 134.41 I do not know what i c iPod covers are like . ami_da_5
C 137.43 Yeah , well ami_da_2
C 137.43 I I did not know that ami_da_4
C 137.43 but yeah they are kind of ami_da_3
C 137.43 it is just kind of a rubbery ami_da_4
C 137.43 and that way ami_da_3
C 137.43 you know ami_da_2
C 137.43 spongy like is something that people wanted and it just sort of stretches over and that way ami_da_4
C 137.43 I think probably helps protect it a little bit too as well ami_da_4
C 137.43 and ami_da_3
C 137.43 just kind of stretch it over and it will just stay on and then the buttons come through ami_da_6
C 137.43 and so and then the ami_da_3
C 137.43 each one of them on the very end will have the logo with the yellow circle and the RR . ami_da_6
A 138.25 Yeah yeah . ami_da_16
A 141.1 Uh huh . ami_da_1
B 141.66 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 142.55 Okay , ami_da_12
A 142.55 yep , right . ami_da_1
B 150.4 But it is also e e easier to put on versus like mobile covers ami_da_9
B 150.4 you actually have to screw them on and stuff ami_da_4
B 150.4 and you kind of sometimes have to get someone to do that for you . ami_da_4
A 150.86 Okay . ami_da_12
B 155.9 This is very much you should be able to stretch it over yourself ami_da_6
B 155.9 and it will be fine . ami_da_9
A 156.85 Yep . ami_da_1
A 159.39 Okay , ami_da_12
A 159.39 good ami_da_9
A 159.39 yeah . ami_da_9
B 159.77 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 161.25 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 168.29 Yep , right . ami_da_12
B 169.75 Li ami_da_3
B 169.75 that will be the covers as well , ami_da_6
B 169.75 yeah ami_da_6
B 169.75 yeah . ami_da_6
C 171.05 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 171.09 Yeah , ami_da_12
A 171.09 yeah . ami_da_12
A 172.36 I mean tha it is it is a detailed point , ami_da_3
A 172.36 I just wondered I mean ami_da_8
A 172.36 h how will people put these down I wonder ? ami_da_8
A 172.36 Right . ami_da_12
C 178.23 Like that . ami_da_6
A 182.91 Okay ami_da_2
A 182.91 for some strange re reason I had it in my mind that they would put them down vertically ami_da_4
A 182.91 but ami_da_3
A 182.91 Yeah , no ami_da_2
A 182.91 because particularly if they have dif if they are going to have it as a you know as a fashion item ami_da_4
A 182.91 I mean it ami_da_4
A 182.91 it is it ami_da_4
A 182.91 it is just ami_da_4
A 182.91 I mean it is just a minor detailed point , ami_da_4
A 182.91 but as you say you can just make the base a little bit bigger ami_da_9
A 182.91 and ami_da_3
A 182.91 Yeah ami_da_2
A 182.91 and it just needs another another logo somewhere is is is is all ami_da_6
A 182.91 it gives gives people the option ami_da_4
A 182.91 and if if say if they have got them ami_da_3
A 182.91 because actually have several upon the ami_da_6
A 182.91 Yeah , well . ami_da_1
B 187.05 Yeah it could stand , yeah . ami_da_9
C 188.11 Oh . ami_da_12
B 188.98 Well ami_da_2
B 188.98 we could broaden the broaden it out a bit ami_da_6
B 188.98 so it would stand like that . ami_da_4
B 196.87 Yeah , standing . ami_da_9
B 203.97 Yeah , ami_da_9
B 203.97 we could just widen it out ami_da_6
D 218.53 Could have one for your stereo , one for your DV player . ami_da_6
B 219.05 , yeah , ami_da_9
B 219.05 yeah . ami_da_9
C 219.94 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 220.63 Have to ami_da_3
B 220.63 if we just lengthen it I guess ami_da_6
B 220.63 so it comes down to the base of the hand ami_da_4
B 220.63 and then flatten it out ami_da_6
B 220.63 and could sit there . ami_da_4
C 221.74 Yeah , ami_da_9
C 221.74 just kind of ami_da_3
C 221.74 Or just make it little . ami_da_6
A 222.4 Yeah ami_da_2
A 222.4 but that that is ami_da_3
A 222.4 but ami_da_3
A 222.4 no ami_da_9
A 222.4 the the the overall the overall concept is ami_da_3
A 222.4 yeah yeah , ami_da_9
A 222.4 no no , ami_da_2
A 222.4 I mean that is these ami_da_3
A 222.4 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 226.87 Yeah , . ami_da_1
C 228.93 Somewhere like that ami_da_6
C 228.93 so it just sort of ami_da_3
C 228.93 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 229.27 Yeah . ami_da_9
B 230.43 Yeah . ami_da_9
B 232.31 We might have to lengthen it ami_da_6
B 232.31 so it kind of your hand still holds it and have it there , ami_da_4
B 232.31 yeah , ami_da_9
B 232.31 yeah , ami_da_9
B 232.31 yeah ami_da_9
B 232.31 like that , like that . ami_da_9
D 232.66 Yeah ami_da_2
D 232.66 I kind of had a a kind of a natural kind of a idea ami_da_7
D 232.66 where it is like more of a kind of like a kind of maybe slightly like thinner , ami_da_6
D 232.66 yeah , kind of like that ami_da_9
D 232.66 kind of like a flower or a plant ami_da_6
D 232.66 for the more natural kind of ami_da_3
D 232.66 yeah , ami_da_9
D 232.66 just click there . ami_da_6
B 238.71 Yeah . ami_da_9
C 238.72 Bu . ami_da_3
A 242.88 But yeah but no th but ami_da_3
A 242.88 the yeah ami_da_3
A 242.88 the the the ami_da_3
A 242.88 Yeah , ami_da_9
A 242.88 yeah , ami_da_9
A 242.88 yeah , ami_da_9
A 242.88 I mean it it is would not ami_da_3
A 242.88 would not do that , indeed yeah . ami_da_9
C 249.1 fall over . ami_da_3
B 249.29 The final product would actually stand up , yeah . ami_da_4
C 251.12 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 251.35 But th th but th ami_da_3
A 251.35 yeah ami_da_3
A 251.35 th ami_da_3
A 251.35 b the ami_da_3
A 251.35 these were all minor minor minor details , ami_da_4
A 251.35 I think the the basic concept i i is is absolutely bang on ami_da_9
A 251.35 and the i ami_da_3
A 251.35 it certainly meets our criteria of being of you know looking different . ami_da_4
B 253.86 Yeah , ami_da_9
B 253.86 yeah . ami_da_9
C 254.2 Yeah . ami_da_9
B 257.25 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 257.66 Is a little longer . ami_da_16
B 260.23 Wee ami_da_16
C 265.08 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 265.48 , so ami_da_2
A 265.48 good that is that that is excellent . ami_da_9
A 269.78 right ami_da_2
A 269.78 let us ami_da_3
A 269.78 What is on the next one ? ami_da_5
A 269.78 Oh right yes , ami_da_4
A 269.78 let is have a look at the f finance . ami_da_6
A 284.15 , now ami_da_2
A 284.15 we are given a a clear design brief , ami_da_4
A 284.15 if I get the spreadsheet up . ami_da_7
A 303.36 Oh . ami_da_16
D 312.72 the the maximise button . ami_da_6
A 315.75 Oh right . ami_da_12
A 319.52 Good , ami_da_9
A 319.52 this is why we need to make these things simple ami_da_4
A 319.52 so that the the the the boss can understand . ami_da_15
A 324.71 Now ami_da_2
A 324.71 I have ami_da_3
A 324.71 this is the company is costing for for various aspects of design and I I ami_da_4
A 324.71 I have treated some of these slightly liberally given the constraints placed on us , ami_da_4
A 324.71 I would not know for in ami_da_3
A 324.71 for instance if if they require us to have it in the corporate colours , then that is not a special colour , that is a that is a standard colour . ami_da_4
A 352.44 , so ami_da_2
A 352.44 we are just simply on batteries , the the one th the one decision I have had to make is that ami_da_4
A 352.44 we are we will have to find a s a regular standard chip to to do this with ami_da_6
A 352.44 and I I ami_da_4
A 352.44 I am ami_da_4
A 352.44 I am ami_da_4
A 352.44 I am certain that they they are around ami_da_4
A 352.44 so , ami_da_2
A 352.44 that I do not think is a a serious problem . ami_da_9
A 376.56 The the the voice sensor is is expensive ami_da_9
A 376.56 but we we made a a basic decision that that was absolutely fundamental to the to the design ami_da_4
A 376.56 so that that has to stay . ami_da_6
A 388.07 then again the the the the shape of the case means that it is it is expensive to l to make because of the the th the double curves ami_da_9
A 388.07 but on the other hand because of our overall fashion concept we we should exceed the the sales targets . ami_da_4
A 407.94 it is simply made of plastic ami_da_4
A 407.94 so th that is that is no problem ami_da_9
A 407.94 and ami_da_2
A 407.94 just because the whole the colour of the the whole thing that is there is some cost there . ami_da_4
A 423.79 and ami_da_2
A 423.79 we have not actually got a scroll wheel ami_da_4
A 423.79 we ami_da_4
A 423.79 we we got push buttons and and a simple slider ami_da_4
A 423.79 so ami_da_2
A 423.79 and the and the the buttons are ami_da_3
A 423.79 well ami_da_2
A 423.79 I do do not know that they are special colour . ami_da_4
A 446.31 Anyway ami_da_2
A 446.31 the the costings come in at exactly on target at twelve point five ami_da_4
A 446.31 but I thi ami_da_9
A 446.31 I think we have a a very strong case to argue that what what we have got is is so in innovative and and different ami_da_9
A 446.31 that any any slight compromise we have to make on on cost is is offset by the ami_da_4
A 446.31 you know ami_da_4
A 446.31 the ami_da_4
A 446.31 you know the the the the concept of it being a a fashion accessory and and having the the interchangeable covers ami_da_4
A 446.31 so you know ami_da_2
A 446.31 the if if ami_da_3
A 446.31 if the management expect us to be techno again fail again technologically innovative that they they have to accept that we we ca not operate absolutely within the constraints that they give , ami_da_4
A 446.31 so ami_da_2
A 446.31 we we we present this as the the company is the the company is way forward ami_da_6
A 446.31 and ami_da_2
A 446.31 I I think we can argue that we we have come in on on budget . ami_da_4
A 512.19 Okay , . ami_da_2
A 517.56 So . ami_da_2
A 521.16 Does anybody want to ami_da_3
A 521.16 Andrew do you want what do you want to say about the yeah the evaluation ami_da_11
A 521.16 where where you know well where where we are where where we are at ? ami_da_3
A 521.16 The the the well the ami_da_4
A 521.16 I meant the product . ami_da_4
D 528.29 Evaluation . ami_da_4
D 533.92 The the product or the project ? ami_da_5
D 533.92 , well well ami_da_2
D 533.92 my presentation just now ? ami_da_7
D 533.92 Sure , ami_da_9
D 533.92 can I get the ami_da_6
D 533.92 Cheers . ami_da_14
A 542.28 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 544.19 Oh ami_da_12
A 544.19 sorry ami_da_14
A 544.19 yeah , . ami_da_9
A 553.94 More loud clicks in the microphone . ami_da_4
D 569.83 There we go , oh . ami_da_16
D 573.14 Method of evaluation testing the product was to just if it met all the criteria all the conditions that we set out to set out to solve , from the point of view of the the consumer and the management . ami_da_4
D 586.25 So ami_da_2
D 586.25 what I have been asked to do is , on the whiteboard gauge our team response to these questions . ami_da_4
D 599.2 So , ami_da_2
D 599.2 on a scale of one to seven , one being true and seven being being false . ami_da_4
A 604.9 Seven being a nice round number to work to . ami_da_14
D 607.72 Yeah . ami_da_12
D 609.17 And then at the end just take an average ami_da_4
D 609.17 Yes . ami_da_12
A 611.72 Tr ami_da_3
A 611.72 On for true and seven for flase . ami_da_14
A 617.2 Yes . ami_da_16
D 627.72 So . ami_da_2
D 637.67 So , ami_da_2
D 637.67 look at these questions . ami_da_6
D 639.92 Is the device f flashy and fashionable ? ami_da_11
D 639.92 So ami_da_2
D 639.92 and also technologically innovative ? ami_da_11
D 639.92 Easy to use ? ami_da_11
D 639.92 suitable for the consumer ? ami_da_11
D 639.92 That was ami_da_3
D 639.92 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 643.74 Well ami_da_2
A 643.74 I think most definitely . ami_da_9
B 644.25 Yeah I would say definitely a one ami_da_9
B 644.25 yeah . ami_da_9
C 644.27 I think it is yeah . ami_da_9
A 652.9 Yes ami_da_9
A 652.9 the voice technology indeed . ami_da_4
B 653.25 Yeah , defi ami_da_9
B 653.25 yeah , ami_da_9
B 653.25 yeah ami_da_9
B 653.25 Yeah . ami_da_9
C 653.49 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 660.05 I do not see we could have made it any easier . ami_da_9
C 660.35 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 668.33 Totally . ami_da_9
B 668.84 Yeah definitely . ami_da_9
C 669.4 Yeah I think it made we met all of the consumer wants . ami_da_9
B 673.03 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 676.62 is it complicated ? ami_da_11
D 676.62 Doing pretty well so far ami_da_14
D 676.62 are not we ? functional ? ami_da_11
A 678.07 No . ami_da_9
C 678.36 No . ami_da_9
A 683.94 Yeah . ami_da_9
B 684.0 Yeah definitely . ami_da_9
C 684.2 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 690.97 Where are we ? ami_da_5
D 690.97 We have b built in the the speech , where are you , function . ami_da_4
A 691.68 found easily . ami_da_11
A 694.03 yeah ami_da_9
A 694.03 I mean that is that is ami_da_3
A 694.03 Yeah . ami_da_9
B 694.72 Yeah . ami_da_9
B 696.29 Yeah . ami_da_9
B 696.59 Yeah , . ami_da_9
C 696.8 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 699.01 Uh huh . ami_da_16
A 701.25 Does it take long to learn to use ? ami_da_11
A 701.25 Should not . ami_da_9
B 703.57 No , not at all . ami_da_9
D 706.76 And , ami_da_2
D 706.76 what else ? ami_da_5
D 706.76 The RSI compares to the current standards , ami_da_11
D 706.76 well . ami_da_2
A 711.78 Less buttons ami_da_5
A 711.78 so it must be . ami_da_9
B 712.1 Yeah it is sorta the the handle more ergonomically correct as well . ami_da_9
D 713.14 We we ami_da_3
D 713.14 yeah ami_da_2
D 713.14 it was our it was a ami_da_3
D 713.14 we made an actual effort to ami_da_4
D 713.14 will device appeal to all age groups ? ami_da_11
D 713.14 Yeah , that is a good call , yeah . ami_da_9
C 718.69 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 719.37 So yeah , . ami_da_9
B 719.75 yeah . ami_da_3
A 726.52 I think it will ami_da_9
A 726.52 because I mean old older people who ca not manage the buttons anyway will actually probably like the like like the voice bit so ami_da_4
A 726.52 And it is it is it ami_da_3
A 726.52 is ami_da_3
A 726.52 well ami_da_2
A 726.52 I do not think we are actually charging a particular premium anyway , in the end , so ami_da_4
A 726.52 Yeah . ami_da_9
C 727.5 I think so . ami_da_9
D 734.48 Well ami_da_2
D 734.48 we had the we had the data saying that old people will be less likely to pay extra money but the funct the increased functionality , the e ease of use of the device might make up for that . ami_da_4
B 751.23 I I ami_da_9
B 751.23 I think it will tend to appeal more to younger aged groups ami_da_9
B 751.23 just because we have gone with the fashion focus and the younger people tend to would be more conscious of that aspect of it , ami_da_4
B 751.23 but I think it should still appeal on a certain level to everybody , yeah . ami_da_9
C 751.88 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 756.19 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 761.94 It will appeal f for dif for different reasons ami_da_9
A 761.94 but it is it is ami_da_3
A 761.94 yeah yeah ami_da_9
A 761.94 so I I ami_da_3
A 761.94 yeah ami_da_3
A 761.94 I ami_da_3
A 761.94 Yeah , ami_da_9
A 761.94 so ami_da_2
A 761.94 I think we can reasonably say it is another another one , ami_da_6
A 761.94 why not ? ami_da_11
A 761.94 in in in in my interpretation of management is instructions is that yes it it meets the requirement ami_da_9
A 761.94 is t ami_da_4
A 761.94 it is television only , it is it is simple to use , it is it is it is within budget , ami_da_4
A 761.94 I it is yes an an any minor points we we we argue . ami_da_16
C 763.69 Yeah ami_da_9
C 763.69 I think just the simplicity of it ami_da_4
C 763.69 and ami_da_3
C 763.69 not having to learn to programme and not having you know a million buttons . ami_da_4
B 763.91 Yeah , ami_da_9
