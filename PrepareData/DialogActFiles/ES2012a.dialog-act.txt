D 165.14 Oh ami_da_2
D 165.14 my name is Andrew ami_da_4
D 165.14 I am a ami_da_4
D 165.14 I am the Market Research person for this for this meeting and this project for creating this new remote control ami_da_4
D 165.14 and ami_da_4
D 165.14 yeah ami_da_4
D 165.14 I will be presenting information statistics on what people want to want to get from this new design , what people want to like and from a fashion point of view and the practicality point of view . ami_da_4
A 190.8 Right ami_da_2
A 190.8 Kendra . ami_da_6
C 192.1 I am Kendra and I am the Us User Interface Designer and I have not had a whole lot of experience in this kind of thing before ami_da_4
C 192.1 but I am m ami_da_3
C 192.1 so ami_da_2
C 192.1 I will be working on the design . ami_da_4
A 208.28 Right ami_da_2
A 208.28 at least means you have not got any preconceived ideas ami_da_4
A 208.28 so . ami_da_3
C 211.39 Right . ami_da_9
C 213.31 Yep , ami_da_2
C 213.31 I am just open to being creative . ami_da_7
A 215.53 Yep , ami_da_2
A 215.53 good . ami_da_14
B 217.19 I am Katie , I am the Industrial Designer ami_da_4
B 217.19 and I will just be ami_da_4
B 217.19 I guess presenting about the the inter workings of our little remote control ami_da_4
B 217.19 and ami_da_3
B 217.19 yeah . ami_da_4
A 227.59 Okay , ami_da_2
A 227.59 very very quickly , this ami_da_3
A 227.59 I do not want to make this meeting too structured ami_da_7
A 227.59 because the the whole idea is that it is a you know a think tank . ami_da_6
A 239.66 Everybody says what they what they want to say , and we do not want to be constrained by kind of convention or slides on screens or or anything else ami_da_6
A 239.66 but briefly th th ami_da_7
A 239.66 this is what we want to do . ami_da_7
A 259.7 The the remote control needs to be original , there has to be something about it that other remote controls do not have so that as soon as people see it they think yes that is different ami_da_4
A 259.7 , I want one , and that goes along with being trendy ami_da_4
A 259.7 , you know the ami_da_4
A 259.7 I want it scenario . ami_da_4
A 282.32 User friendly as as we all know , remote controls can be very user unfriendly so we want to make ours one that people can pick up and think oh yes that is it is obvious how that works , and they also want to look at the price and think ami_da_4
A 282.32 oh yeah ami_da_4
A 282.32 that is something that I may not need another remote control ami_da_4
A 282.32 but it is such a nice one I am going to have one . ami_da_4
A 310.27 And last but not least , or indeed first of all , it it must make the company money , and we make the company money by producing what the consumer wants . ami_da_6
A 324.99 The the further work to be done is i the the functional design , what it what it must actually do , the conceptual design , how we actually present that to the consumer and th the the detailed design i is how we get that into production . ami_da_4
A 353.18 now th the main design tool that we have available to us at the moment is is the white board ami_da_4
A 353.18 and let us very quickly do what i what it says in the in the in the prompt slide here , ami_da_6
A 353.18 In fact I suggest to avoid everybody untangling themselves from the the the wires , that we do not do that , ami_da_6
A 353.18 So ami_da_2
A 353.18 I I ami_da_3
A 353.18 everybody knows what whiteboard is ami_da_4
A 353.18 so we will we will do a virtual drawing on the on on the whiteboard of of your your own favourite animal , but le let is go round the table , ami_da_6
A 353.18 your favourite animal . ami_da_5
D 402.99 , badger . ami_da_4
A 404.53 and why ? ami_da_5
A 404.53 Uh huh . ami_da_1
D 405.8 it is it is got nice contrast with black and white ami_da_4
D 405.8 and I feel they are ami_da_4
D 405.8 underdog kind of status ami_da_4
D 405.8 and they are , the ami_da_3
D 405.8 Make mobile phones and TV remotes to make TV remotes . ami_da_4
A 415.12 Oh right ami_da_2
A 415.12 my my wife says my beard looks like a badger is arse because of the the white streaks in it . ami_da_4
A 423.66 Kendra . ami_da_5
C 424.75 probably a duck ami_da_4
C 424.75 I ami_da_4
C 424.75 just I li ami_da_4
C 424.75 I like the way they look ami_da_4
C 424.75 and they are just nice animals ami_da_9
C 424.75 and I like how they can fly or swim or walk around or whatever . ami_da_4
A 434.02 Uh huh . ami_da_1
A 435.42 Right , ami_da_2
A 435.42 okay . ami_da_6
B 436.06 is horses , no particular reason why . ami_da_4
A 438.73 Uh huh , ami_da_1
A 438.73 fair enough ami_da_14
A 438.73 yeah . ami_da_14
A 440.01 I am not sure that I have got any favourite animal to be quite honest , I think homo sapien because of their their overall ability to ami_da_4
A 440.01 Sorry ? ami_da_12
A 440.01 Indeed absolutely yes , ami_da_9
A 440.01 tha that is ami_da_3
A 440.01 Okay ami_da_2
A 440.01 and w we need to keep in mind here that the we want to sell this for for twenty five Euro , we want to m make an overall profit for the the company of fifty million Euros ami_da_4
A 440.01 so we are we are looking at selling a lot of these ag across the the entire planet ami_da_4
A 440.01 and and we are looking at a gross profit of fifty percent . ami_da_4
A 484.82 It needs to cost twelve Euros fifty to make . ami_da_4
A 488.18 so we are not only looking at a a very trendy original product , ami_da_4
A 488.18 we are looking at making it at a very good price . ami_da_9
A 498.92 , okay , ami_da_2
A 498.92 would anybody like t like to to start by giving their o sort of quick views of of current remote controls . ami_da_8
C 513.71 Well ami_da_2
C 513.71 I think I find a lot of them really complicated to use with all the different buttons and it is handiest when you have one that works both the DVD player or whatever and the TV as well . ami_da_9
C 526.12 , but that it is easy to if you can switch back and forth instead of having to press a bunch of different buttons ami_da_9
C 526.12 and ami_da_3
C 526.12 so I think it is is best when they are clearly labelled and you can see which buttons you are supposed to use , ami_da_9
C 526.12 you know . ami_da_13
A 529.9 No . ami_da_1
A 544.34 Any any thoughts about buttons or any oth other way of approaching the p the the problem ? ami_da_8
A 544.34 Or anybody else , strong feelings about remote controls ? ami_da_11
A 544.34 Are there you know , bad ones they have used or good ones they have used or ones that they have lost and never found again ? ami_da_5
A 544.34 what so wh what is in in what particular style features are you thinking about ? ami_da_8
A 544.34 Uh huh . ami_da_12
B 559.7 I think it is important that you should be able to when you when you press the buttons it will actually pick up the signals from kind of anywhere ami_da_6
B 559.7 and you should not have to like contort yourself and twist your remote control to get it the TV to actually pick up the signal . ami_da_6
D 571.96 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 572.82 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 575.16 Think a lot of the time , remotes that come with TV players and TVs and DV players , like they are not like an area that is put a lot of effort into , ami_da_4
D 575.16 they are very boring , very plain . ami_da_9
D 585.86 Like ami_da_2
D 585.86 it is very a very ami_da_3
D 585.86 like ami_da_2
D 585.86 making a a stylish remote control would be a very like Easily put us one step ahead of the current competition . ami_da_9
D 600.95 Something that looks looks does not look like remote control . ami_da_6
D 604.51 So if you want , something that looks like something that makes you think ami_da_6
D 604.51 oh what is this ? ami_da_6
D 604.51 Like this pen does not really look like a pen , but it makes you think ami_da_4
D 604.51 oh . ami_da_4
D 613.18 So , ami_da_2
D 613.18 sorry ami_da_14
D 613.18 that is a bit vague . ami_da_9
A 616.08 Yeah ami_da_2
A 616.08 d ami_da_3
A 616.08 no ami_da_9
A 616.08 I mean do you think there is a risk if it does not look like remote control , people wo not see it as a remote control ami_da_5
A 616.08 and ami_da_2
A 616.08 Uh huh . ami_da_12
D 624.04 I suppose suppose that is up to the marketing to to make make people aware of the product . ami_da_6
A 635.07 Any other thoughts about th the physical appearance of a of remote controls ? ami_da_8
A 635.07 I mean th the thing that i immediately comes to mind is computer mouses which I mean y you get all sorts of shapes in the shops ami_da_4
A 635.07 and s you know some quite fancy ones ami_da_9
A 635.07 than the ami_da_3
A 635.07 some from personal experience which look nice but are not particularly comfortable . ami_da_9
C 641.68 I think something that is comfortable to hold ami_da_6
C 641.68 because sometimes you get the remote controls that are just those big , rectangular things ami_da_4
C 641.68 and they are kind of awkward to hold onto , ami_da_9
C 641.68 so something that is more comfortable that fits in a person is hand better . ami_da_6
C 661.82 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 662.76 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 668.67 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 676.64 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 677.0 any thoughts about buttons or flat screens or ami_da_8
A 677.0 Yes , ami_da_2
A 677.0 I mean the only thing is if if you are watching television in a in a a darkened room you need to be able to fi find the button buttons easily . ami_da_9
D 689.65 Well ami_da_2
D 689.65 from the mouse idea you could , ami_da_3
D 689.65 remote is a piece of plastic with the big rubber buttons sticking out of it which you press , ami_da_4
D 689.65 whereas if you want ami_da_3
D 689.65 could all be flat and the buttons are very kind of almost subtle that instead of being raised out of the device you push into device you see , like a mouse button . ami_da_6
D 716.12 I suppose . ami_da_9
D 719.3 Easily , yeah yeah . ami_da_9
C 722.05 But maybe they could be concave instead of sticking up to have them be kind of down ami_da_6
C 722.05 so you could feel them better . ami_da_9
A 729.96 Yeah , ami_da_2
A 729.96 that is ami_da_3
A 729.96 must admit I do not think I have ever seen one with concave buttons , that is certainly be different . ami_da_4
A 739.18 do we need it to ami_da_3
A 739.18 I ca not think of any re remote controls that I know of that actually light up at all . ami_da_4
A 749.85 Do we do we want ami_da_11
A 749.85 Yeah . ami_da_4
C 750.48 Oh yeah . ami_da_9
B 750.8 that would be good . ami_da_9
C 752.71 Like a like a mobile phone ? ami_da_5
C 752.71 Yeah . ami_da_4
D 755.68 , yeah that would be good . ami_da_9
A 765.65 Okay . ami_da_2
A 766.73 So , ami_da_2
A 766.73 Andrew have you had any thoughts yet about how we might market something ami_da_8
A 766.73 which there are already millions out there and that we want to t take over the entire the planet with ? ami_da_4
D 782.19 , especially if we try to sell , what two million of them . ami_da_4
D 790.38 Oh sorry , ami_da_14
D 790.38 four million of them , ami_da_4
D 790.38 but I think if w if we market it as as not as not ami_da_3
D 790.38 well ami_da_2
D 790.38 this you c ami_da_3
D 790.38 you could either market it as the point of view we could have the two ami_da_3
D 790.38 we could have parallel marketing s schemes where you have got one where it appeals to people that want to have the new device that looks cool , is fashionable ami_da_6
D 790.38 and like you just ami_da_3
D 790.38 it is it is like it is one that rather than ra ami_da_4
D 790.38 I wan ami_da_4
D 790.38 I want rather than a kind of a need relationship with the device , ami_da_4
D 790.38 but that might ami_da_3
D 790.38 considering the act what the device is for and the nature of some people might not like respond to having a device that they just looks nice , ami_da_4
D 790.38 therefore they want it ami_da_3
D 790.38 so make it practical at the same time . ami_da_6
D 830.08 I think it is this is going to have to appeal to people that want device that can enhance their living room but also a device that is practically sound . ami_da_4
D 845.41 So , ami_da_2
D 845.41 I dunno we will have to decide which which angle we are going to go to or both . ami_da_6
A 851.23 Okay , yeah , ami_da_2
A 851.23 yeah , ami_da_2
A 851.23 well ami_da_2
A 851.23 I ami_da_6
A 851.23 d I think an any any facets that we identify w we aim need to aim for for all of . ami_da_6
D 851.27 If you . ami_da_3
A 861.53 okay ami_da_2
A 861.53 well ami_da_2
A 861.53 first thoughts on the the industrial design side . ami_da_8
B 870.09 Oh ami_da_2
B 870.09 I think it is it is remote controls are kind of a unique object because it is you depend on them so much , ami_da_4
B 870.09 but you do not ami_da_3
B 870.09 i ami_da_3
B 870.09 i ami_da_3
B 870.09 it is ami_da_3
B 870.09 you sort of just assume they are always going to work , ami_da_4
B 870.09 you do not think of them as a comp ami_da_3
B 870.09 like a computer can break down and you are kind of like oh well fair enough there is all these complex things going on , ami_da_4
B 870.09 it is going to ami_da_3
B 870.09 something is going to get messed up eventually . ami_da_4
B 884.61 They they just need to be very very dependable ami_da_6
B 884.61 because people sort of take them for granted and then if your remote control breaks it is God forbid you actually get up and manually change the channel ami_da_4
B 884.61 it just ami_da_3
B 884.61 it needs to be very effective , very always dependable . ami_da_6
A 895.68 Indeed . ami_da_9
B 900.0 I do not think we should make it too small ami_da_6
B 900.0 I because I think it needs to ami_da_3
B 900.0 it ca not be too big like you were saying big an and huge and awkward , ami_da_9
B 900.0 but also if you make it too small kind of like you know how mobile phones are getting smaller and smaller , it is just going to end up under a couch cushion somewhere ami_da_4
B 900.0 and ami_da_4
B 900.0 yeah . ami_da_4
A 914.63 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 918.43 But ami_da_3
B 918.43 so ami_da_2
B 918.43 yes ami_da_9
B 918.43 dependable , and have a good medium range size . ami_da_6
A 923.89 Okay , ami_da_12
A 923.89 and colours , materials ? ami_da_8
A 923.89 Kendra , anyone ? ami_da_8
C 934.86 Well , ami_da_2
C 934.86 most I think most of the remote controls now are either just black or grey , ami_da_4
C 934.86 so maybe we should go with something different ami_da_6
C 934.86 or be able to ami_da_3
C 934.86 I was just thinking of what they are doing with mobile phones now ami_da_6
C 934.86 how you can get the different what are they called ? ami_da_4
C 934.86 Like the face plates that you change ami_da_4
C 934.86 so we could have maybe ami_da_3
C 934.86 I do not know if it would be feasible to do something with that , ami_da_9
C 934.86 where you can change the face plates or have kind of a variety so people can get different different things . ami_da_6
A 953.49 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 961.83 Uh huh . ami_da_1
C 965.93 Have it kind of look how they want to , different colours , things like that , probably just plastic ami_da_6
C 965.93 because that is always the lightest . ami_da_4
A 970.58 Right . ami_da_1
A 973.92 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 976.61 Okay ami_da_2
A 976.61 that is ami_da_3
A 976.61 Again I do not think that is ever been done before , ami_da_4
A 976.61 it is the sort of the sort of thing that would get people thinking yes that is something that I have not got and might need ami_da_9
A 976.61 so . ami_da_2
A 995.17 Andrew , any thoughts about how we might market interchangeable fronts on on the remote control ? ami_da_8
A 995.17 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 1005.4 , well ami_da_2
D 1005.4 we could either market it together by getting control in a set colour ami_da_6
D 1005.4 or with like you buy it with several ami_da_3
D 1005.4 like ami_da_2
D 1005.4 you ge you get the f the face plates with it when you buy or as a separate thing , ami_da_6
D 1005.4 but maybe thinking of that , it is considering the nature of the device , maybe a second thing like a second campaign to market new facials for your to your might go a bit astray ami_da_9
D 1005.4 since it is the kind of thing where y you generally get one and then forget about it . ami_da_4
D 1045.29 Unless you were trying to ami_da_3
A 1045.33 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 1046.26 Well ami_da_2
B 1046.26 you could come up with like novelty ones , ami_da_6
B 1046.26 like they have done with the the mobile phones , ami_da_4
B 1046.26 you can get like different you know scenes from different movies and stuff on the remote control and sorta stagger the release of them and get people like ami_da_6
B 1046.26 oh I want that cover on it now ami_da_6
B 1046.26 and that will keep them spending money . ami_da_4
A 1046.61 I think ami_da_3
A 1046.61 Mm mm . ami_da_1
C 1052.64 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 1054.05 Oh ami_da_2
D 1054.05 it is ami_da_3
D 1054.05 that is a that is a good idea . ami_da_9
C 1058.59 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 1060.77 Right , okay ami_da_2
A 1060.77 I think we have got a good idea now . ami_da_9
D 1060.84 Yeah true . ami_da_9
A 1065.95 We ami_da_3
A 1065.95 meeting is Needs to be k wrapped up fairly quickly . ami_da_6
A 1072.82 So ami_da_2
A 1072.82 we have got thirty minutes to start looking at the at the design in more detail . ami_da_4
A 1085.25 then we will we will reconvene in in thirty minutes and try to get some of these ideas more formalised . ami_da_4
