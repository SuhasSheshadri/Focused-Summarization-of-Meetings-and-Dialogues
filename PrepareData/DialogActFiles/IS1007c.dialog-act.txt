A 52.49 So we come to the third meetings . ami_da_14
A 55.38 I have ami_da_3
A 55.38 good . ami_da_9
A 60.25 so in the last meeting we have discussed the functional design and now we will talk about the conceptual design . ami_da_4
A 76.39 So we will talk about some specific details . ami_da_4
C 81.59 Okay so I think I will do my presentation on the components concept ami_da_7
C 81.59 so can you please open ami_da_6
C 81.59 I am participant two . ami_da_4
C 102.57 Components design . ami_da_4
A 103.06 This ami_da_3
A 103.06 this is what we have decided in the last meeting . ami_da_4
C 109.82 Okay so ami_da_2
C 109.82 the first thing I have done is to to made a review together with the manufactural department and have which components was available to build a remote control . ami_da_4
C 126.57 So for energy sources we have we have to choose between the solar energy , hand dynamo and kinetic well kinetic technique to to store the energy . ami_da_4
C 144.85 We also we also can put a regular battery in the in the remote control . ami_da_4
C 152.68 Now ami_da_2
C 152.68 Yeah ami_da_9
C 152.68 b f ami_da_4
C 152.68 well I meant by by battery ami_da_4
C 152.68 I meant I will not have a a wire between the remote control and the energy source ami_da_4
C 152.68 but I did not fou ami_da_3
C 152.68 we did not decide yet which kind of battery we will put inside the the remote . ami_da_4
A 156.12 But if we use battery ami_da_4
A 156.12 We will , okay . ami_da_7
C 181.06 So it is a point to discuss . ami_da_4
C 184.78 Then the case material we have also several choices , like wood , rubber , titanium or latex . ami_da_4
C 195.01 But well it is not a a re well a real issue for the from the technical point of view . ami_da_4
C 207.38 Concerning the interface we can we can put just simple buttons or scrolls or buttons much more complicated , but it also requires that the chip to process the button is more complicated so . ami_da_4
C 224.94 And this is the last point , the choice of chips . ami_da_4
C 230.36 So what I have f found is that I think basic battery or kinetic energy collection is the is the better way to provide energy because I think solar energy wi wo not work in a cluttered environment . ami_da_4
C 250.24 So so I think we can start with these two main things . ami_da_4
C 257.82 For the case well I think that titanium is is a good choice because it is trendy and ami_da_4
C 257.82 it is it is well ami_da_4
C 257.82 it is modern and user are are are will be very happy to have a a a nice remote . ami_da_4
C 282.11 For the interface I think that we can ach achieve all the desired functionalities by s just using rubber buttons , simple buttons and th thus this allow to use a regular chip that are well cheaper . ami_da_4
C 302.92 And s so we can move to the next slide . ami_da_6
B 307.22 Sorry . ami_da_14
C 307.97 Yeah . ami_da_9
B 308.48 What is this single curved what does it mean ? ami_da_5
B 308.48 So it is it is not ami_da_3
B 308.48 Yo l ami_da_1
B 308.48 yeah . ami_da_1
C 311.88 Well i i it is it is the the shape of the of the remote . ami_da_4
C 317.29 You you will have the well the the curve will fit into your hand when you grab the ami_da_4
C 317.29 Yeah . ami_da_9
B 324.7 When you hold on it , it is comfortable to hold . ami_da_4
C 328.31 It is more confog f comfortable that if these it is completely flat . ami_da_4
B 331.14 Okay . ami_da_1
B 333.46 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 333.87 And the battery , is it kind of a rechargeable or it does not matter ? ami_da_5
B 333.87 That that is what it means by kinetic . ami_da_4
C 338.27 Yeah the that is the point . ami_da_4
C 340.85 The kinetic one is y you can recharge by the ami_da_4
C 340.85 Yeah ami_da_9
C 340.85 and by well by just by moving the ar your arm the well the remote will accumulate energy . ami_da_4
B 351.87 Okay . ami_da_1
B 357.44 Okay . ami_da_1
C 357.99 But I d I do not know it is if it is feasible because I do not know ami_da_4
C 357.99 if yet if if the user will move enough to provide the remote all the necessary energy . ami_da_4
B 369.8 Okay . ami_da_1
B 371.59 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 373.2 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 373.91 We we might check with our R and D department to see if they have this product ready for market . ami_da_6
C 378.39 Yeah . ami_da_9
C 381.83 And yeah and ami_da_3
C 381.83 so can you go to the next slide please . ami_da_6
C 386.93 So and that is that summarize well what I have said . ami_da_4
C 394.41 So you are right ami_da_9
C 394.41 we can see in our R and D if the kinetic metal is sufficient to provide enough energy . ami_da_4
B 394.6 Wha ami_da_3
B 394.6 the department . ami_da_4
C 406.99 That is it . ami_da_4
B 411.43 So I keep in touch with the R and D department . ami_da_5
C 436.76 Oh yeah ami_da_4
C 436.76 I take care , ami_da_4
C 436.76 it is all right . ami_da_9
B 443.19 So the titanium case is the normal case that ami_da_4
B 443.19 I will show you some pictures that I have ami_da_7
B 443.19 and you tell me whether they are titanium case or not . ami_da_8
C 452.99 All right . ami_da_7
B 453.11 Because I am not very sure , plastic , titanium or whatever . ami_da_4
C 454.75 Yeah . ami_da_7
B 458.63 There is another point I want to make , ami_da_7
B 458.63 is that the well you have seen them I le na my presentation that I point out some why buttons are not the not the only ways you can use ami_da_4
B 458.63 Yeah . ami_da_6
B 477.41 Yeah , maybe n ami_da_6
B 477.41 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 498.88 Three . ami_da_4
B 506.26 So the user interface is i it uses the aspect of a computer system , a programme which can be seen or heard or otherwise perceived by the human user and the commands and mechanism the user uses to control its operation and input data . ami_da_4
B 527.5 So you s ami_da_4
B 527.5 this gives you the ways to input data ami_da_4
B 527.5 and we have we are more ami_da_3
B 527.5 we emphasise more on the graphical user interface here . ami_da_4
B 536.28 The idea is to represent buttons as figures , diagrams , symbols and on ami_da_4
B 536.28 so you ami_da_4
B 536.28 you can easily when you look at the symbols you understand what it is doing . ami_da_4
A 546.94 What is the function of this button . ami_da_4
B 548.19 Yeah . ami_da_9
B 548.8 Yeah . ami_da_9
B 549.92 So . ami_da_9
A 551.24 I think it makes the the interface really ami_da_9
A 551.24 Graphical user interface . ami_da_16
B 554.35 Ea easy to use . ami_da_9
B 559.25 So next one . ami_da_6
B 562.08 function five . ami_da_3
B 565.43 So I can use the button , the mouse maybe . ami_da_7
A 567.54 A graphical user interface emphasise the use of pictures . ami_da_4
B 570.07 Yeah . ami_da_9
B 572.55 So next line . ami_da_6
B 574.23 So the here are some examples . ami_da_4
B 576.97 So they cluster the buttons together . ami_da_4
B 580.02 They group them into col they colour them and they have different forms as well . ami_da_4
B 588.43 but this interface are kind of confusing . ami_da_9
B 593.68 basically there are too many buttons . ami_da_4
B 596.93 Right . ami_da_6
B 597.49 Next one . ami_da_6
C 597.91 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 601.09 So some people are propose voice recognition ami_da_4
B 601.09 and so ami_da_3
B 601.09 by the way I receive an email from the from one our departments saying that the voice recognition has been used in the coffee machine for this by a company when you tell the you say good morning coffee machine and the machine are reply to you . ami_da_4
B 621.59 So I just got an email saying that . ami_da_4
B 624.52 And it seems like this voice recognition technology is ready to be used ami_da_4
B 624.52 so we might consider that , supposedly . ami_da_6
C 631.87 Yeah fine . ami_da_9
B 634.4 The next one . ami_da_6
B 639.11 so somebody some people use some people use a spinning wheel th with the LC display so instead of using the buttons you have a LCD screen and then there you can u you can use that as buttons , you can use that as real so so that could be an option as well . ami_da_4
B 660.4 Touch screen , I mean . ami_da_4
A 661.47 Yeah . ami_da_9
B 662.49 Next one . ami_da_6
B 666.33 And some people propose a scroll button . ami_da_4
B 669.91 Integrated with push buttons or you may have scroll button instead of p just the push button . ami_da_4
B 675.9 Like the one we have here . ami_da_4
B 678.49 , next one . ami_da_6
B 684.31 So ami_da_2
B 684.31 so there are a few aspects that I collected here . ami_da_4
B 695.62 So s basically this deals with special users , children , handicapped people , old people , ami_da_4
B 695.62 and and prog ami_da_3
B 695.62 basically they are programmable , specially for children . ami_da_4
B 711.76 And ami_da_2
B 711.76 yeah yeah . ami_da_2
B 717.07 And then they also secure covers , to protect secure and hidden programming and battery covers that will protect your settings . ami_da_4
B 728.21 So ami_da_2
B 728.21 But we do not have to integrate all these complicated features . ami_da_4
B 733.31 I am just saying that the currently in the market there are there are control there are remote controllers f customisable for different people . ami_da_4
B 745.11 Yeah , so that is the point . ami_da_4
B 747.69 The next one . ami_da_6
B 754.39 And you see this is the one where you have the protection cover . ami_da_4
B 758.79 maybe useful for children , ami_da_6
B 758.79 they migh you you ami_da_4
B 758.79 they only see the buttons outside . ami_da_4
B 764.28 And for adults wh where you have more control you can see the one inside . ami_da_4
B 768.62 So the adults might want to have a key to lock that to pr so children will not touch the button inside . ami_da_6
C 774.97 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 775.86 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 776.47 S a good idea . ami_da_9
B 779.32 The next one . ami_da_6
B 780.96 So this guy ami_da_3
B 780.96 this is another company that provides big buttons . ami_da_4
B 786.4 At ami_da_3
B 786.4 I see that that is useful for old people and then you do not get it lost . ami_da_4
B 791.17 But for our product we do not need a big one because you have voice recognition e eventually with use . ami_da_4
C 796.26 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 798.19 And you can call your remote controller if you do not know where it is . ami_da_4
B 803.22 TV remote controller where are you ? ami_da_16
B 803.22 And then , he will beeps and to say that I am here , for example . ami_da_4
B 811.6 Is it possible ? ami_da_5
B 811.6 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 812.62 We should include speech synthesis in this case , no ? ami_da_6
D 812.81 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 813.04 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 816.6 Yeah ami_da_9
C 816.6 but as Norman say if there is already a commercial product available who t who do this we we can check to integrate it i into our new remote control . ami_da_4
D 816.66 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 825.05 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 826.44 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 829.35 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 830.36 And , this is another one ami_da_4
B 830.36 where you can ami_da_3
B 830.36 the the the part that is a V standing for the volume . ami_da_4
B 839.46 So there is a up arrow and a down arrow . ami_da_4
B 842.4 But you the see that in the V , the V appears to be the down arrow on the top ami_da_4
B 842.4 on the top up arrow if you ami_da_3
B 842.4 up arrow there is a V like as as if it is turning down ami_da_4
B 842.4 so it is confusing interface , ami_da_9
B 842.4 so I want to avoid this kind of thing in the design . ami_da_4
C 854.48 Yeah yeah . ami_da_1
B 858.42 And here are is here is a s short summary that I summary that I compiled after the findings I found . ami_da_4
B 865.49 Big buttons are convenient , voice recognition helps , push buttons , scroll buttons , spinning wheels can be used as navigation tools . ami_da_4
B 875.22 And user customisable is important and finally simplicity simplicity is the key . ami_da_4
B 881.62 Yeah . ami_da_2
B 881.94 So ami_da_2
B 881.94 we have many concepts there ami_da_4
B 881.94 but we have to choose later on which ones are important to be used . ami_da_4
C 887.62 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 891.06 And basically ami_da_3
B 891.06 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 891.28 Well I I think you it is ami_da_9
C 891.28 it is it is fine you have reviewed all all the possibilities ami_da_9
C 891.28 but well i if we consider that the user interface is displayed on the TV screen I do not think we nee ami_da_4
C 891.28 we need much buttons in the remote since we we just have to navigate and to have a okay or enter key or things like that , because adding wheels or scrolls makes the thing more complicated and more expensive also , ami_da_4
C 891.28 so . ami_da_4
B 915.55 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 930.97 Okay . ami_da_1
A 931.78 Or maybe we can include the user manual in the in the remote control and we should have just a button like help and you say and you ik you press the button help and maybe you see the the user m might in the in the TV . ami_da_6
C 949.46 Yeah . ami_da_9
C 949.99 That is a good idea . ami_da_9
C 951.46 To have a help button . ami_da_4
B 953.5 A help button . ami_da_12
C 954.24 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 954.27 Yeah . ami_da_9
B 954.67 So you are display on the screen . ami_da_5
C 956.8 On the TV screen . ami_da_4
A 956.82 On TV TV screen . ami_da_4
B 956.86 So on the TV screen . ami_da_12
C 957.74 On the TV screen the how to use your remote . ami_da_4
A 958.71 So just you push the button ami_da_4
A 958.71 and we will ami_da_3
A 958.71 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 959.75 Okay . ami_da_1
B 961.28 Okay . ami_da_1
D 961.86 Oh . ami_da_1
B 962.58 Okay . ami_da_1
B 963.14 So that eliminates all the complicated documentation , ami_da_4
B 963.14 okay . ami_da_2
B 969.11 So wi ami_da_3
B 969.11 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 969.12 But people are often enough looking at the help , once they see the help button they say oh this is a complicated stuff . ami_da_4
A 972.1 If the if ami_da_3
A 972.1 No ami_da_9
A 972.1 In the case where they need help , in the case where they need help . ami_da_3
C 977.21 yeah . ami_da_9
D 978.15 It is a psychology . ami_da_4
C 980.25 In a marketing point of view . ami_da_4
D 980.98 Okay . ami_da_9
D 981.56 And let us see what the market demands . ami_da_6
D 984.54 We could just go to my presentation . ami_da_6
A 984.78 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 985.73 But wel well I think ami_da_3
C 985.73 well . ami_da_1
A 987.57 It is just for user customizable , for kids or old people . ami_da_4
D 989.97 Yeah that is right . ami_da_9
D 994.01 I mean it just showed us the remote with an cap which could be used for kids ami_da_4
D 994.01 and if you remove the ami_da_6
D 994.01 Same remote with some ami_da_4
D 994.01 Both ami_da_9
D 994.01 yeah . ami_da_9
A 994.22 So ami_da_2
A 994.22 So it is the same ami_da_9
A 994.22 Can be used by both kids and old people . ami_da_4
B 1008.35 Well what I s propose is that you know a remote controller , i it could be a cube , is a small device that looks like a cube and maybe you can just change the the buttons , if you ch turn one side ami_da_6
B 1008.35 you get one one buttons , you turn the other side you get the other buttons , so for maybe new generation people who get used to the computer they want lots of controls . ami_da_6
A 1037.65 Maybe for kids , ami_da_6
A 1037.65 kids they like ami_da_3
A 1037.65 t no l ami_da_3
A 1037.65 they like to ami_da_3
A 1037.65 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 1040.5 Small ami_da_3
B 1040.5 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 1042.3 So le le let is see what what people want . ami_da_6
B 1044.01 Let is see the market demand . ami_da_6
D 1045.52 And then we can decide what what we can ami_da_6
D 1045.52 yeah . ami_da_6
B 1046.18 What what market ami_da_3
B 1046.18 yes yes . ami_da_3
D 1070.37 So we just made an marketing survey of what people need from our remotes and how it could be special from the other remotes . ami_da_4
D 1081.53 And we got the best on the responses from the questionnaires . ami_da_4
D 1086.27 we also have some prizes for the most creative solutions . ami_da_4
D 1089.72 And we found the following solutions which we could which would be helpful for our design . ami_da_4
D 1096.03 So seventy percent of the users , they find their remote controls very ugly , they do not find it pleasant to use in the size or usage or anything . ami_da_4
D 1106.33 And eighty percent of the people they are always l ami_da_4
D 1106.33 I mean they are willing to spend more money if the remote control would look fancy . ami_da_4
D 1116.63 And the current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour of the user . ami_da_4
D 1122.21 And seventy five percent of the users said they zap a lot . ami_da_4
D 1128.39 And fifty percent say they use only ten percent of the buttons , so the rest of the ninety percent of the buttons they are not used most of the times . ami_da_4
C 1132.15 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 1134.79 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 1136.12 Yes . ami_da_1
D 1137.03 So this were the findings which we found . ami_da_4
D 1139.75 And also they cited frustrations with the present remote controls . ami_da_4
D 1144.71 Most of ami_da_3
D 1144.71 fifty percent of the time the remote controls are lost somewhere in the room and people are always searching for them rather than watching the TV . ami_da_4
B 1153.57 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 1154.16 And by the time they found the remote control the program is finished . ami_da_4
D 1157.61 So they are frustrated a lot ami_da_4
D 1157.61 And if the remote control is too complicated it takes much time to learn the functionality of it . ami_da_4
C 1157.66 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 1167.39 , the functionalities ami_da_9
C 1167.39 yeah . ami_da_9
D 1169.43 So you can just see the percentage , fifty percent people ami_da_4
D 1169.43 they responded that they always lose their remotes and thirty four percent ami_da_4
D 1169.43 they say that it is quite difficult to learn if it is too complex . ami_da_4
C 1181.21 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 1182.82 So keeping in view all these findings and the frustrations I think this should be the solution for them . ami_da_4
D 1191.11 We should have an LCD on the rem remote control . ami_da_5
B 1195.78 Oh . ami_da_16
C 1196.75 Well w well I ami_da_9
C 1196.75 I ami_da_9
C 1196.75 I do not really see the advantage of having LCD on the on the remote control if we have a a a big screen and display on the screen . ami_da_9
B 1203.81 Big screen . ami_da_4
C 1207.47 It is ami_da_3
C 1207.47 yeah of course it is fancy trendy and so on ami_da_4
C 1207.47 but it is it is expensive to produce ami_da_4
C 1207.47 and it is not really ami_da_3
C 1207.47 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 1207.57 I mean as our survey says that people are willing to pay more if their remotes are fancy . ami_da_4
D 1221.24 So if we have a LCD on the remote , rather than looking onto the TV you just look into a remote and navigate it . ami_da_4
D 1228.28 It is the same menu as we have saw that iPod remote control . ami_da_4
B 1229.51 yeah . ami_da_1
C 1232.32 Yeah yeah . ami_da_1
D 1233.57 We just play around ami_da_4
D 1233.57 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 1234.59 The thing ami_da_3
B 1234.59 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 1235.17 Yeah but when you play with the iPod you do not have a big screen in front of you , s ami_da_4
C 1235.17 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 1239.22 You can use this screen instead of the big se screen , ami_da_4
A 1239.22 instead of use the yeah . ami_da_3
B 1239.5 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 1241.41 Yeah . ami_da_9
B 1242.47 If you re use the existing screen , we element eliminate the LCD , after all the LCD just to display and if you have the colourful screen you can make the display colourful , fancy , as fancy as the one on the LCD , maybe even better . ami_da_4
D 1253.81 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 1257.73 So ami_da_2
B 1257.73 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 1258.98 I mean this were the points which we got from the market demands . ami_da_4
C 1262.07 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 1262.24 Yeah yeah . ami_da_1
D 1263.52 So ami_da_2
D 1263.52 Yeah that is fine . ami_da_9
B 1263.64 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 1264.62 So I th ami_da_3
C 1264.62 I ami_da_3
C 1264.62 I ami_da_3
C 1264.62 well I think we we can focus on the on the fancy look ami_da_6
C 1264.62 on the ami_da_3
C 1264.62 on the speech recognition if the technology is available but well I think LCD will will make us spend a lot of money for not so big results . ami_da_4
B 1270.36 Yeah . ami_da_9
B 1270.83 More on a fancy design . ami_da_6
D 1272.78 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 1273.48 I mean that is ami_da_3
B 1277.28 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 1285.81 Remember we have a s budget for the cost of producing the remote controller . ami_da_4
A 1286.67 But ami_da_3
A 1286.67 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 1292.63 Yeah . ami_da_3
D 1292.86 yeah we have ami_da_3
D 1292.86 I mean that should be found out by the Industrial Designers . ami_da_4
B 1292.99 So i is ami_da_3
B 1292.99 so the thing is you can find out how much an LCD will cost ami_da_6
B 1292.99 and then we will decide again . ami_da_6
B 1303.76 maybe you can find out the price and tell us next time . ami_da_6
C 1307.24 So price of LCD display . ami_da_7
B 1307.4 Is i if i ami_da_3
B 1307.4 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 1310.88 And it is always good to have an voice recognition for the remote controls . ami_da_9
C 1311.22 And ami_da_3
C 1311.22 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 1313.93 Yeah . ami_da_9
B 1314.7 And also the cost for the speech recognition . ami_da_6
B 1317.51 Ask our R and D department . ami_da_6
A 1318.09 It is for ami_da_3
A 1318.09 it is just for small vocabulary . ami_da_4
B 1320.85 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 1320.85 Yeah it is o only for a limited vocabulary , say eighty commands or so . ami_da_4
A 1321.16 We it is not ami_da_3
A 1321.16 yeah . ami_da_1
B 1322.64 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 1323.43 And ho ami_da_3
B 1323.43 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 1324.97 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 1325.1 Yeah okay . ami_da_9
B 1326.08 And also the scroller button , how much will it cost . ami_da_6
C 1326.34 And ami_da_3
C 1326.34 Well compared to the to s the simpl simpler simplest button . ami_da_5
A 1334.87 Yeah . ami_da_4
D 1335.3 , the scroll button , ami_da_9
D 1335.3 from the survey we never see that people would like to have some scrolling button . ami_da_4
A 1335.54 Push push . ami_da_4
C 1340.68 Yeah . ami_da_3
D 1341.78 Because they they just they are just frightened to use the scrollings or help button . ami_da_4
C 1341.8 Yeah I think that ami_da_3
C 1341.8 Yeah ami_da_4
C 1341.8 I ami_da_4
C 1341.8 I ami_da_4
C 1341.8 I think that well as we have seen in the in the presentation well about fifty percent of the of the percent n choose the button ami_da_4
C 1341.8 so I think to have five simple button is sufficient for our functionality . ami_da_4
B 1344.71 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 1356.38 Do not use the buttons . ami_da_4
B 1360.96 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 1362.45 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 1363.39 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 1364.68 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 1365.12 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 1365.22 It does not mean that the other buttons are not necessary or important . ami_da_4
B 1369.13 Important . ami_da_4
C 1371.09 Yeah . ami_da_9
C 1371.75 But ami_da_9
C 1371.75 But the the thing is is ami_da_6
C 1371.75 i is that we can add a functionality on the on the TV screen like a a list of function ami_da_6
C 1371.75 and then you choose with the with the button to well you navigate ami_da_6
C 1371.75 and you ami_da_3
C 1371.75 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 1371.97 But they are just less used compar ami_da_4
A 1371.97 yeah . ami_da_9
D 1373.19 They are not used much . ami_da_4
B 1381.54 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 1383.91 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 1387.06 Yeah , ami_da_1
B 1387.06 yeah . ami_da_1
B 1388.45 So so the at most more power . ami_da_6
A 1389.42 Or maybe we can u ami_da_6
A 1389.42 or maybe we can make this the ten percent of button more bigger than the others . ami_da_6
A 1399.29 So . ami_da_2
C 1399.97 But if i i if we if we could have a a a display g a user interface that is very complete on the TV screen ami_da_4
C 1399.97 I think that just five buttons are sufficient , ami_da_4
C 1399.97 one to go up left right down and enter and ami_da_6
C 1399.97 you you ami_da_6
C 1399.97 you just select the functionality you want to access or things like that . ami_da_6
B 1414.5 Yep . ami_da_1
B 1417.99 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 1423.71 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 1424.15 You do not have to to switch to a channel to another ami_da_4
C 1424.15 Yeah ami_da_9
C 1424.15 but ami_da_9
C 1424.15 Yeah but if you look at the LCD ami_da_4
C 1424.15 you you do not look at the TV screen ami_da_4
C 1424.15 so i i it is not really worth to get to have the image if you do not look at , so . ami_da_4
B 1426.98 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 1428.65 Or it could be like this , as the people say , if they have a LCD on the remote not on the television . ami_da_6
D 1434.05 Because when you have the LCD onto the television screen you miss the picture in the background , we are most focused on the commands . ami_da_4
D 1443.22 So if you have then LCD in the remote , you just have a menu , and increasing and lower these signs here to change the programs and this menu when you press the menu , in the LCD displays as you go on pressing the menu it faster displays volume , then the program , then the brightness , contrast and all the stuff . ami_da_6
D 1464.21 And accordingly you can just increase or decrease . ami_da_6
A 1466.87 It is ami_da_3
A 1466.87 And I think it is increases the cost of the the remote control if you use LCD . ami_da_4
B 1471.14 I if ami_da_3
B 1475.59 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 1478.66 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 1479.75 Yeah ami_da_9
D 1479.75 that has to be checked out . ami_da_6
B 1480.95 I think that there is no contradiction here , ami_da_9
B 1480.95 because if there are few buttons , you do not have to look at your your controller any more because you know where the buttons are , so if you want to control the screen d sh sharpness ami_da_4
B 1480.95 you just say sharpness ami_da_4
B 1480.95 and then you t turn you just press lef increase or decrease button and the same for the volume and the channel , ami_da_4
B 1480.95 if you had the speech recognition there you just shout your channel , just tell your channel ami_da_4
B 1480.95 and then you do not even have to look at the butto at the controller so finally that wil eliminates the the need for LCD , with the help of speech recogniser ami_da_4
B 1480.95 you can ami_da_4
B 1480.95 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 1481.46 I ami_da_4
A 1481.46 You will listen to a peep , special peep . ami_da_6
C 1490.73 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 1503.88 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 1514.76 Okay . ami_da_1
D 1521.24 I mean , better if we could just check all the cost with LCD and also with the speech recognition . ami_da_6
C 1526.56 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 1526.79 And then we could find which would would be a more suitable in this case . ami_da_4
B 1530.51 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 1531.34 A and ami_da_3
D 1532.79 And the third problem was to find the remote control . ami_da_4
D 1535.6 Always , so fifty percent of the people say they lose the remotes . ami_da_4
C 1540.18 Well so we we can think about a well a a vocal command like find and when the remote control hears fine well ami_da_6
C 1540.18 yeah ami_da_6
C 1540.18 just to make him beep or t ami_da_6
C 1540.18 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 1540.18 Yeah that is right , ami_da_9
D 1540.18 that is exactly what I mean by voice commander . ami_da_4
B 1549.46 Where , ami_da_6
B 1549.46 yeah . ami_da_1
D 1557.47 Or it could be also something like this , ami_da_6
D 1557.47 it is always boring to change the batteries of the remotes control , ami_da_4
D 1557.47 so we have some one charger there ami_da_6
D 1557.47 and whenever we do not use the remote control we put it in the charger . ami_da_6
B 1558.22 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 1563.21 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 1568.4 Put it back at the charge . ami_da_6
C 1568.77 Put ami_da_3
C 1568.77 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 1569.84 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 1570.51 And when we are using that t remote and if we misplace somewhere , in the charger we have a small button , and just by pressing the button in the charger the remote control beeps , wherever it is . ami_da_6
B 1581.29 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 1581.32 Okay . ami_da_1
C 1582.55 And that is a good idea , that is simple , like in phones . ami_da_9
A 1584.58 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 1585.38 I mean it doe it also does not require a voice command , because there are problems with a voice command . ami_da_4
C 1588.53 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 1588.94 But you do not you do not have to move the the charger . ami_da_4
D 1591.54 Yeah , ami_da_9
D 1591.54 yeah , ami_da_9
D 1591.54 yeah . ami_da_9
D 1592.25 I mean charger would be fixed because it is always with electricity plugged . ami_da_4
B 1592.41 Th ami_da_3
B 1592.41 yeah . ami_da_3
A 1592.61 You have to keep it . ami_da_3
C 1593.85 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 1594.26 yeah . ami_da_3
C 1595.08 Yeah if there if there there is nuff not enough battery . ami_da_6
B 1595.26 Yeah . ami_da_3
A 1595.6 Okay . ami_da_1
B 1599.23 There is . ami_da_3
C 1599.23 Also and the remote is lost . ami_da_6
B 1602.12 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 1602.37 Yeah that is right . ami_da_9
B 1603.22 That we can ami_da_3
B 1603.22 what we can do is we can program a function whereby when you press the switch off TV button , the off button , the remote there be s instruction on the screen , please charge charge me . ami_da_6
C 1615.78 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 1616.07 You never get it lost ami_da_4
B 1616.07 because every time you are off the computer the TV you are asked the the command the TV com remote controller would tell you to put it back to where to the charger . ami_da_6
D 1626.34 It is an good reminder , yeah that is right . ami_da_9
B 1627.72 Yeah . ami_da_4
B 1628.18 So you will never get lost ami_da_4
B 1628.18 yeah . ami_da_4
C 1630.12 Okay . ami_da_1
A 1632.77 Maybe for some people lazy people . ami_da_14
B 1635.96 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 1637.01 Yeah ami_da_1
B 1637.01 because everything is programmed inside . ami_da_4
A 1639.16 Yeah yeah . ami_da_1
B 1639.76 So it is it is it is all about strategy , y ami_da_4
D 1644.76 And of course the final point is a fancy look . ami_da_4
D 1648.15 As we have seen earlier the remotes which were displayed by Norman they were not fancy , ami_da_4
D 1648.15 I mean very big or something with lot of buttons . ami_da_4
C 1654.2 They were ugly . ami_da_9
C 1655.96 They ami_da_3
C 1655.96 Well the last one with the yeah with the two parts was original , so ami_da_9
C 1655.96 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 1656.46 Yeah , ami_da_1
B 1656.46 yeah . ami_da_1
D 1659.33 I think we should have something it ami_da_3
D 1659.33 I mean I mean I mean you see if it is like that even a kid who wants to have a control he could just plug it and use it ami_da_4
D 1659.33 , you ca not avoid him . ami_da_4
B 1664.01 With two two two parts controller . ami_da_4
D 1678.79 But you can have an button for child lock . ami_da_6
B 1681.83 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 1682.8 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 1683.73 So just by pressing the button with some code , you t you put a lock onto the remote , so that he ca not use even ami_da_6
D 1683.73 That is right . ami_da_9
C 1689.65 Well we can think about having on the on the on the user interface when you switch on the TV you can well write a code or choose a category , if it is kids , things like that . ami_da_6
A 1702.05 Or ami_da_3
A 1702.05 Or maybe you have to to show some specific programmes for kids ami_da_6
A 1702.05 and then just just yeah just push kids button ami_da_6
A 1702.05 so it is automatically ami_da_6
B 1705.49 Yeah . ami_da_9
B 1714.94 these are probl ami_da_3
B 1714.94 yeah . ami_da_1
A 1724.28 So if he . ami_da_3
D 1727.71 I think these other four points they are the market demands ami_da_4
D 1727.71 and so it is for the user interface design and industrial design to just think ami_da_4
D 1727.71 Yeah ami_da_4
D 1727.71 I think it should be clearer for us in the next meeting that th these could be included . ami_da_4
C 1733.53 So for ami_da_3
C 1733.53 yeah . ami_da_1
A 1734.34 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 1735.91 So for my part I will check the prices the the prices difference of what to use , where to use , and s and so on . ami_da_7
C 1748.4 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 1750.74 I think we need to define also a s the set of vocabularies for the speech recogniser ami_da_6
B 1750.74 because if you want say we can sort by channels or sort by TV programs , you have to decide a category of vocabularies for them . ami_da_4
C 1756.69 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 1769.69 If numbers , they are easy , but if name the channel by by name ami_da_4
C 1775.2 Well I think we can we can have just numbers for channels ami_da_6
C 1775.2 and you can say to your remote control like sports and then on the TV you have a list with with well with sports program playing now ami_da_6
C 1775.2 and and ami_da_3
C 1775.2 That is right , yeah ami_da_9
C 1775.2 , yeah . ami_da_9
D 1790.57 No , ami_da_9
D 1790.57 we have a problem there . ami_da_4
D 1792.37 You see if you have a voice commands and you are s you are watching a score on basketball score or something , and if the score comes twenty four thirty five , you have just say twenty five and suddenly the screen the channel goes to twenty five . ami_da_4
A 1803.37 Yeah it is ami_da_1
A 1803.37 yeah . ami_da_1
D 1807.89 So I think there should be a prefix to some numbers ami_da_6
D 1807.89 I mean the the you just check all the probability that saying TV twenty five and just ordinary twenty five . ami_da_4
C 1810.33 Well but well e every possible word has a probability to come about of the TV so . ami_da_4
B 1817.15 Yeah . ami_da_1
C 1823.65 Yeah yeah . ami_da_1
D 1823.83 Ordinary twenty five you almost there is a probability of being said around sixty seventy percent and TV twenty five ami_da_4
D 1823.83 I dunno it will be round about one or two percent . ami_da_4
C 1827.31 Yeah but well ami_da_3
C 1827.31 okay . ami_da_1
D 1834.47 So it is better to have some prefix before the number . ami_da_4
B 1837.82 But I I I think that the user would like wou would like to associate the channel or call the channel rather than than the numbers . ami_da_4
D 1844.6 Yeah something , some code . ami_da_9
B 1845.77 You say numbe channel number five of the TV correspond to something else in the channel . ami_da_4
C 1851.09 Yeah yeah . ami_da_1
B 1851.93 So some people may want to say , I want to see this channel . ami_da_6
C 1856.13 Well I ami_da_3
C 1856.13 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 1856.2 That will be too big . ami_da_4
D 1857.61 And it will be difficult for the vocabulary also . ami_da_4
A 1857.92 Or just ami_da_3
A 1857.92 It is difficult to to just say the the name of the channel . ami_da_4
B 1859.88 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 1860.79 Check with the v R and D department the capability of recogniser . ami_da_6
B 1866.95 Well , it is convenient for the user . ami_da_4
A 1867.08 It will be difficult to say just the name of the channel . ami_da_4
A 1870.93 Because you have to s t a ch ami_da_3
A 1870.93 yeah ami_da_9
A 1870.93 but you have to to have all the name of the channel in your vocabulary . ami_da_4
D 1879.68 Als might be you just forgot the channel name , you kno only know the number . ami_da_4
A 1880.77 Or maybe ami_da_3
A 1880.77 Or maybe the user can create his own vocabulary , just pronouncing the the name of channels and include in the vocabulary . ami_da_6
D 1883.82 Then Yeah , the . ami_da_3
B 1884.32 The . ami_da_3
B 1890.29 I ami_da_3
B 1890.29 I think that I have ami_da_3
B 1890.29 I think there is another way you can do is that you can if when the user ch press a button to choose the channel for example , then what you can do is that the you can make the TV screen to split them into small little little squares of images where you you you have a snapshot of every channel , so let is say it is a four by four matrix of the images , so now what you do is f looking at the all the sixteen channels available at one time , you just use the control button , you ami_da_6
B 1890.29 just you ami_da_6
B 1890.29 you just choose the the option you want ami_da_6
B 1890.29 and then you just hit the button ami_da_6
B 1890.29 and then you go to that channel . ami_da_6
B 1933.46 So ami_da_2
A 1934.23 Or lets the user create his own vocabulary of channel . ami_da_6
B 1939.38 So you you do not use the speech recogniser in that way . ami_da_5
A 1942.87 No . ami_da_9
A 1943.57 Just you have in the beginning you have t ami_da_6
A 1943.57 you have to train you have to create the vocabulary by yourself . ami_da_6
B 1952.16 Oh , okay . ami_da_12
B 1953.3 Yeah . ami_da_12
C 1953.78 Well I I also ami_da_3
C 1953.78 I I also think about another problem , if if there is more than one person who is watching TV ami_da_4
C 1953.78 the s well ami_da_4
C 1953.78 the the speech r recogniser should be able to distinguish between the two . ami_da_4
A 1954.49 By associating each channel with the name or And for each one has his own . ami_da_6
D 1966.85 Yeah yeah , ami_da_9
C 1973.3 Because I remember when I was a young child with my sister ami_da_4
C 1973.3 we ami_da_4
C 1973.3 yeah ami_da_4
C 1973.3 we always want to w to watch different emission at the at the same time ami_da_4
C 1973.3 so it is a pr it could be a problem if if well if someone passes by when you are watching TV and say oh TV thirty and just run , s ami_da_4
C 1973.3 Yeah , ami_da_1
C 1973.3 yeah . ami_da_1
A 1978.4 Or you have to s ami_da_3
A 1978.4 Yeah . ami_da_1
B 1979.94 Yeah , I want to watch this , I want to watch that . ami_da_14
D 1980.56 Yeah . ami_da_1
D 1999.32 A and in the same lines we would have a one more problem . ami_da_4
D 2001.7 If we are using the television in the different environments , say in the factories or in the shops where there is a lot of noise and this voice commands if they fail to work , that would bring a bad name bad reputation for our company . ami_da_4
D 2014.99 So I think we should specify some pre requirements if we want to use a voice commands , say that it should be used in an silent homely environment or s something . ami_da_6
C 2025.37 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 2027.76 Or we can switch on or switch off the the special , yeah . ami_da_6
D 2030.45 Yeah that is right ami_da_9
D 2030.45 that should be an option . ami_da_4
C 2033.13 Yeah that is ami_da_3
C 2033.13 well I think that is a good a good option ami_da_9
C 2033.13 because it is simple and simple to implement also , so . ami_da_4
D 2040.17 I think these are the practical problems . ami_da_4
D 2043.04 So we need to take care of them in the design . ami_da_4
A 2045.45 Maybe we will discuss them in next meeting . ami_da_6
A 2048.02 It is time to close this meeting . ami_da_4
C 2050.52 Okay . ami_da_1
D 2050.91 Okay . ami_da_1
D 2052.69 Oh it came there on three minutes back ami_da_4
D 2052.69 so we are ami_da_4
D 2052.69 I think we can just press the okay . ami_da_6
A 2054.04 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 2058.06 Okay . ami_da_1
C 2059.7 Okay . ami_da_1
D 2064.07 Okay . ami_da_13
