A 75.17 which has to be original , trendy and user friendly . ami_da_4
A 83.59 I took this off our corporate website . ami_da_4
A 85.25 It is ami_da_3
A 85.25 I think well it sums up what we need to do . ami_da_4
A 88.55 We are inspired by latest fashion , not only electronics , but also the latest trends in clothes and interior design . ami_da_4
A 93.6 That is why our product will always fit in your home . ami_da_4

D 103.73 Yeah . ami_da_9
D 105.64 Yeah . ami_da_9
A 106.57 So So ami_da_2
A 106.57 we put the fashion in electronics . ami_da_4
A 109.85 So that is what we need to go for . ami_da_6
A 111.94 Anyway , we will take this project in three steps , three pha three phase of design . ami_da_4
A 116.06 First step will be the functional design . ami_da_4
D 117.85 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 118.68 And that is basically what we are going to do . ami_da_4
A 120.15 Everybody has a piece of individual work and a meeting afterwards , so we can share information ami_da_4
A 120.15 about ami_da_3
A 120.15 So ami_da_2
A 120.15 I am going to keep this short , ami_da_7
A 120.15 since we had a technical problem . ami_da_4
A 126.76 So skip through this . ami_da_7
A 130.88 Okay . ami_da_2
A 132.2 Every meeting we everybody can present their their views and everything , so to help with these , you have we have the SMARTboards here . ami_da_4
A 139.73 We can use a regular PowerPoint presentation . ami_da_4
A 142.89 I am supposed to give you an introduction on this doodling board , ami_da_7
A 142.89 so it is ami_da_3
A 142.89 actually it is very easy . ami_da_9
A 148.99 Like it says , very simple , ami_da_9
A 148.99 you just take out the pen . ami_da_4
A 152.83 Like you see here , I will just take the take here . ami_da_7
A 157.09 That is it , you just put it on the board . ami_da_4
A 159.5 You see a pen here . ami_da_4
A 162.18 You go here , just like using a pen . ami_da_4
A 165.34 You can just draw whatever you want . ami_da_4
A 168.62 It is like the eraser , can erase whatever you want . ami_da_4
A 173.06 And so it will be easy just to illustrate your views , if you want to change the format , you just either take out jus just like the pen , and whatever you want , your current colour , your line width , just to make the line bigger . ami_da_4
A 188.53 So it should be really easy . ami_da_4
D 189.48 Okay . ami_da_1
A 190.18 This is to take the ami_da_3
A 190.18 just take a new slide and back again . ami_da_4
A 193.91 We are just going to keep using this board all the time , ami_da_4
A 193.91 so I think it will be ami_da_3
A 193.91 it is very clear for everyone , I suppose . ami_da_13
A 199.68 So ami_da_2
A 199.68 I will take this out . ami_da_7
A 204.7 Okay . ami_da_2
A 206.05 We will use that later . ami_da_4
A 206.93 Anyway . ami_da_4
A 209.38 Yeah , just just ami_da_2
A 209.38 just stuff that you want to share , just put it in the in the project folder , ami_da_6

A 221.9 So ami_da_2
A 221.9 next , been here . ami_da_16
A 225.61 Well , ami_da_2
A 225.61 going to give the electronic white board a shot . ami_da_7
A 229.25 So ami_da_2
A 229.25 basic idea is we have a blank sheet . ami_da_4
A 234.8 Just try whatever you want , and like it says , draw your favourite animal . ami_da_6
A 240.68 I think the creative genius should go first . ami_da_6
B 243.02 The creative genius ? ami_da_12
B 243.02 Thank you very much . ami_da_14
A 245.93 So , draw us your favourite animal . ami_da_6
B 248.22 Well , ami_da_2
B 248.22 I am more into the technical aspects of drawing , ami_da_4
B 248.22 so I am not really good at drawing animals , ami_da_15
B 248.22 but the animal which I Oh . ami_da_3
A 252.35 Draw us a technical animal . ami_da_14
A 257.11 Yeah , it is still erasing . ami_da_4
B 258.72 Pen . ami_da_16
B 261.05 format . ami_da_16
B 265.18 Else my animal will be like king size . ami_da_4
B 268.56 I pretty much like a dolphin , ami_da_9
B 268.56 because of its its freedom basically . ami_da_4
B 276.06 Let is see . ami_da_2
B 278.17 A head . ami_da_16
B 282.34 actually worked with this . ami_da_4
B 283.7 It is like it is a very high tech . ami_da_9
B 289.44 Bit low responsive though . ami_da_9
B 291.84 Prefer pen and paper . ami_da_9
A 292.49 So that is what we do not want . ami_da_6
A 293.77 We want a high responsive product . ami_da_6
A 295.26 So ami_da_6
A 295.26 It looks more like nuclear bomb . ami_da_14
D 299.83 Very nice dolphin . ami_da_14
B 300.59 It does not look like a nuclear bomb . ami_da_4
B 303.34 This thing is not doing what I am What I want . ami_da_4
B 309.21 So ami_da_2

A 670.04 Examples . ami_da_16
A 670.73 Well ami_da_2
A 670.73 I guess we have a little little time extra , ami_da_4
A 670.73 but ami_da_3
A 670.73 Just a little quick discussion to to open open our work . ami_da_6
A 679.43 So what do you guys think about ami_da_8
A 679.43 The first idea is just very short . ami_da_6
A 682.43 I will start with you . ami_da_6
A 683.17 What are y ami_da_8
A 683.17 What are your first ideas for the new product ? ami_da_8
A 683.17 What ami_da_3
A 683.17 The project I got was just for a TV remote control . ami_da_4
B 687.06 Do ami_da_3
B 687.06 Are we going to introduce a multi remote control ? ami_da_5
B 687.06 Is it just the TV ami_da_5
B 687.06 or do we want to in ami_da_3
B 687.06 Just for TV remote control . ami_da_12
D 692.41 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 695.5 Yeah , I guess so . ami_da_4
B 696.7 Okay . ami_da_12
B 697.64 Well , ami_da_2
B 697.64 I was thinking about design remote control , with our motto and all . ami_da_6
D 698.07 But ami_da_3
D 698.07 Yeah . ami_da_9
B 703.25 thing to keep in mind is that we need to stick to what people are familiar with . ami_da_6
B 710.05 No rational changes or whatever , because it revolutionary changes , ami_da_6
B 710.05 yes . ami_da_9
A 713.66 Okay , ami_da_2
A 713.66 so very intuitive design , I guess . ami_da_11
B 716.93 we might have to consider other design aspects of our product . ami_da_6
B 721.87 So that was something I wanted to add , ami_da_4
B 721.87 and perhaps some usability aspect . ami_da_6
B 728.42 TV is becoming central in most homes . ami_da_4
B 730.41 Do we want people who are disabled in any way to , yeah , to be able to use it as well ? ami_da_5
B 730.41 Yeah . ami_da_1
A 737.13 Yeah , we want ami_da_3
A 737.13 I suppose we want almost everyone to be using it . ami_da_4
A 741.58 So I think I mean , really disabled people , yeah , might be a problem , ami_da_9
A 741.58 but I think it is a little take it into consideration . ami_da_6
A 750.77 yeah . ami_da_2
A 752.18 I think we really need to cut the meeting short . ami_da_4
A 753.87 You have anything you want to share quickly ? ami_da_5
A 753.87 It should be light , okay . ami_da_12
C 755.87 Only one thing that has to be added according to me ami_da_4
C 755.87 is the the material it is made of , it should be something light . ami_da_6
C 763.0 That is ami_da_3
C 763.0 it speaks for itself , ami_da_4
