# Focused Summarization of Meetings and Dialogues: Master Thesis

Steps:

1. Under the "PrepareData" folder, run the DataPrep notebook.
This will create two new folders "DialogueActFiles" and "DicisionFiles" and also split the training and testing data sets from them.
	
2. Now, run the BERT_Data_Prep notebook to create the files required for BERT training and evaluation.

I have lost the exact code while changing my laptop and my external hard disk got corrupted and lost all data.
I have uploaded all the backup files available.

They may not be cleaned and may not run right away.
The links will have to be corrected before running the model.

Also, a named 'bert_model.ckpt.data-00000-of-00001' could not be uploaded under the 'cased_L-12_H-768_A-12' folder due to size constraints.
